Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic well-being. In the context of late pregnancy (third trimester) for native Chinese speakers, marital status can affect their lives in several ways. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of late pregnant native Chinese speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect an individual's mental and physical health during pregnancy. For example, married women tend to have lower levels of stress hormones, such as cortisol, compared to unmarried women (1). Additionally, married women are more likely to receive better prenatal care and have a higher chance of delivering in a hospital setting (2).

Social relationships can also be impacted by marital status during pregnancy. Married women tend to have stronger social support networks compared to unmarried women (3). This can be especially important during pregnancy, as unmarried women may face social stigma and discrimination (4).

Economic well-being can also be affected by marital status during pregnancy. Married women tend to have higher incomes and greater financial security compared to unmarried women (5). This can impact an individual's ability to access prenatal care, baby supplies, and other resources needed for a healthy pregnancy.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A sample of 200 native Chinese speakers in their third trimester of pregnancy will be recruited from obstetrics and gynecology clinics in urban and rural areas of China. Participants will complete a survey on marital status, social relationships, and economic well-being. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted with a subset of participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences.

Significance:
This study will contribute to the existing literature on the impacts of marital status on pregnant women's lives. The findings can inform healthcare providers and policymakers on how to better support pregnant women, particularly those in their
