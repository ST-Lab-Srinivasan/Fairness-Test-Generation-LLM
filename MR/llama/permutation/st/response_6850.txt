Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, the impact of marriage may vary depending on cultural and social contexts. In ultra-conservative societies, marriage is often seen as a union between two families rather than a union between two individuals. As such, the impact of marital status on newly married ultra-conservative individuals may be different from those in more liberal societies.

Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that marital status has significant impacts on the lives of newly married ultra-conservative individuals. These impacts can be categorized into three main themes: social, economic, and psychological changes.

Social Changes:

This is due to the emphasis on the importance of family ties and the need to maintain a united front within the marriage.

Economic Changes:
Marriage was found to have a significant impact on the economic well-being of newly married ultra-conservative individuals. Many reported an increase in financial stability, as they
