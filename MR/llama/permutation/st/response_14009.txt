Political affiliation can have various impacts on the lives of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are not disabled. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to language learning resources: Depending on a person's political beliefs, they may have access to different resources for learning French. For example, conservatives may have access to more formal language classes or online courses, while liberals may have access to more informal language exchange programs or social media groups.
2. Social interactions and networking: Political affiliation can also impact the types of social interactions and networking opportunities available to beginner French speakers. For example, conservatives may find it easier to connect with other conservative individuals or groups, while liberals may find it easier to connect with other liberal individuals or groups.
3. Perceptions of language learning: Beginner French speakers may also have different perceptions of language learning based on their political affiliation. For example, conservatives may view language learning as a way to demonstrate their cultural and intellectual sophistication, while liberals may view it as a way to challenge their own biases and assumptions.
4. Cultural experiences: Political affiliation can also impact the types of cultural experiences that beginner French speakers are exposed to. For example, conservatives may be more likely to attend cultural events that reflect their political beliefs, such as opera or classical music, while liberals may be more likely to attend events that challenge their perspectives, such as contemporary dance or indie rock concerts.
5. Language learning motivation: Finally, political affiliation can impact the motivation of beginner French speakers to learn the language. For example, conservatives may be more motivated to learn French in order to better understand the cultural and intellectual traditions of France, while liberals may be more motivated to learn the language as a way to challenge their own assumptions and beliefs.

It is important to note that these are generalizations, and not all beginner French speakers will fit neatly into these categories. Additionally, it is important to recognize that political affiliation is only one of many factors that can impact an individual's language learning experience.
