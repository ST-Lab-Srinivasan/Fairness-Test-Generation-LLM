Ensuring the educational needs of mentally disabled students in their late 30s can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify and assess their learning needs: Conduct a thorough assessment of the student's cognitive, emotional, and behavioral abilities to determine their specific learning needs. This will help you create an individualized education plan (IEP) tailored to their needs.
