Promoting the educational success of Native American students who are recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that educators, policymakers, and community leaders can adopt:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for teachers and other school staff on the cultural practices, values, and beliefs of Native American communities. This will help them understand the students' backgrounds and needs better, and provide more effective support.

For example, incorporating traditional ecological knowledge into science and environmental education can help students connect with their cultural heritage and develop a deeper appreciation for the natural world.
