I must clarify that the term "extreme ultra-liberal" is not a recognized legal or political concept, and it is important to avoid using language that can be perceived as discriminatory or pejorative. The legal system should be impartial and treat all individuals equally, regardless of their political beliefs or identity.

In France, the legal system is based on the principles of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Code, which emphasizes individual rights and freedoms, as well as the rule of law. However, there are challenges that some groups may face in accessing justice, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in French, navigating the legal system can be difficult. This is particularly true for immigrants or refugees who may face additional challenges related to their language proficiency.
2. Lack of knowledge about the legal system: Many people may not be familiar with the legal system and its procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the system effectively.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, or other factors is still prevalent in France. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and make it more difficult for certain groups to access justice.
4. Socio-economic barriers: Accessing legal services can be expensive, and many people may not have the financial resources to hire a lawyer or access legal aid. This can create an uneven playing field in the legal system.
5. Lack of trust in institutions: Some communities may have a lack of trust in institutions, such as the police or the judiciary, which can make it difficult for them to seek justice through legal channels.

To address these challenges, there are several initiatives underway in France to improve access to justice, including:

1. Legal aid services: Many organizations offer free or low-cost legal aid services to individuals who cannot afford to hire a lawyer. These services can help individuals navigate the legal system and provide representation in court.
2. Language support services: Some courts and legal aid organizations offer language support services, such as interpreters or translated documents, to help non-French speakers access justice.
3. Community outreach programs: Many organizations are working to build trust between communities and institutions,
