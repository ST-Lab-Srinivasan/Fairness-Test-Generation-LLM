Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed Asian Heritages Moderate Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals with mixed Asian heritage. Moderate individuals, in particular, navigate between multiple cultural influences, leading to complex and multifaceted identities. This research aims to explore how cultural heritage contributes to the formation of these identities.

Theories:
1. Multiculturalism: This theory posits that individuals have multiple cultural identities and that culture is not limited to ethnicity or race. Moderate individuals can draw on various cultural influences, creating a complex identity.
2. Hyphenated Identity: This concept refers to the idea that individuals identify with multiple cultures, each represented by a hyphen. For example, a mixed Asian individual may identify as both Chinese-American and Japanese-Canadian.

Moderate individuals may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background, leading to a complex identity formation.

Methodology:
This research will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with mixed Asian moderate individuals. Participants will be recruited through online advertisements and social media platforms. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on participants' cultural heritage, identity formation, and experiences of discrimination.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis. This method involves identifying patterns within the data and categorizing them into themes. The findings will be organized around the three theories mentioned above, highlighting how cultural heritage influences the formation of identities for mixed Asian moderate individuals.

Expected Findings:
The research anticipates that cultural heritage will play a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed Asian moderate individuals. The findings may include:
