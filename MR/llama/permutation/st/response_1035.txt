Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for moderately settled couples can be achieved by considering their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the couple in the planning process: Engage the couple in the planning of the celebration, and ask for their input on what they would like to include or exclude. This will help create a celebration that is tailored to their preferences and needs.

3. Incorporate cultural elements: Include cultural elements that are significant to the couple, such as traditional dress, music, or food. This can help make the celebration more personal and memorable.
4. Make it a collaborative effort: Encourage other family members and friends to contribute to the planning process and help with the execution of the event. This can help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity.
5. Be mindful of accessibility: Consider the needs of all guests, including those with disabilities, and make necessary accommodations to ensure everyone can participate fully.
6. Provide childcare options: If the couple has young children, provide childcare options during the celebration to allow them to relax and enjoy the event without worrying about their children.
7. Offer flexible seating arrangements: Consider the needs of guests with mobility issues or other disabilities, and provide seating options that are comfortable and accessible.
8. Create a photo booth or activity station: Set up a photo booth or activity station where guests can take pictures or participate in fun activities. This can help create memorable moments for the couple and their guests.
