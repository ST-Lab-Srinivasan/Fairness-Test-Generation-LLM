Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals who are experiencing a first trimester pregnancy, particularly those who are not recently single. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care and other health services due to language barriers, lack of insurance coverage, or fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
2. Stress and anxiety: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can take a toll on a person's mental health, particularly during a pregnancy. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues that can affect the mother's ability to care for herself and her baby.
3. Limited social support: Undocumented immigrants may face social isolation due to their immigration status, which can make it difficult for them to build a support network of family and friends. This can be particularly challenging during pregnancy when emotional support is crucial.
4. Financial strain: Pregnancy can be expensive, and undocumented immigrants may face financial barriers in accessing prenatal care, buying healthy foods, and paying for other expenses associated with pregnancy and childbirth.
5. Fear of deportation: The fear of deportation can be a constant source of stress and anxiety for undocumented immigrants, particularly during a pregnancy when they may be more vulnerable to detention and removal.
6. Limited access to resources: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing resources such as food assistance programs, housing support, and other social services that can help them navigate the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood.
7. Stigma and discrimination: The stigma and discrimination associated with being an undocumented immigrant can lead to feelings of shame, isolation, and marginalization, which can affect a person's mental health and ability to access healthcare services.
8. Limited legal options: Undocumented immigrants may face limitations in their legal options during pregnancy, such as being unable to access abortion services
