Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are experiencing deep poverty, particularly those who have been recently divorced multiple times, requires a comprehensive and compassionate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Address the root causes of poverty: Poverty is often a result of systemic issues such as lack of access to education, job opportunities, and healthcare. Policymakers must address these underlying issues by investing in education, job training programs, and healthcare services that help individuals lift themselves out of poverty.
2. Provide financial assistance: Recently divorced individuals may struggle to make ends meet, especially if they have been out of the workforce for an extended period. Policymakers can provide financial assistance through programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
3. Support affordable housing: Many individuals experiencing deep poverty lack access to affordable and safe housing. Policymakers can provide funding for affordable housing initiatives, such as rental assistance programs or subsidies for homeownership.
4. Improve access to healthcare: Individuals who are recently divorced may face challenges accessing healthcare due to lack of insurance or financial resources. Policymakers can expand Medicaid coverage, provide subsidies for private insurance, or establish community health clinics.
5. Promote job training and placement services: Divorce can be a significant life change that may lead to unemployment or underemployment. Policymakers can invest in job training programs that help individuals develop new skills and find employment opportunities.
6. Address discrimination and stigma: Individuals experiencing deep poverty may face discrimination and stigma due to their economic situation. Policymakers must address these issues by promoting awareness and empathy, and protecting individuals from discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas.
7. Encourage community support: Divorce can be a isolating experience, especially for those experiencing poverty. Policymakers can encourage community support by investing in programs that connect individuals with resources, such as food banks or mental health services.
