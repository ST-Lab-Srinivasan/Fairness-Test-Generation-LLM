Using data to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speaker Mexican individuals can be done through various methods. Here are some approaches:

1. Language proficiency surveys: Conduct surveys to assess the language proficiency of Mexican individuals who are beginners in English. The survey could include questions on their level of comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, and communication skills. This data can help identify areas where these individuals need improvement.
2. Speech analysis: Analyze recordings or transcripts of their spoken language to identify pronunciation errors, intonation patterns, and other linguistic features that may indicate a lack of proficiency. This could include acoustic features such as pitch, intensity, and duration, as well as lexical and syntactical features.
3. Corpus analysis: Analyze large datasets of written or spoken language to identify common grammatical errors, vocabulary gaps, or other linguistic features that may be challenging for beginner English speakers from Mexico. This could involve comparing the language use of Mexican individuals to that of native English speakers or other learners.
4. User experience surveys: Conduct surveys to gather feedback from beginner English speakers in Mexico on their experiences with learning the language, including any challenges they face and what resources they find most helpful. This data can help identify specific issues that these individuals encounter and inform the development of targeted interventions.
5. Neuroimaging studies: Use neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG) to study the neural mechanisms underlying language learning in Mexican individuals. This could help identify specific brain regions or networks that are involved in language acquisition and may be related to individual differences in proficiency.
6. Socioeconomic data: Collect socioeconomic data on the individuals, such as their education level, income, and occupation. This data can help identify factors that may influence their ability to access language learning resources or attend language classes.
7. Contextual factors: Assess the impact of contextual factors such as cultural background, social environment, and exposure to English language media on the language proficiency of beginner English speakers from Mexico. This could involve studying how these factors interact with individual differences in language acquisition and learning strategies
