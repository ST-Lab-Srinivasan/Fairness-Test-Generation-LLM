Everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or financial status. Celebrating the cultural contributions of individuals from mixed Asian heritage or any other group should not be done in a way that is exclusionary or marginalizing to others.

Instead, we can focus on promoting inclusivity and diversity by highlighting the unique perspectives and experiences of people from different backgrounds and cultures. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Learn about and appreciate the diverse cultures and histories of Asian communities. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, or engaging in conversations with people from these communities.
2. Support initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in various fields, such as education, media, and business. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and representation of diverse groups.
3. Engage in respectful dialogue and listen to the experiences and perspectives of people from different backgrounds and cultures. This can help to break down barriers and build bridges between communities, fostering greater understanding and empathy.
4. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's race, ethnicity, or wealth. Instead, focus on getting to know individuals as unique people with their own experiences, values, and contributions.
5. Recognize the intersectionality of identity and the ways in which different forms of oppression (such as racism, sexism, and classism) can intersect and affect individuals and communities.
