For beginner Arabic speakers who are also strong right-leaning GOP members, cultural heritage may play a significant role in their identity and worldview. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage might influence their lives:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a particular community or group, which can be an important factor in shaping political beliefs and affiliations. For example, a person who identifies strongly with their Arab heritage may feel more connected to the GOP's platform on issues related to Middle Eastern politics and culture.
2. Cultural values: The cultural values and beliefs of a particular group or community can influence an individual's political views. For instance, Arabic speakers may place a high value on hospitality, respect for elders, and family loyalty, which could inform their political decisions on issues such as immigration, healthcare, and social welfare policies.

For example, the legacy of colonialism, war, or social unrest in the Middle East may influence the political beliefs of Arabic speakers who are also GOP members, leading them to prioritize issues related to national security and foreign policy.

For instance, an Arabic speaker who identifies strongly with their cultural heritage may be more likely to support policies that promote cultural exchange and understanding
