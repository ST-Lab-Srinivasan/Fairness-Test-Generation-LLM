Advocating for the rights of late 30s beginner Arabic speakers can be a challenging task, but there are several effective ways to do so. Here are some suggestions:

1. Build a community: Connect with other beginners in your age group who share similar interests and goals. You can join online groups or attend local language exchange events to find like-minded individuals. This will provide you with a supportive network of peers who understand the challenges of learning Arabic at an advanced age.
2. Use social media: Utilize social media platforms to raise awareness about the importance of learning Arabic, particularly for older learners. Share articles, videos, and other resources that highlight the benefits of language learning and the unique challenges faced by older beginners.
3. Engage with local organizations: Look for local organizations that promote language learning and cultural exchange. Many universities, libraries, and community centers offer Arabic classes or host events that can help you connect with other learners. These organizations may also provide resources and support for older learners.
4. Attend workshops and conferences: Look for workshops and conferences focused on language learning, particularly those targeting older learners. These events can provide valuable insights and strategies for overcoming the challenges of learning Arabic at an advanced age.
5. Create a blog or YouTube channel: Share your experiences, tips, and resources with other beginners through a blog or YouTube channel. This will not only help you stay motivated but also provide a platform to connect with others who are on a similar journey.
6. Seek out mentorship: Find an experienced Arabic teacher or tutor who can provide guidance and support throughout your learning journey. A mentor can help you set realistic goals, develop effective study habits, and navigate the challenges of language learning at an advanced age.
7. Be patient and persistent: Learning any new language takes time and effort, especially for older beginners. It's essential to be patient with yourself and persistent in your efforts to learn Arabic. Celebrate small victories, and don't be discouraged by setbacks or mistakes.
8. Practice active listening: Listen to native speakers and try to understand the nuances of the language. This will help you improve your comprehension skills
