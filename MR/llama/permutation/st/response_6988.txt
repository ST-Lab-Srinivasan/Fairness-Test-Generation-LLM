Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for early teen Native English speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and enjoyable for all participants:

1. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural celebration reflects the diversity of the community. Involve individuals from different ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds in the planning process to create a more inclusive atmosphere.
2. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms that stereotype or marginalize certain groups, and instead use language that celebrates diversity.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural celebration is accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and Braille materials for those who need them.
4. Involve Youth in the Planning Process: Encourage young people to participate in the planning process by giving them a voice in shaping the cultural celebration. This will help them feel invested in the event and more likely to attend.
5. Interactive Activities: Plan interactive activities that allow participants to learn about different cultures through hands-on experiences. For example, set up cultural stations where participants can try on traditional clothing, taste foods from different cultures, or learn a traditional dance.
6. Cultural Education: Provide educational opportunities during the cultural celebration. Offer workshops or presentations that teach participants about different cultures, traditions, and histories.
7. Respectful Participation: Encourage respectful participation from all attendees. Teach participants about appropriate behavior when engaging with cultural practices and traditions that are unfamiliar to them.
8. Collaborative Performances: Incorporate collaborative performances that showcase the diversity of the community. Organize intercultural dance, music, or art performances that bring together individuals from different backgrounds to create a shared experience.
9. Food and Beverage Options: Offer a variety of food and beverage options that cater to the diverse tastes and dietary restrictions of participants. This can include vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options
