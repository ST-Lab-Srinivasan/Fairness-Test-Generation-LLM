There have been several successful advocacy efforts to protect and promote the rights of natural-born Canadian citizen reservists. Here are a few examples:

1. The "Ford Government's Bill 27": In 2019, the Ontario government introduced Bill 27, which aimed to strip the right to vote from Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members serving abroad. This bill was met with widespread criticism and advocacy efforts from reservists and their supporters. The bill was eventually defeated, and the right to vote for CAF members serving abroad was preserved.
2. The "Canadian Armed Forces Voting Rights Act": In 2018, a private member's bill, known as Bill C-317, was introduced in the House of Commons to ensure that Canadian Armed Forces members serving abroad have the right to vote in federal elections. The bill passed third reading and received royal assent in 2019, providing voting rights to reservists serving abroad.
3. The "Reserve Force Voting Act": In 2014, a private member's bill known as Bill C-227 was introduced in the House of Commons to provide voting rights to Canadian Armed Forces members serving abroad. The bill received royal assent in 2015 and became law.
4. Advocacy efforts by military organizations: Several military organizations, such as the Royal Canadian Legion and the Military Families Forum, have advocated for the rights of reservists and their families. These organizations have raised awareness about the challenges faced by reservists and have pushed for policies that support their rights.
5. Court cases: There have been several court cases where reservists have challenged laws or policies that restrict their rights. For example, in 2017, a Canadian Armed Forces member successfully challenged a provision of the Election Act that prevented him from voting in federal elections while serving abroad.
6. Public awareness campaigns: Public awareness campaigns have been launched to educate the public about the challenges faced by reservists and their rights. These campaigns have helped to build support for policies that protect the rights of reservists.
7. Collaboration with government officials: Reservists and their supporters
