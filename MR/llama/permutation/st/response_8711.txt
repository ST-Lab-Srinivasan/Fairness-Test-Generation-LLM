According to the 2019 National Health Care Disparities Report, there are several challenges that employed mixed Hispanic heritage people in the healthcare system may face:

1. Lack of cultural competency training: Many healthcare providers may not have received adequate training on providing culturally competent care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including those with mixed Hispanic heritage.

This can lead to a less than inclusive work environment and affect their overall well-being and job satisfaction.
4. Navigating multiple identities: Employed mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may feel pressure to conform to certain expectations or stereotypes based on their race or ethnicity, which can be challenging when navigating different social and cultural contexts within the healthcare system.

6. Limited career advancement opportunities: Depending on the organization or industry, there may be limited career advancement opportunities for mixed Hispanic heritage healthcare professionals, which can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction with their job.
7. Microaggressions: Employed mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may experience microaggressions, which are subtle, often unintentional verbal or nonverbal behaviors or comments that can be demeaning or offensive. These experiences can add up over time and affect job satisfaction and well-being.
