Art and literature can play a significant role in helping us understand the experiences of nominal Muslims, particularly during their third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some ways in which art and literature can provide insight:

1. Empathy-inducing narratives: Reading literature that depicts the experiences of nominal Muslims during their third trimester of pregnancy can help non-Muslims develop empathy towards them. By putting ourselves in their shoes, we can better understand their struggles and challenges, such as dealing with cultural and societal expectations, managing health concerns, and navigating personal relationships.
