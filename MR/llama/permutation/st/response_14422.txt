Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-middle-income, non-long-time married individuals involves addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by these groups. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge the existence of diverse family structures: Recognize that families come in many forms, including single-parent households, blended families, LGBTQ+ families, and multigenerational households. Ensure policies are inclusive of all family structures.
2. Address economic inequality: Non-upper-middle-income individuals may face financial challenges due to lower incomes or lack of access to resources. Implement policies that address income inequality, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing, and access to education and job training.
3. Provide support for caregivers: Many non-long-time married individuals, particularly women, take on caregiving responsibilities for children, elderly relatives, or both. Offer policies like paid family leave, flexible work arrangements, and respite care to help ease these burdens.
4. Promote access to healthcare: Ensure that all individuals have access to affordable, quality healthcare, regardless of their financial situation or marital status. This includes mental health support, reproductive healthcare, and chronic disease management.
5. Foster community connections: Encourage social connections and a sense of belonging among non-upper-middle-income individuals by investing in community programs, volunteer opportunities, and cultural events. This can help mitigate feelings of isolation or marginalization.
6. Advocate for inclusive education: Ensure that educational policies promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Provide resources to support students from diverse backgrounds, including those from low-income families, single-parent households, or non-traditional family structures.
7. Address discrimination and bias: Identify and challenge any biases or discriminatory practices within social policies and institutions. Ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their marital status or financial situation.
8. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Facilitate opportunities for older generations to learn from younger generations and vice versa. This can help build bridges between different family structures and promote understanding and empathy
