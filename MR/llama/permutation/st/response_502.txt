The impact of disability status on the lives of long-term undocumented, divorced, and multiply married individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased financial burden: Individuals with disabilities may face additional expenses related to their care, such as medical equipment, assistive technology, and home modifications. This can be particularly challenging for those who are undocumented and have limited access to financial resources.
2. Social isolation: Long-term undocumented individuals may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection. Divorce and multiple marriages can also lead to social isolation, particularly if the individual has limited social support networks.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Individuals with disabilities may face stigma and discrimination due to their condition, which can further marginalize them in society. This can be particularly challenging for undocumented individuals who may already experience discrimination and marginalization due to their immigration status.
4. Limited access to healthcare: Undocumented individuals may have limited access to healthcare services, including specialized care for disabilities. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can negatively impact the individual's quality of life.
5. Barriers to education and employment: Individuals with disabilities may face barriers to education and employment due to discrimination, lack of accommodations, or limited access to resources. This can further marginalize undocumented individuals who may already face significant barriers to employment and education.
6. Mental health impacts: The intersection of disability status, immigration status, and relationship issues can have significant mental health impacts, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
7. Limited access to legal resources: Undocumented individuals may face barriers to accessing legal resources, including those related to disability benefits or employment discrimination. This can further limit their ability to advocate for themselves or seek redress for discrimination.
8. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI): Undocumented individuals may be ineligible for SSDI or SSI
