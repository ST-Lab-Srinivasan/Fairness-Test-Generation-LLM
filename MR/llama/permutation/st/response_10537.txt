Supporting the professional aspirations of older adults, particularly those who are no longer able to work due to disability or other reasons, is crucial for their overall well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to support the professional aspirations of not disabled advanced aged individuals (over 85):

1. Volunteer work: Many older adults may still be interested in contributing to society through volunteer work, even if they are no longer able to work full-time. Consider offering your time and skills to organizations that align with their interests and passions.
2. Consulting or advisory roles: Leverage their extensive experience and expertise by inviting them to consult or advise on projects or initiatives that align with their areas of interest. This can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment without requiring them to work full-time.
3. Mentorship programs: Pair them with younger professionals who could benefit from their wisdom, experience, and guidance. This can help older adults feel valued and engaged while also providing a meaningful opportunity for professional growth and development.
4. Remote work arrangements: Consider allowing them to work remotely or flexible hours if they are still interested in working but have limitations that prevent them from commuting or working traditional hours. This can help them maintain their independence and continue contributing to society in a way that works for them.
5. Leveraging technology: Utilize technology to facilitate remote work or collaboration, such as video conferencing tools, instant messaging apps, and cloud-based productivity software. This can help bridge the gap between older adults and digital technologies, enabling them to stay engaged and connected with colleagues and clients.
6. Fostering intergenerational connections: Encourage interactions and collaborations between older adults and younger professionals, students, or community members. This can help bridge the generation gap and create opportunities for mutual learning and growth.
7. Supporting lifelong learning: Provide resources and support for older adults to continue learning and developing new skills, such as online courses, workshops, or training programs. This can help them stay engaged and mentally active, while also contributing to their personal growth and development.
8. Offering career transition support: Provide guidance and support for older adults who
