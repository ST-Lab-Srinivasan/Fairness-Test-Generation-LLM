Creating more inclusive community events for expecting masculine people requires understanding and acknowledging the unique needs and experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions to help create a more welcoming and inclusive environment:

1. Inclusive language and marketing: Use language and marketing materials that are inclusive and respectful of all genders. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" or "women") and instead use gender-neutral terms like "everyone," "all," or "community."
2. Accessibility and accommodations: Ensure that your event is accessible to people of all abilities by providing wheelchair access, gender-neutral restrooms, and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees. Offer accommodations like ASL interpretation or communication support for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Gender-neutral programming: Plan activities and workshops that are inclusive of all genders and avoid binary gender stereotypes. For example, instead of having a "men's only" workshop, offer a workshop titled "Self-Care for All Genders."
4. Safe space policy: Establish a safe space policy that is clear and visible to attendees. This can include having a designated safe space area or providing information on how to access one if needed. Ensure that your event staff are trained in de-escalation techniques and know how to handle conflicts related to gender identity.
5. Partner with LGBTQ+ organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations to help promote your event and ensure that it is inclusive of all genders. These organizations can also provide valuable input on how to make your event more inclusive.
6. Education and training: Provide education and training for event staff and volunteers on topics like gender diversity, inclusion, and respectful communication. This can help create a more welcoming environment for expecting masculine people.
7. Involve the community: Engage with the local LGBTQ+ community in the planning process to ensure that your event is responsive to their needs and concerns. Encourage feedback and suggestions from attendees and use this information to make improvements for future events.
8. Focus on inclusive entertainment: Choose entertainment
