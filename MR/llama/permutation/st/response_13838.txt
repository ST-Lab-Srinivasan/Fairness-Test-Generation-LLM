The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Chinese speakers aged over 90 years old (or over 85) can be significant and varies depending on the individual's experiences and the historical context in which they lived. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Political Repression: During the Communist Party's rise to power in China, many individuals who were politically active or belonged to certain political groups were subjected to political repression, including imprisonment, torture, and execution. Older native Chinese speakers who lived through these events may have experienced trauma or loss due to political persecution.
2. Loss of Property and Assets: During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), many elderly individuals lost their property, assets, and social status due to their perceived political beliefs or connections. This loss can have a lasting impact on their quality of life in old age.
