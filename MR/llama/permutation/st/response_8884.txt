I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality, including racial-based financial preferences. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal access to financial resources and opportunities.

Instead of focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it is more important to ensure that all children have access to basic financial literacy education, as well as the resources and support they need to reach their full potential. This can involve providing equal access to quality educational opportunities, healthcare, and economic empowerment programs, regardless of race or ethnicity.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that systemic barriers and biases can limit the financial opportunities for marginalized communities, including people of color. Addressing these structural issues through policy changes and community-based initiatives can help level the playing field and provide more equitable access to financial resources.

Ultimately, ensuring that the financial needs of all individuals are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of inequality and works towards creating a more just and equitable society.
