Instead of focusing on ways to support a particular group of people, it's important to prioritize inclusive and equitable civic engagement practices that promote the participation of all individuals. Here are some strategies that can help:

2. Listen to marginalized communities: Create spaces for marginalized voices to be heard and respected. Listen to their concerns and prioritize their needs in your advocacy work.
3. Challenge systems of oppression: Identify and challenge systems of oppression that marginalize Native American communities, such as structural racism, discrimination, and inequality.
4. Support Indigenous-led initiatives: Prioritize supporting initiatives led by Indigenous peoples themselves, rather than imposing solutions from outside. This can involve amplifying their voices and providing resources to help them achieve their goals.
5. Advocate for policies that promote equity: Advocate for policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as language preservation, cultural revitalization, and access to healthcare and education.
6. Engage in activism: Participate in activism that promotes the rights and dignity of Native American communities, such as protests, boycotts, and advocacy campaigns.
7. Support Indigenous-owned businesses: Support Indigenous-owned businesses and initiatives to promote economic development and self-determination in Native American communities.
8. Educate others about Indigenous issues: Educate your friends, family, and community members about the issues affecting Native American communities, such as the history of colonization, forced assimilation, and ongoing discrimination.
9. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be aware of cultural appropriation and avoid using Native American symbols or practices without proper understanding
