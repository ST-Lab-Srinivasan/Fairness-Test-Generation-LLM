Protecting the legal rights of recently divorced active-duty individuals is crucial to ensure their well-being and financial security, particularly when it comes to issues related to military benefits and property division. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a military lawyer or legal aid organization to understand the specific laws and regulations that apply to your situation. They can help you navigate the complexities of military divorce and ensure that your rights are protected.
2. Know Your Benefits: Understand the military benefits available to you, including retirement pay, healthcare, and education benefits. This knowledge will help you negotiate a fair property settlement or spousal support arrangement.
3. Document Everything: Keep detailed records of all financial transactions, property purchases, and other important documents related to your marriage and divorce. This documentation can help prove your claims in court and ensure that you receive the benefits you are entitled to.
4. Protect Your Credit: Monitor your credit report and address any issues promptly to prevent identity theft or financial exploitation during your divorce. Consider freezing your credit reports to prevent unauthorized access.
5. Obtain a Military Order: If you have children, obtain a military order for child custody and visitation rights. This can help protect your parental rights and ensure that your children are well-cared for during and after your divorce.
6. Seek Temporary Support: If you are facing financial hardship due to the divorce, seek temporary support from your spouse or the military. This can help you cover essential expenses while you wait for a final decision on property division and spousal support.
7. Be Prepared for Changes: As an active-duty service member, your divorce may impact your benefits and military status. Be prepared to address any changes in your situation and seek legal advice if necessary.
8. Consider Mediation: If you and your spouse are amicable, consider using mediation services to resolve disputes related to property division, spousal support, and child custody. This can be a faster and less expensive alternative to going to court.
9. Build a Support Network: Surround yourself with friends, family, or a therapist who can provide emotional support
