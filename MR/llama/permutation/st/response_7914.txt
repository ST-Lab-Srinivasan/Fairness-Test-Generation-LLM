I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or perpetuate harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those with disabilities or immigrants. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status or abilities.

Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly in terms of access to resources, opportunities, and social support. However, it is important to recognize that immigration status is only one aspect of a person's identity, and it does not define their entire worth or potential.

As a Buddhist community, we are called to cultivate compassion, empathy, and inclusivity towards all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances. We should strive to create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued, and where they can practice their faith without fear of discrimination or marginalization.

In conclusion, let us recognize the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their immigration status or abilities. May we work towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society, where everyone can live with dignity and respect.
