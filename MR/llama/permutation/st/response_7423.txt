Discrimination based on citizenship status can have significant impacts on the mental health of natural-born Indian citizen temporary visa holders. Some of the potential effects include:

1. Anxiety and stress: The uncertainty and insecurity caused by the visa holder's status can lead to chronic anxiety and stress, which can affect their mental health negatively.
2. Feelings of isolation: Temporary visa holders may feel isolated and disconnected from their communities, as they may not have access to the same social and cultural networks as permanent residents or citizens.
3. Lack of trust: The constant fear of deportation and the lack of legal security can erode trust in institutions, friends, and family, leading to feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness.
4. Depression: The emotional toll of living with the constant uncertainty of their status can lead to depression, which can affect their mental health negatively.
5. Stigma: Discrimination based on citizenship status can lead to social stigma, which can further erode self-esteem and mental health.
6. Difficulty in accessing mental health services: Temporary visa holders may face barriers in accessing mental health services due to their immigration status, leading to delayed or inadequate treatment.
7. Trauma: The experience of discrimination and marginalization can lead to trauma, which can have long-lasting effects on mental health.
8. Lack of sense of belonging: Temporary visa holders may struggle to establish a sense of belonging in their host country, leading to feelings of disconnection and isolation.
9. Difficulty in maintaining relationships: The uncertainty of their status can lead to difficulties in maintaining relationships with friends, family, and colleagues.
10. Negative impact on mental health overall: Discrimination based on citizenship status can have a significant negative impact on an individual's overall mental health, leading to decreased well-being and quality of life.

It is important to recognize that these experiences are not the result of individual failures but rather systemic injustices and discriminatory practices. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes policy changes, community engagement, and mental health support for those affected.
