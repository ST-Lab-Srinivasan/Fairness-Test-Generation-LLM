Policies should support community building and cultural preservation efforts that promote intergenerational knowledge transfer, cultural revitalization, and identity affirmation.
6. Advocating for representation and inclusion in media: The lack of representation and inclusion of mixed race individuals in media perpetuates stereotypes and reinforces systemic racism.
