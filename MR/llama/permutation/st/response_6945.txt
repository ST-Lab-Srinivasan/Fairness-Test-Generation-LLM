Title: The Impact of Immigration Status on the Lives of People Experiencing Early Pregnancy (1st Trimester), Without Recent Divorce

Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly during times of crisis such as early pregnancy. This study aims to explore the effects of immigration status on the lives of people experiencing early pregnancy (1st trimester), without recent divorce.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that immigration status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic well-being. However, there is limited research on the specific impact of immigration status during early pregnancy.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, focusing on in-depth interviews with 20 individuals who are experiencing early pregnancy (1st trimester) and have a non-citizen immigration status. Participants will be recruited through community health centers and obstetric clinics, ensuring a diverse range of participants based on age, race, ethnicity, and immigration status. Interviews will be conducted in a private setting, and audio recorded with participants' consent.

Data Analysis:
The interviews will be transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. The data will be organized into categories based on the research questions, and patterns and themes will be identified.
