Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for masculine mentally disabled individuals requires thoughtful planning and execution. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite men with mental disabilities to participate in the planning of cultural events, such as festivals or parties. This will give them a sense of ownership and agency over the event, making it more meaningful and enjoyable for them.

3. Offer sensory-friendly activities: Some cultural events can be overwhelming for individuals with mental disabilities due to loud noises, crowded spaces, or flashing lights.
