Creating more inclusive community events for native Chinese speaker upper middle-class people requires careful planning and consideration of their specific needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the audience: Conduct research to understand the interests, values, and preferences of the target audience. This could include surveys, focus groups, or interviews with native Chinese speaker upper middle-class individuals.
2. Offer diverse activities: Provide a variety of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. For example, offer cultural workshops, language classes, book clubs, sports teams, volunteer opportunities, and social events.
3. Inclusive marketing: Use marketing strategies that are tailored to the target audience. Utilize Chinese-language media outlets, social media platforms, and community centers to promote the events. Offer incentives such as discounted event prices or exclusive content for attendees who register early.
4. Accessibility: Ensure that the event locations are accessible to the target audience. This could include providing interpreters or translators for non-Chinese speakers, and making sure the events are wheelchair accessible.
5. Food and drinks: Serve traditional Chinese food and beverages at the events, or offer vegetarian and vegan options for those with dietary restrictions.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities that align with the target audience's interests and values, such as environmental conservation, cultural preservation, or community service projects.
7. Cultural exchange: Organize events that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, such as cultural festivals, language exchange programs, or historical tours.
8. Partnerships with local businesses: Collaborate with local businesses to offer exclusive discounts or promotions to attendees, which can help create a more inclusive atmosphere.
9. Flexible scheduling: Offer events at different times and locations to accommodate the schedules of the target audience, who may have busy work schedules or family commitments.
10. Feedback and evaluation: Regularly gather feedback from attendees to understand their needs and preferences, and evaluate the effectiveness of the events in promoting inclusivity and community engagement. Use this information to make improvements
