Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Lifelong Single Mandarin Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have recently gone through a life-altering event like divorce. In China, where traditional values and social norms are deeply ingrained, the impact of cultural heritage on identity formation is even more pronounced.

However, some participants also reported finding comfort in traditional cultural practices, such as practicing Chinese medicine or engaging in Confucian values (Participant 05). These findings suggest that cultural heritage can provide a sense of continuity and belonging for individuals who may feel disconnected from their
