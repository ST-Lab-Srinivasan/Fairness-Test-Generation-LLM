Addressing the specific needs of Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, cultural backgrounds, and educational goals. Here are some strategies to address their needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching practices: Train educators on culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge the importance of Native culture, traditions, and values in the classroom. This can help create a more inclusive learning environment for ex-spouses who may feel marginalized or disconnected from mainstream education.
2. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives into curricula and course materials to better reflect the experiences and worldviews of Native students. This can help ex-spouses feel more connected to their educational journey and appreciate the value of their cultural heritage.
3. Support networks: Establish support networks specifically for Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses, such as mentorship programs or peer support groups. These networks can provide a safe space for individuals to share experiences, receive advice, and build connections with others who understand their unique challenges.
4. Targeted financial aid: Provide targeted financial aid to Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses to help address the economic disparities they may face. This can include scholarships, grants, or other forms of financial support specifically designed for this population.
5. Access to cultural resources: Ensure that educational institutions have access to cultural resources and materials that reflect Native cultures and histories. This can include traditional art, literature, music, and other cultural expressions that can enrich the learning experience for ex-spouses.
6. Community partnerships: Foster partnerships between educational institutions and Native communities to provide opportunities for ex-spouses to engage in experiential learning, internships, or volunteer work that connects them with their cultural heritage. These experiences can help individuals develop a sense of purpose and identity tied to their Native culture.
7. Identity-based programming: Develop programs that explicitly address the unique needs and challenges faced by Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses. This can include workshops, seminars, or other forms of programming that focus on issues such as cultural preservation, identity formation, and community building.
