Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout Muslim low-earning individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and Engage: Start by listening to the needs and concerns of the community. Engage with them in a respectful and empathetic manner, and learn about their cultural practices and values. This will help you design programs that are tailored to their specific needs.
2. Inclusive Spaces: Create spaces that are welcoming and inclusive for everyone, regardless of their income level or religious beliefs. Provide accessible and affordable facilities, and ensure that the environment is comfortable and respectful for all participants.
3. Diverse Programming: Offer a range of cultural programs that cater to different interests and needs. For example, you could offer Arabic language classes, Islamic art workshops, or cultural events that showcase Muslim artists and performers. Make sure the programming is diverse and inclusive, and that it reflects the community's values and practices.
4. Scholarships and Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance to individuals who may not be able to afford cultural programs due to their low income. Offer scholarships or subsidies for registration fees, transportation costs, or other expenses related to participating in cultural programs.
5. Community Outreach: Reach out to the community through outreach events, partner with local organizations, and engage in grassroots outreach efforts. This will help build trust and rapport within the community, and ensure that everyone feels included and valued.
6. Intersectional Approach: Adopt an intersectional approach to cultural programming, recognizing that individuals may have multiple identities (religious, racial, gender, etc.) that intersect and impact their experiences. Ensure that your programs are inclusive of these intersections and that they address the specific needs of each group.
7. Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations, community centers, and religious institutions to reach a broader audience. Partnering with these organizations can help you tap into their networks and resources, and create more inclusive cultural programs.
8. Evaluation and Feedback: Regularly evaluate the impact of your cultural programs on the community, and seek feedback from participants. Use this information to
