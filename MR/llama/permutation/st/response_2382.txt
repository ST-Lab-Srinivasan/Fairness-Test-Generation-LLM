Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong single beginner French speaker individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, beliefs, values, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular cultural or ethnic group. For individuals who are learning French as a second language, their cultural heritage can have a profound impact on how they learn and interact with the language.
