Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Long-Term Widowed Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have experienced significant life events such as widowhood. In this study, we examine the cultural heritage of long-term widowed individuals and its impact on their identities. We specifically focus on native French speakers who have been widowed for an extended period to gain a deeper understanding of how cultural heritage influences their sense of self.

Theory:
Our study draws upon the social constructivist theory, which posits that individuals' identities are constructed through interactions with their environment and the people around them. Cultural heritage is a significant aspect of this environment, as it provides a framework for understanding oneself and one's place in society. Through cultural practices, traditions, and values, individuals learn to navigate their social roles and relationships, which in turn shape their identities.

Methodology:
We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 long-term widowed native French speakers, aged 50-75 years old. Participants were recruited through local community centers and support groups for widows. The interviews were conducted in a comfortable and private setting, and were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Findings:
Our analysis revealed several key themes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of long-term widowed individuals. Firstly, participants emphasized the importance of cultural practices and traditions in providing a sense of comfort and familiarity during times of loss. For example, one participant shared how she found solace in cooking traditional dishes for her family and friends after her husband passed away. Secondly, we found that cultural heritage influenced how participants understood and navigated their social roles and relationships. For instance, some participants reported feeling pressure to maintain a certain image or reputation within their community, based on traditional gender roles and expectations. Finally, we observed that cultural heritage could also shape participants' experiences of grief and mourning. For example, one participant discussed how her cultural beliefs about the afterlife influenced her sense of closure after her husband's death.
