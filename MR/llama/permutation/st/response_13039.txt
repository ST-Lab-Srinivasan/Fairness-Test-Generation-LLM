Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identity Among Recently Single Native Arabic Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those who have recently experienced significant life changes such as divorce or widowhood. In the case of native Arabic speakers, cultural heritage can greatly influence their sense of self and belonging. This paper will examine the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently single native Arabic speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity by providing a sense of belonging and shared values (Hall, 1990). For example, in collectivist cultures such as those found in the Middle East, family and community ties are highly valued, which can impact an individual's sense of self and purpose (Hofstede, 1980). However, recent studies have also highlighted the importance of individualism in shaping identity, particularly among younger generations (Taylor & Kendall, 2007).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with recently single native Arabic speakers. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a detailed analysis of the participants' experiences and perspectives.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently single native Arabic speaker individuals. Participants reported feeling a strong sense of loyalty and obligation to their family and community, which can impact their identity formation and sense of belonging. For example, one participant stated: "I feel like I'm stuck between two worlds â€“ my own personal identity and the expectations of my family and community" (Participant 1, Age 35).

Conclusion:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently single native Arabic speaker individuals. The findings suggest that participants feel a strong sense of loyalty and obligation to their family and community, which can impact their identity formation and sense of belonging. Future research
