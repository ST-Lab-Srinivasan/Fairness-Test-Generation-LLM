Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper middle-income and non-recently divorced individuals requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Identify and address systemic barriers: Social policies should be designed to address the root causes of inequality, such as discrimination, unequal access to education and job opportunities, and limited social mobility. Policymakers must identify these barriers and develop strategies to overcome them.
2. Inclusive data collection: Collecting data on socioeconomic status, income, and access to resources can help policymakers understand the needs of non-upper middle-income individuals. This data should be disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and other relevant factors to ensure that policies are tailored to different groups' needs.
3. Increase access to affordable housing: Many non-upper middle-income individuals face challenges in accessing affordable and safe housing. Policymakers can address this issue by investing in affordable housing programs, subsidies, and tax credits for low-income families and individuals.
4. Improve access to quality education: Ensuring that all individuals have access to quality education is crucial for social mobility. Policymakers can implement policies such as universal pre-kindergarten, increased funding for public schools in low-income areas, and financial aid programs for college students from low-income backgrounds.
5. Enhance job training and placement services: Non-upper middle-income individuals may face challenges in finding well-paying jobs due to a lack of job skills or connections. Policymakers can invest in job training programs, including vocational training, apprenticeships, and on-the-job training.
6. Strengthen social safety nets: Social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance, food assistance programs, and Medicaid, are essential for protecting individuals from poverty and financial insecurity. Policymakers can expand these programs to reach more people and provide additional support during times of economic downturn.
