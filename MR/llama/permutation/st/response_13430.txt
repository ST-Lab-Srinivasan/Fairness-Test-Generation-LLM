As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the term "mid-50s" is not a legally recognized age category in the United States. The legal system recognizes individuals based on their age, gender, race, ethnicity, and other personal characteristics. However, I understand your question to be asking about the challenges faced by Native American citizens in the legal system.

Native Americans face significant challenges within the legal system in the United States. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding: The legal system is often not tailored to address the unique needs and experiences of Native American communities. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and a lack of empathy for the cultural practices and beliefs of Native Americans.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Many Native American communities face barriers to accessing legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and assert their rights.
3. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has had a profound impact on the legal system's relationship with Native American communities. Many Native Americans have experienced historical trauma, which can affect their trust in the legal system and their ability to access justice.
4. Discrimination: Native Americans may face discrimination within the legal system, including racial profiling and stereotyping. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of fairness in the application of justice.
5. Lack of representation: Many Native American communities have limited access to legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and assert their rights.
6. Jurisdictional issues: The legal system in the United States is complex, with many different levels of jurisdiction and authority. This can lead to confusion and conflict when dealing with Native American communities, particularly those who are located on reservations or other tribal lands.
7. Sovereign immunity: Many Native American tribes have sovereign immunity, which means that they are not subject to suit in state or federal court without their consent. This can make it difficult for individuals to access the legal system and assert their rights against a tribe or tribal entity.
8. Limited authority
