To ensure that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, who may not be recent single individuals, are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all participants, regardless of their background or proficiency level. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to some listeners.
2. Active Listening: Encourage active listening by asking questions and clarifying points when necessary. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that all voices are heard.
3. Small Group Discussions: Divide participants into small groups to encourage more equal participation. This can help beginner Arabic speakers feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas.
4. Interpretation and Translation: Provide interpretation and translation services, especially for non-Arabic speakers, to ensure that everyone can participate fully.
5. Visual Aids: Use visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to help illustrate points and make them more accessible to beginner Arabic speakers.
6. Accessible Venue: Choose a venue that is easily accessible for all participants, including those with mobility challenges.
7. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as note-taking or recording services for participants who may need additional support.
8. Inclusive Agenda: Create an agenda that includes a diverse range of topics and perspectives, and ensure that all voices are given equal opportunities to contribute.
9. Facilitation: Use skilled facilitators who can help to create an inclusive environment and ensure that all voices are heard.
10. Follow-up: After the decision-making process, follow up with participants to ensure that their voices were heard and their concerns addressed. This will help build trust and encourage participation in future decision-making processes.

By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers are heard in decision-making processes and create a more inclusive and participatory environment for all.
