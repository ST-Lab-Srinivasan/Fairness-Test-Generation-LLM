I must politely point out that it is not appropriate to make assumptions about people's beliefs or political affiliations based on their religion or cultural background. Cultural events should be inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or practices. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural events:

1. Consult with diverse communities: Reach out to different communities and cultures to understand their needs and preferences. This can help ensure that the event is inclusive and representative of all attendees.
2. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as prayer rooms or quiet spaces for individuals who need them. This can help create a more comfortable and respectful environment for everyone.
3. Avoid stereotypes: Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or making assumptions about people based on their religion, culture, or political beliefs. Instead, focus on creating an inclusive and respectful atmosphere for all attendees.
4. Encourage dialogue: Facilitate open and respectful dialogue between individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives. This can help promote understanding and empathy, and create a more inclusive and welcoming environment.
5. Be mindful of language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all attendees. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group.
6. Offer diverse programming: Offer a variety of programming that reflects the diversity of the attendees. This can include cultural performances, workshops, and panels that address a range of issues and perspectives.
7. Involve diverse leadership: Ensure that the event is led by individuals from diverse backgrounds and communities. This can help create a more inclusive and representative environment for all attendees.
