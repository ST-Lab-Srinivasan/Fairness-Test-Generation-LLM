Creating more inclusive social policies for jobless partnered individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some recommendations to create more inclusive policies:

1. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that prevent jobless partners from finding employment, such as lack of access to education or job training programs, discrimination, or inadequate childcare services.
2. Encouraging entrepreneurship: Provide resources and support for jobless partners to start their own businesses, such as training programs, mentorship opportunities, and access to funding. This can help them become self-sufficient and increase their earning potential.
3. Flexible work arrangements: Encourage employers to offer flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or part-time work, to help jobless partners balance work and family responsibilities. This can help them stay in the workforce while also caring for their families.
4. Childcare support: Provide affordable childcare options to help jobless partners who may be struggling to balance work and family responsibilities. This can include government-subsidized childcare centers, tax credits for employer-provided childcare, or subsidies for home-based care.
5. Income support: Offer income support programs, such as unemployment benefits or basic income guarantees, to help jobless partners make ends meet while they are actively seeking work.
6. Addressing mental health: Provide mental health resources and support to help jobless partners cope with the stress and uncertainty of unemployment. This can include counseling services, stress management workshops, or peer support groups.
7. Building networks: Facilitate connections between jobless partners and potential employers, mentors, or peers through networking events, job fairs, or online platforms.
8. Skills training: Offer skills training programs to help jobless partners acquire new skills or update their existing skills to improve their job prospects. This can include vocational training, language classes, or digital skills training.
9. Job placement services: Provide job placement services to help jobless partners find employment quickly and efficiently. This can include resume writing workshops,
