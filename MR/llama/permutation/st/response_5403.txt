Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers aged over 90 years old (or advanced over 85 years old) requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this age group:

1. Offer a variety of activities: Include a range of activities that cater to different interests and abilities, such as language classes, cultural workshops, and social events. This will ensure that there is something for everyone to participate in and enjoy.
2. Use simple language and visual aids: When communicating with older adults, it's important to use simple language and visual aids to help them follow along. Avoid using complex grammar or vocabulary that may be difficult for them to understand.
3. Provide plenty of opportunities for socialization: Older adults often value social interaction and the opportunity to connect with others. Make sure there are plenty of opportunities for them to meet new people and make friends, such as through group activities or social events.
4. Create a comfortable and supportive environment: Ensure that the event space is comfortable and supportive for older adults. This may include providing seating, using bright lighting, and ensuring that there are no distractions or obstacles that could hinder their participation.
5. Use technology strategically: While technology can be a great tool for connecting people, it's important to use it in a way that is accessible and easy to use for older adults. Consider using large buttons, clear displays, and simple navigation to help them interact with the event.
6. Offer assistance and support: Make sure there are staff or volunteers available to provide assistance and support to older adults as needed. This may include helping them navigate the event space, providing translation services, or simply being available to answer questions or offer encouragement.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the older adults attending the event. Celebrate their cultural heritage and life experiences, and create opportunities for them to share their stories and connect with others.
8. Provide transportation options: Many older adults may have difficulty getting to events due to mobility issues or lack of access to transportation. Consider providing transportation options, such as shuttle buses or car
