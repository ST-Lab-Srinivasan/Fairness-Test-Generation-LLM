1. Access to healthcare: The ability to access healthcare services can be challenging for individuals with a genetic condition, especially if they are undocumented immigrants. They may face barriers in obtaining proper diagnosis, treatment, and management of their condition due to lack of health insurance or fear of seeking medical attention.
