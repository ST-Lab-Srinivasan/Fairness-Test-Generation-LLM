Introduction:

Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of Native American and recent immigrants to the United States, particularly those who are transitioning or have already undergone transition. These individuals may face unique challenges related to their gender identity, expression, and overall well-being. This paper will explore the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of Native American and recent immigrant transgender people post-transition.

Impact of Genetic Conditions on Native American Transgender People:

Native American communities have historically faced discrimination, marginalization, and violence, which can lead to higher rates of mental health issues, substance abuse, and suicide. For transgender individuals in these communities, the added burden of genetic conditions can further exacerbate these challenges. Some common genetic conditions affecting Native American transgender people include:

1. X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH): This condition affects the body's ability to absorb phosphorus, leading to weak bones and joint pain. XLH can also cause mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, which may be more challenging for transgender individuals to navigate due to societal stigma and discrimination.
2. Turner Syndrome: This condition affects female development and can result in shorter stature, delayed sexual development, and learning disabilities. Transgender individuals with Turner Syndrome may face additional challenges related to their gender identity and expression, as they may experience stigma and discrimination based on their gender status.
3. Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS): AIS is a genetic condition in which the body's cells are resistant to androgens, such as testosterone. This can result in a range of physical characteristics, including short stature, breast tissue, and a lack of facial hair. Transgender individuals with AIS may face unique challenges related to their gender identity and expression, particularly if they do not conform to societal expectations of male or female presentation.

Impact of Genetic Conditions on Recent Immigrant Transgender People:

Recent immigrants to the United States may also face a range of challenges related to genetic conditions, including those that affect their gender identity
