I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to promote cultural preservation or exclusion based on sexual orientation. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, are entitled to respect, dignity, and equal rights. Discrimination or marginalization of any group is not acceptable and goes against the principles of inclusivity and diversity.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote cross-cultural understanding, mutual respect, and inclusivity between different communities, including Native American and LGBTQ+ communities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the history, culture, and traditions of both communities. This will help you understand their perspectives and values, which is essential for building bridges of understanding.
2. Listen actively: Attend events, workshops, or cultural gatherings organized by both communities. Listen to their experiences, challenges, and successes. Show your support by being an active listener.
3. Promote dialogue: Facilitate open and respectful dialogues between members of both communities. Encourage them to share their stories, traditions, and cultural practices with each other.
4. Support community initiatives: Identify initiatives or projects that bring together members of both communities. Offer your support in any way you can, whether it's through volunteering, donating, or spreading the word about these initiatives.
5. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with local organizations and policymakers to promote inclusive policies that recognize the value of diversity and cultural preservation. Encourage the recognition of Native American and LGBTQ+ rights as human rights.
6. Create safe spaces: Collaborate with community leaders to create safe and inclusive spaces where members of both communities can gather, share their experiences, and build relationships.
7. Celebrate cultural diversity: Organize events that celebrate the cultural diversity of both communities. Encourage intercultural exchange and mutual appreciation.
8. Support youth initiatives: Many Native American and LGBTQ+ youth face unique challenges and discrimination. Offer support to local organizations that provide resources, mentorship, and advocacy for these young people.
