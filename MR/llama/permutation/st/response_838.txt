Lifelong single permanent residents (LPRs) face unique challenges in the legal system compared to citizens and naturalized citizens. Here are some of the challenges LPRs may encounter:

1. Lack of pathway to citizenship: LPRs have a pathway to citizenship, but it can be complex and time-consuming. They must meet certain eligibility requirements, pass background checks, and wait for years before they can apply for citizenship.
