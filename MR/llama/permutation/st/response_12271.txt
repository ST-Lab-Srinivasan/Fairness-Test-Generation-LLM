Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Beginner Chinese Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who are beginners in learning a new language like Chinese. As a beginner Chinese speaker, one's cultural heritage can influence their motivation, learning strategies, and perceptions of the language. This paper aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of beginner Chinese speakers and how it affects their language learning journey.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural background influences language learning motivation (Bernardini, 2014) and strategies (Kim, 2013). For instance, individuals from collectivist cultures tend to value group harmony over individualism, which can impact their willingness to take risks in language learning (Han, 2018). Similarly, those from high-context cultures may rely more heavily on implicit learning strategies due to their preference for indirect communication styles (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988). Beginner Chinese speakers who are also immigrants may experience additional challenges related to cultural identity and language acquisition due to the complex interplay between their pre-existing cultural beliefs and practices, as well as their exposure to a new linguistic and cultural environment (Kim, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach using in-depth interviews with beginner Chinese speakers who are also immigrants. Participants will be recruited through online language learning communities and social media platforms. The interview protocol will include questions related to participants' cultural background, language learning experiences, and perceived challenges. Data will be analyzed thematically, focusing on the intersections between cultural heritage and language learning.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of how cultural heritage shapes the identities of beginner Chinese speakers. The findings can inform language teaching pedagogies and strategies tailored to individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. By recognizing the interplay between culture and language learning, educators can better support immigrant learners in their pursuit of
