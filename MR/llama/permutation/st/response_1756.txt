I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic-based mentorship. Mentorship should be based on individual merit and potential for growth, rather than race or ethnicity. The development of "ethnically full Asian progressive people" is not a valid or inclusive goal, as it reinforces harmful racial categories and stereotypes.

Instead, mentorship should focus on supporting individuals in their personal and professional growth, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This can involve providing guidance, support, and resources to help individuals achieve their goals and reach their full potential. Mentorship programs that prioritize diversity and inclusion can help to break down barriers and create more equitable opportunities for all individuals.

It's important to recognize that mentorship is not a panacea for addressing the systemic inequalities and discrimination faced by marginalized communities, including Asian Americans. However, it can be a valuable tool for promoting representation and inclusion in leadership positions and other areas of society. By prioritizing diversity and inclusivity in mentorship programs, we can help to create a more equitable and just society for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
