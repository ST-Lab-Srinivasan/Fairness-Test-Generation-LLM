The challenges faced by advanced Arabic speakers over the age of 90 or beginners in the healthcare system may include:

1. Language Barriers: Older Arabic speakers may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers due to language barriers, particularly if they are not fluent in the local language or dialect. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and delayed treatments.
