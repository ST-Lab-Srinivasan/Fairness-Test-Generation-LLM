As a disaster response professional, it is important to recognize that recent divorcees, especially those who have gone through multiple divorces and are identifying as extreme or multiple times extreme moderate liberal individuals, may have unique needs during a disaster response. Here are some strategies to address these needs:

1. Cultural sensitivity and respect: Recognize the cultural diversity of this group and ensure that all responses are culturally sensitive and respectful. This includes using language and messaging that is inclusive and non-judgmental, and involving diverse representatives from the community in decision-making processes.
2. Inclusive communication: Ensure that communication channels are accessible and inclusive for all individuals, including those with disabilities or limited mobility. Provide multilingual support and use plain language to ensure that everyone can understand the information being shared.
3. Accommodation of diverse needs: Recognize that recent divorcees may have unique needs related to their living situation, such as temporary housing or access to essential items like food and clothing. Ensure that these needs are addressed in a timely and respectful manner.
4. Flexibility and adaptability: Be prepared to adapt response strategies based on the evolving needs of the community, particularly those who may be experiencing unique challenges during the disaster response.
5. Community-based approaches: Involve local community leaders and organizations in disaster response efforts to ensure that the response is tailored to the specific needs of the community. This can help build trust and buy-in among recent divorcees, who may be more likely to feel supported and empowered through community-based approaches.
6. Emotional support: Recognize that disaster response can have a significant emotional impact on individuals, particularly those who have experienced multiple divorces. Provide emotional support services, such as counseling or peer support groups, to help individuals cope with the stress and trauma of the disaster.
7. Advocacy and policy changes: Work with local advocacy groups and policymakers to address systemic issues that may be impacting recent divorcees, such as lack of affordable housing or inadequate social support systems. This can help create a more resilient and supportive community for all individuals, including those who have experienced multiple divorces.
