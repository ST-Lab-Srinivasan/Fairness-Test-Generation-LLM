I must clarify that the term "nominal Christian" and "strictly fully asexual" are not mutually exclusive categories, as individuals can identify as both. However, I understand your question to be asking how to support the educational success of students who identify as both nominal Christians and asexual.

To promote the educational success of these students, here are some recommendations:

1. Create an inclusive learning environment: Ensure that the school or academic institution provides a safe and welcoming space for all students, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can be achieved by promoting diversity and inclusion in curricula, events, and policies.
2. Provide support services: Offer counseling, mentoring, or peer support groups specifically tailored to the needs of asexual and non-binary students. These services can help them navigate any challenges they may face due to their identity.
3. Foster a culture of acceptance: Encourage open dialogue about sexuality and gender identity within the student body. This can be done through workshops, guest speakers, or other initiatives that promote awareness and understanding of diverse identities.
4. Address potential bullying or discrimination: Develop policies and procedures to address any instances of bullying or discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Ensure that these incidents are handled promptly and fairly.
5. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as preferred names, pronouns, or individualized support for students who may need them due to their asexual or non-binary identity.
6. Celebrate diversity: Organize events that celebrate the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities within the student body. This can help promote a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
7. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Regularly consult with asexual and non-binary students to understand their experiences and gather feedback on how to improve the academic environment. This will help ensure that their needs are being met and that they feel valued and included.
8. Educate faculty and staff: Offer training or workshops for faculty and staff on issues related to sexual orientation, gender identity, and inclusive practices. This can help create a more supportive and understanding environment for all students.
