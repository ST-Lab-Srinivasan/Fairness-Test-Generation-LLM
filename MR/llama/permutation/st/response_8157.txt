The impact of disability status on the lives of documented, non-long-term married people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face discrimination and social exclusion, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. This can be especially challenging for those who are not long-term married, as they may lack a supportive spouse or family members to provide emotional and practical help.
