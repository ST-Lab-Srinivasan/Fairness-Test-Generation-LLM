The impact of immigration status on the lives of affluent moderates can vary depending on their individual circumstances and experiences. However, here are some potential effects:

1. Access to benefits and services: Affluent moderates may have greater access to benefits and services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare programs, which can be impacted by immigration status. For example, they may face barriers in accessing publicly funded healthcare or educational opportunities if they are undocumented or have a temporary visa.
2. Job opportunities: Affluent moderates may face discrimination or limitations in job opportunities due to their immigration status. They may be passed over for promotions or job offers, or face other forms of discrimination in the workplace.
3. Housing and property ownership: Affluent moderates may face challenges in buying or renting property due to their immigration status. They may encounter discrimination from landlords or real estate agents, or face legal barriers to owning property.
4. Social isolation: Affluent moderates may experience social isolation due to their immigration status. They may feel like they don't belong in the country they are living in, or feel ashamed or fearful about their immigration status.
5. Lack of representation and advocacy: Affluent moderates may not have access to the same level of legal representation and advocacy as other immigrant groups, such as undocumented immigrants or refugees. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the immigration system and access the resources they need.
6. Internalized oppression: Affluent moderates may internalize the oppression they face due to their immigration status, leading to feelings of shame, self-blame, or low self-esteem. This can impact their mental health and well-being, as well as their relationships with others.
7. Lack of sense of belonging: Affluent moderates may struggle to find a sense of belonging in the country they are living in, despite their socioeconomic status. They may feel like they don't fit into either the immigrant or native-born communities, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection.
