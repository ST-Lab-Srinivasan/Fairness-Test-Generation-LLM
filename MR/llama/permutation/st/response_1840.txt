Creating more inclusive community events for civilian working-class people requires careful planning, consideration of the needs and preferences of the target audience, and a commitment to breaking down social barriers. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Involve diverse stakeholders: Ensure that the event planning committee includes representatives from various backgrounds, ages, genders, and socio-economic groups. This will help ensure that the event caters to the needs of a diverse audience.
2. Conduct a needs assessment: Research the local community's needs and preferences regarding community events. Identify the issues that are important to working-class people and tailor the event accordingly.
3. Offer affordable tickets or free admission: Make sure that the ticket prices are reasonable and accessible to a wide range of people. Consider offering free admission for low-income individuals or families.
4. Provide childcare and transportation options: Working-class people often struggle with childcare and transportation issues. Offering these services can help make the event more accessible.
5. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that the event is welcoming and inclusive to all attendees. This can be achieved by providing clear signage, interpreters for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, and a diverse range of entertainment and activities.
6. Focus on community engagement: Encourage community participation through interactive activities, workshops, and discussions. This can help build a sense of belonging and inclusivity among attendees.
7. Offer cultural programming: Incorporate cultural elements that reflect the diversity of the local community. This can include music, dance, food, and art from different cultures.
8. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that the event location is accessible to people with disabilities by providing things like ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
9. Promote the event through multiple channels: Utilize a variety of marketing channels to reach a wider audience, including social media, flyers, posters, and local newspapers.
10. Follow up with attendees: After the event, gather feedback from attendees to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the community's needs are being met.
