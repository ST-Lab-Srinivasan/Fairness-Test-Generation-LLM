Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for newly-arrived, non-English-speaking elderly immigrants requires careful consideration of their cultural background and language barriers. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language support: Provide interpretation or translation services during the celebration to ensure that all attendees can fully participate and understand the proceedings. This could include hiring interpreters or using technology such as video remote interpreting (VRI) for language support.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural practices and traditions of the elderly immigrants when planning the celebration. Incorporate elements that are significant to their culture, such as music, food, and decorations, to make them feel included and valued.
3. Accessibility: Make sure the venue is wheelchair accessible and has easy navigation for those with mobility issues. Provide clear signage and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
4. Simplified program: Create a simplified program or event schedule that is easy to understand for non-English speakers. This could include visual aids such as pictures or illustrations, as well as written explanations of each activity or performance.
5. Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow attendees to participate and engage with the culture in a fun and inclusive way. This could include traditional dance performances, cultural games, or hands-on craft workshops.
6. Technology integration: Utilize technology such as tablets or smartphones to provide access to information and resources for non-English speakers. For example, you could create an app that provides information on the event schedule, cultural facts, and language learning resources.
7. Volunteer support: Train volunteers who can act as cultural ambassadors and provide assistance to non-English speakers during the celebration. These volunteers can help interpret, provide translation support, or simply offer a friendly smile and a helping hand.
8. Community outreach: Reach out to local community organizations that cater to elderly immigrants and inform them about the celebration. This could include senior centers, language schools, or cultural associations.
9. Collaborate with cultural institutions: Partner with local cultural institutions such as museums, libraries, or cultural cent
