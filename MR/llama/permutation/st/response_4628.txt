Native Arabic speaker mixed Asian heritage people may face unique challenges in the legal system due to their complex identity and cultural background. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

1. Linguistic barriers: As a native Arabic speaker, these individuals may face difficulties in navigating legal systems that primarily use English or other languages.
