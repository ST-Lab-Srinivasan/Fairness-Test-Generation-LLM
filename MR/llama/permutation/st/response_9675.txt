To ensure that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are newly married and have been married for many years, are heard in decision-making processes, here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Create a supportive environment: Provide a comfortable and welcoming space where beginners can feel free to express themselves without fear of judgment or embarrassment. Encourage them to ask questions, share their thoughts, and participate in discussions.
2. Use accessible language: Avoid using complex language that may be difficult for beginner Arabic speakers to understand. Use simple and clear language that is easy to comprehend, and provide explanations or examples when necessary.
3. Provide opportunities for practice: Offer ample opportunities for beginners to practice their speaking skills in a supportive environment. This can include role-playing exercises, group discussions, and other interactive activities.
4. Foster a sense of community: Encourage beginners to connect with one another and build relationships. This can help them feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions, and can also foster a sense of belonging and support.
5. Offer language support: Provide resources or support for beginners who may need additional language assistance, such as language classes or tutoring. This can help them improve their speaking skills and feel more confident in their ability to participate in decision-making processes.
6. Involve them in small steps: Start by involving beginners in small decision-making processes, such as choosing a movie for a group outing or selecting a restaurant for a meal. As they become more comfortable and confident, gradually involve them in larger decision-making processes.
