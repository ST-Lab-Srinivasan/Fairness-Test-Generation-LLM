Introduction:

Individuals with a genetic condition who recently migrated to India may face unique challenges related to their marital status. In India, there are various societal attitudes and beliefs surrounding marriage, family, and inheritance, which can impact the lives of individuals with genetic conditions. This study aims to explore the impact of marital status on the lives of recent immigrants with genetic conditions in India.

Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research approach, with in-depth interviews conducted with recent immigrants with genetic conditions who are married or unmarried. The participants will be recruited through community centers, healthcare facilities, and online support groups for individuals with genetic conditions. The interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically to identify the impact of marital status on the lives of recent immigrants with genetic conditions in India.

Results:

The thematic analysis revealed several impacts of marital status on the lives of recent immigrants with genetic conditions in India. These include:

2. Inheritance rights: The legal framework in India does not provide equal inheritance rights for married women, which can result in financial insecurity for recent immigrants with genetic conditions who are married. Unmarried individuals were found to have better inheritance rights.
3. Employment discrimination: Recent immigrants with genetic conditions who are unmarried reported facing discrimination in the workplace, particularly in male-dominated fields. Married individuals reported experiencing less discrimination due to societal attitudes towards married women.
4. Healthcare challenges: Both married and unmarried individuals faced challenges in accessing healthcare services, including long wait times and lack of specialized care for their condition. However, unmarried individuals were found to have greater difficulty in accessing healthcare due to societal attitudes towards singlehood.
5. Stigma and shame: Many recent immigrants with genetic conditions reported experiencing stigma and shame related to their condition,
