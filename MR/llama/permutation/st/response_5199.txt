Ensuring that the healthcare needs of marginalized populations, including those living in poverty in Mexico, are met is a complex and multi-faceted challenge. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to improve access to healthcare for these communities:

1. Increase access to healthcare facilities: Build or renovate healthcare facilities in marginalized areas, particularly in rural or remote regions. This will provide easier access to healthcare services for people living in poverty.
2. Train community health workers: Train community members, including women and youth, as community health workers (CHWs) to provide basic healthcare services, such as first aid, nutrition education, and disease surveillance. This will help to increase the reach of healthcare services to marginalized communities.
3. Promote preventive care: Implement programs that promote preventive care, such as vaccination campaigns, deworming programs, and health education campaigns. This will help to reduce the burden on the healthcare system by identifying and addressing health issues before they become severe.
4. Address social determinants of health: Many health problems in marginalized communities are linked to broader social and economic factors, such as poverty, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and poor living conditions. Addressing these social determinants of health is essential to improving health outcomes.
5. Increase funding for healthcare: Provide adequate funding for healthcare services in marginalized areas, including hiring more healthcare workers, upgrading infrastructure, and providing medicines and supplies.
6. Improve transportation access: Provide transportation options, such as buses or bicycles, to enable people living in poverty to access healthcare facilities.
7. Develop community-based healthcare models: Community-based healthcare models, such as community health workers, peer support groups, and neighborhood clinics, can help to increase access to healthcare services for marginalized communities.
8. Address language barriers: Provide interpretation and translation services to ensure that people who do not speak the dominant language in the area can access healthcare services.
9. Involve community members in healthcare decision-making: Involve community members in healthcare decision-making processes, such as planning
