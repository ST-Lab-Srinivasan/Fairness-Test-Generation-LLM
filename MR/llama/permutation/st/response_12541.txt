The impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled beginner Chinese speakers can vary depending on cultural and social norms, personal beliefs, and individual experiences. Here are some possible impacts:

1. Social isolation: Beginners may feel isolated or excluded from social events and activities if they are not married or in a long-term romantic relationship. This can be particularly challenging for those who are eager to practice their Chinese language skills outside of the classroom.
