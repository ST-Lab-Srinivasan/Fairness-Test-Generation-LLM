As a strong atheist, recent immigrants to Canada may face unique challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the potential issues they may encounter:

Lack of religious accommodations: While Canada has a long tradition of religious freedom and tolerance, there may be instances where recent immigrants may feel that their non-religious beliefs are not being accommodated within the legal system.
