The impacts of immigration status on the lives of poor and moderate-income people can be significant, as they may face various challenges and limitations due to their immigration status. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many low-income and moderate-income immigrants may struggle to access healthcare services due to language barriers, lack of health insurance, or fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate medical care, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
2. Limited economic opportunities: Immigrants who are undocumented or have low immigration status may face limitations on their ability to find stable, well-paying jobs or start businesses. This can perpetuate cycles of poverty and limit their economic mobility.
3. Discrimination and stigma: Immigrants may experience discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status, which can lead to social isolation, emotional distress, and reduced access to resources and opportunities.
4. Limited access to education: Undocumented immigrants or those with low immigration status may face barriers to accessing education, including language barriers, lack of access to financial aid, and fear of deportation. This can limit their ability to improve their economic situation and achieve their goals.
5. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to significant stress, anxiety, and trauma for immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented or have low immigration status. This fear can also impact their mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.
6. Limited access to social services: Immigrants may face barriers to accessing social services, such as food assistance programs, housing support, and legal aid, due to their immigration status. This can exacerbate existing poverty and limit their ability to access critical resources.
7. Lack of representation and advocacy: Immigrants may have limited access to legal representation and advocacy, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complex immigration system and protect their rights.
8. Limited citizenship opportunities: Immigrants who are undocumented or have low immigration status may face barriers to obtaining citizenship, which can limit their ability to fully participate
