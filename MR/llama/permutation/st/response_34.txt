Promoting the cultural preservation of permanent resident Native natural-born US citizen communities is essential for ensuring the survival and continuation of their rich cultural heritage. Here are some ways to achieve this goal:

1. Support Native-led organizations: Provide financial and logistical support to Native-led organizations that work towards preserving and promoting Native cultures. These organizations are best positioned to understand the unique needs and challenges of their communities and can mobilize resources effectively.
2. Develop cultural education programs: Create educational programs that teach non-Native people about Native cultures, histories, and traditions. This can help bridge the gap between different communities and foster greater understanding and respect for Native cultures.
3. Encourage language revitalization: Many Native languages are at risk of disappearing due to a lack of speakers. Encourage language revitalization efforts by providing resources and support for language learning and cultural preservation.
4. Preserve historical sites and artifacts: Work with Native communities to preserve historical sites and artifacts that are important to their cultures. This can help preserve their cultural heritage and provide a tangible link to their past.
5. Support Native art and music: Promote the work of Native artists and musicians by providing platforms for them to showcase their talents. This can help preserve traditional arts and music while also promoting cultural exchange and understanding.
6. Collaborate with tribal governments: Work with tribal governments to develop policies and programs that support cultural preservation. This can include initiatives to protect traditional lands, resources, and cultural practices.
7. Engage in community outreach: Connect with Native communities through outreach efforts that promote cultural exchange and understanding. This can help build bridges between different communities and foster greater appreciation for Native cultures.
8. Provide cultural training: Offer training programs that teach non-Native people about Native cultures, histories, and traditions. This can help build cultural competence and promote greater understanding and respect for Native peoples.
9. Support Indigenous-led media initiatives: Encourage the development of Indigenous-led media initiatives that promote Native cultures and stories. This can help counteract the lack of representation and misrepresentation of Native peoples in mainstream media.
