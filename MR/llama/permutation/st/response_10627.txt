The impacts of marital status on the lives of native Chinese speaker cisgender infant female individuals can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social pressure: In traditional Chinese culture, marriage is highly valued, and there is often pressure on women to get married and start a family. This can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety for those who are not married by a certain age or who are unable to marry.
2. Gender roles: In many Asian cultures, including China, there are traditional gender roles that expect women to prioritize family and domestic duties over career aspirations. This can limit the opportunities and choices available to unmarried women, particularly those who are not financially independent.
3. Stigma: Unmarried women in China may face social stigma and discrimination, which can affect their mental health and well-being. This stigma can be especially pronounced for those who are over 27 years old, as the societal pressure to marry by a certain age is particularly strong in China.

8. Lack of social support: Unmarried women in China may have limited social support networks, which can leave them feeling isolated and disconnected from society.
9. Cultural expectations: In some parts of China, there are cultural expectations that women should prioritize family and domestic duties over career aspirations. This can limit the opportunities and choices available to unmarried women.
