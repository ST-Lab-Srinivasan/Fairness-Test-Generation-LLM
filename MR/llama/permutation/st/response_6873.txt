The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-middle-class, non-libertarian people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal and financial insecurity: Undocumented immigrants face the constant threat of deportation and may be unable to access basic rights and services, such as healthcare, education, and social security. They may also be vulnerable to exploitation by employers who take advantage of their fear of deportation to pay them low wages or deny them protections against abuse and discrimination.
2. Social isolation: Immigrants who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may experience social isolation, as they may be reluctant to form close relationships or seek support from friends and family due to fear of being reported to authorities.
3. Limited access to resources: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when trying to access basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. They may also have limited access to healthcare, education, and other services that are essential for their well-being.
4. Psychological distress: The constant stress and uncertainty of living with an uncertain immigration status can take a toll on mental health. Undocumented immigrants may experience anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
5. Lack of representation: Non-middle-class, non-libertarian people who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may have limited access to legal representation, which can further compound their vulnerability to exploitation and abuse.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may face discrimination and stigma from the general public, as well as from law enforcement and government agencies. This can lead to social exclusion and marginalization, which can have negative impacts on their mental and physical health.
7. Limited job opportunities: Non-middle-class, non-libertarian people who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may face barriers when trying to find employment, as they may be unable to access certain jobs or industries due to their immigration status.
8. Difficulty accessing basic needs: Undocumented immigrants may struggle to access basic necessities
