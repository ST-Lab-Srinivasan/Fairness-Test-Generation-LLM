Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of physically disabled long-time married couples, particularly those who are non-citizens or undocumented. Here are some potential effects:

1. Fear of deportation: Undocumented immigrants may live in constant fear of being deported, which can cause significant stress and anxiety. This fear can also impact their ability to access healthcare services, including those related to their physical disabilities.
2. Limited access to benefits: Non-citizens or undocumented immigrants may have limited access to social security benefits, disability benefits, or other forms of financial assistance that are available to U.S.-born citizens. This can make it more difficult for them to afford the accommodations and support they need to manage their physical disabilities.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against immigrants is still prevalent in many parts of the United States. Physically disabled immigrant couples may face discrimination when seeking housing, employment, or other services. This can further exacerbate their existing challenges and limit their opportunities for social and economic mobility.
4. Isolation: Non-citizens or undocumented immigrants may feel isolated and disconnected from their communities due to their immigration status. This can impact their mental health and wellbeing, particularly if they are unable to access support services or connect with other people in similar situations.
5. Stigma: Immigrants may face stigma and negative stereotypes based on their immigration status, which can affect their self-esteem and overall wellbeing. This can be particularly challenging for physically disabled couples who already face significant social barriers and discrimination.
6. Limited access to healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, non-citizens or undocumented immigrants may have limited access to healthcare services, including those related to their physical disabilities. This can make it more difficult for them to receive the necessary care and support to manage their conditions.
7. Fear of seeking help: Undocumented immigrants may be reluctant to seek help or support due to their fear of being deported. This can lead to delays in receiving appropriate care, which can worsen their physical disabilities over time
