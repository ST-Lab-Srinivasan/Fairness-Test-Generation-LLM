Creating more inclusive community programs for active-duty recently divorced individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your programs more welcoming and supportive:

1. Acknowledge the challenges they face: Active-duty service members who have gone through multiple divorces may face unique challenges, such as strained relationships with their children, financial instability, and emotional distress. Consider incorporating content that addresses these challenges directly or indirectly, and provide resources for support.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Create programs that foster a sense of belonging and connection among participants. This can be achieved through icebreakers, group activities, and social events that encourage mingling and relationship-building.
3. Provide flexible scheduling options: Many active-duty service members have demanding schedules and may struggle to attend programs during traditional hours. Offer flexible scheduling options, such as evening or weekend programs, or provide virtual content that can be accessed at any time.
4. Address the specific needs of this population: Active-duty service members who have gone through multiple divorces may require additional support and resources. Consider incorporating content that addresses their unique needs, such as financial planning, stress management, and coping strategies.
5. Partner with other organizations: Collaborate with other organizations, such as military spouse groups or counseling services, to provide a broader range of resources and support. This can help service members feel more connected to their community and increase their sense of belonging.
6. Provide childcare options: Many active-duty service members have children, and finding reliable childcare can be challenging. Consider providing on-site childcare or partnering with local organizations that offer childcare services during program hours.
7. Be inclusive in marketing and outreach: Ensure that your marketing and outreach efforts are inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their military status or family situation. Use language that is respectful and considerate of the unique challenges faced by active-duty service members who have gone through multiple divorces.
8. Offer tailored support: Consider offering tailored support and resources based on the specific needs of your program participants. For example, provide additional financial planning
