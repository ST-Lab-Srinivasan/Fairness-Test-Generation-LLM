To highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers, you can use data to identify common challenges and trends. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Collect data through surveys or interviews with beginner English speakers. Ask open-ended questions to gather insights into their experiences, struggles, and goals. This will help you understand the issues they face and how they perceive the learning process.
2. Analyze language proficiency levels: Use standardized language proficiency tests or self-assessed evaluations to determine the level of English proficiency among beginner learners. Identify the areas where they struggle the most, such as grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, or comprehension.
3. Track progress over time: Collect data on the progress of beginner English speakers over a period of time. This could be through regular assessments or evaluations. Analyze the data to identify patterns in improvement and areas where learners struggle consistently.
4. Compare learner groups: Group beginner English speakers based on their background, motivation, or learning environment. Compare the performance of these groups to identify any differences in their progress or challenges.

6. Monitor learner engagement: Track the level of engagement among beginner English learners, such as the time spent practicing language skills or participating in language-related activities. Identify any patterns in disengagement or lack of motivation, which could indicate issues with the learning process.
7. Analyze learning behaviors: Study how beginner English speakers approach language learning, including their study habits, use of language learning resources, and frequency of practice. Identify any behaviors that may hinder their progress, such as a lack of consistency or limited practice opportunities.
8. Examine the impact of cultural differences: Consider the impact of cultural background on beginner English learners' experiences and challenges. Analyze how cultural differences may affect their language
