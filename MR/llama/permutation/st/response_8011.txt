Financially disadvantaged Mexican people may face a number of challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal representation: Financial constraints can make it difficult for individuals to afford legal representation, particularly in complex cases where expertise and resources are needed. This can result in unequal access to justice and a lack of opportunities for redress.
2. Barriers to filing legal claims: Financially disadvantaged individuals may face barriers to filing legal claims, such as the cost of court fees, document preparation, and other administrative expenses. These costs can be prohibitively expensive, making it difficult for individuals to pursue legal action.
3. Difficulty navigating legal procedures: The legal system can be complex and intimidating, especially for those without legal training or experience. Financially disadvantaged individuals may struggle to navigate the legal process, which can lead to delays, errors, and missed opportunities for redress.
4. Lack of awareness about legal rights: Many financially disadvantaged individuals may be unaware of their legal rights and options, which can result in a lack of access to justice. This can be particularly true in areas where legal resources are limited or unavailable.
5. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist within the legal system, particularly against marginalized communities. Financially disadvantaged Mexican people may face discrimination and bias from judges, lawyers, and other legal actors, which can further complicate their ability to access justice.
6. Limited access to legal aid: In Mexico, legal aid programs are often underfunded or unavailable, particularly in rural areas. This can leave financially disadvantaged individuals with few options for seeking legal redress.
7. Lack of trust in the legal system: Financial struggles can lead to a lack of trust in the legal system, which can make it difficult for individuals to pursue legal action or seek justice through the courts. This mistrust can be particularly pronounced in communities where there has been historical mistreatment by the legal system.
8. Difficulty keeping up with changing laws and regulations: The legal system is constantly evolving, with new laws and regulations being introduced regularly. Finan
