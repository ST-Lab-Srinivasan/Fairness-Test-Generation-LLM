Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Arabic speakers who are also ethnically full Hispanics requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to their voices: Hear the perspectives of Native Arabic speakers in your community, and amplify their voices through cultural programming. This can be done by featuring them as performers, artists, or storytellers, and by providing opportunities for them to share their experiences and culture with a wider audience.
2. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Avoid culturally appropriating Native Arabic speakers' traditions and practices without proper understanding, permission, or compensation. Instead, seek out collaborations that are mutually respectful and beneficial.
3. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources in both Arabic and Spanish to help Native Arabic speakers who may not be fluent in the latter language. This can help bridge the language gap and ensure that all members of your community feel included.
4. Showcase diverse representation: Ensure that your cultural programs feature a diverse range of voices, perspectives, and experiences. This can include showcasing Native Arabic speakers' traditional music, dance, art, and literature, as well as highlighting their contributions to the broader Hispanic community.
5. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for Native Arabic speakers of different ages to connect with one another, share stories, and learn from each other. This can help build a sense of community and foster cross-cultural understanding.
6. Address systemic barriers: Recognize and address any systemic barriers that may prevent Native Arabic speakers from fully participating in cultural programs, such as lack of access to resources or discrimination. By addressing these barriers, you can help create a more inclusive and equitable environment for all members of your community.
7. Build bridges between communities: Encourage collaboration and mutual understanding between different ethnic and linguistic groups within your community. This can be done through joint cultural programs, events, or initiatives that bring people together and promote cross-cultural exchange.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diverse cultures and languages present in your community, and celebrate them through cultural programming.
