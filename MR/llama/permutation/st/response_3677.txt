The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who are lifelong single people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face social isolation due to various factors, including physical limitations, stigma, and discrimination. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Individuals with disabilities may encounter barriers in accessing educational opportunities or finding employment due to discrimination, lack of accommodations, or physical limitations. This can result in lower socio-economic status and fewer opportunities for personal growth and development.
3. Health disparities: People with disabilities may experience worse health outcomes compared to the general population due to a variety of factors, including limited access to healthcare services, lack of disability-related knowledge among healthcare providers, and social isolation.
4. Caregiving responsibilities: Lifelong single people with disabilities may take on caregiving responsibilities for family members or friends with disabilities, which can lead to significant emotional and financial burdens.
5. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities may encounter stigma and discrimination in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and social interactions. This can result in lower self-esteem, reduced opportunities, and a lack of inclusion.
6. Limited participation in civic life: Individuals with disabilities may face barriers to participating in civic life, such as voting, volunteering, or serving on boards and committees, due to physical limitations or discrimination.
7. Financial difficulties: People with disabilities may experience financial difficulties due to lower socio-economic status, limited access to education and employment opportunities, and higher healthcare costs.
8. Limited transportation options: Individuals with disabilities may face challenges in accessing transportation services, such as public transportation or driving, which can limit their independence and mobility.
9. Lack of accessible housing: People with disabilities may encounter difficulties finding accessible and affordable housing, leading to homelessness or suboptimal living situations.
10. Limited access to technology and assistive devices
