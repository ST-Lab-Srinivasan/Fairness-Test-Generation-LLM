Creating more inclusive recreational activities for documented employed people requires understanding their needs, preferences, and accessibility requirements. Here are some suggestions to make recreational activities more inclusive:

1. Offer a range of activities: Provide a variety of recreational activities that cater to different interests and abilities, such as sports, music, dance, art, and outdoor activities like hiking or camping.
2. Make facilities accessible: Ensure that the facilities are easily accessible for people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
3. Hire diverse staff: Train staff to be sensitive to the needs of diverse participants and provide cultural competence training to ensure everyone feels welcome.
4. Offer financial assistance: Provide financial aid or scholarships for people who cannot afford recreational activities, such as low-income families or individuals with disabilities.
5. Flexible scheduling: Offer activities at various times and locations to accommodate different work schedules and transportation needs.
6. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language and imagery in promotional materials to attract a diverse range of participants.
7. Partner with organizations: Collaborate with organizations that serve underrepresented communities, such as community centers, schools, and non-profits, to reach a broader audience.
8. Educational workshops: Offer educational workshops or classes on topics relevant to the diverse participants, such as cultural competence, accessibility awareness, or language skills.
9. Feedback mechanisms: Encourage participants to provide feedback on their experiences and suggestions for improvement to ensure that the recreational activities are tailored to meet their needs.
10. Community events: Host community events that celebrate diversity and inclusivity, such as cultural festivals or accessible outdoor activities.
