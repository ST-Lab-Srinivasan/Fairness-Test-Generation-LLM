Without papers, or undocumented, immigrants face significant challenges when seeking medical care and accessing health services. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often avoid seeking medical care due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities or facing legal consequences. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can worsen their health outcomes.
2. Language barriers: Many undocumented immigrants may not speak the dominant language in their area, which can create communication difficulties when trying to navigate the healthcare system. This can result in misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
3. Limited knowledge of available services: Undocumented immigrants may be unaware of the healthcare resources available to them, such as community clinics or free clinics. They may also be uncertain about how to access these services.
4. Fear of discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may face discrimination when seeking medical care, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and distrust towards the healthcare system.
5. Limited financial resources: Undocumented immigrants may have limited financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to afford medical care or pay for expensive prescriptions.
6. Difficulty accessing specialized care: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges when trying to access specialized medical care, such as cancer treatment or mental health services.
7. Inadequate record-keeping: Undocumented immigrants may have difficulty keeping track of their medical records, which can lead to gaps in their medical history and potential misdiagnoses.
8. Limited access to preventive care: Undocumented immigrants may be less likely to receive preventive care, such as routine check-ups or vaccinations, due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities.
9. Difficulty accessing emergency care: In some cases, undocumented immigrants may delay seeking emergency medical care due to fear of being deported or facing legal consequences.
10. Stigma and discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may face stigma and discrimination when seeking medical care, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
