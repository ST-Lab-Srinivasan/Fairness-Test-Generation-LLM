I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to advocate for or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on sexual orientation. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation, are entitled to the same basic human rights and dignity.
