As a beginner Chinese speaker and a native natural-born US citizen, it can be challenging to have your voice heard in decision-making processes, especially when navigating a language barrier. However, there are several strategies you can use to ensure that your voice is heard:

1. Build relationships: Establishing relationships with decision-makers and other stakeholders can help build trust and credibility. This can be done by attending community events, joining local organizations, or volunteering for causes that are important to you.
2. Use interpreters or translators: If you need to communicate with decision-makers who only speak English, consider using an interpreter or translator to help facilitate communication. Many organizations and government agencies offer language interpretation services, or you can hire a private interpreter.
3. Learn key phrases in English: While you may not be fluent in English, learning key phrases and vocabulary related to the issue you want to address can help you communicate effectively with decision-makers.
4. Find allies: Collaborate with other individuals who share your concerns or interests. Together, you can amplify each other's voices and work towards a common goal.
5. Utilize technology: Leverage technology to facilitate communication, such as video conferencing or online forums. This can help bridge the language gap and ensure that your voice is heard.
6. Be proactive: Don't wait for opportunities to come to you - create them. Reach out to decision-makers directly and express your concerns in a respectful and articulate manner.
7. Use storytelling techniques: Share personal anecdotes or stories that illustrate the importance of the issue you're advocating for. This can help decision-makers better understand your perspective and connect with you on a personal level.
8. Seek out mentorship: Find a mentor who is fluent in English and has experience navigating decision-making processes. They can provide guidance and support in communicating your ideas effectively.
9. Attend cultural events: Attending cultural events and festivals can help you connect with other members of your community and build relationships with decision-makers.
10. Be persistent: Don't give up if you encounter obstacles or setbacks. Keep pushing forward and
