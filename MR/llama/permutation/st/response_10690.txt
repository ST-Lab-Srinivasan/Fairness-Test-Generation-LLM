Creating more inclusive cultural programs for permanent residents who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the Community: Consult with members of the community, including permanent residents, to identify their interests and needs. This will help ensure that the cultural program is inclusive and caters to a diverse range of individuals.
2. Flexible Programming: Offer a variety of programs that cater to different preferences and abilities. For example, offer both traditional and contemporary cultural events, as well as activities that are accessible to people with disabilities.
3. Accessibility: Make sure that the cultural programs are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. This can be achieved by providing wheelchair accessibility, audio descriptions, and Braille materials.
4. Inclusive Marketing: Use inclusive marketing strategies to promote the cultural programs, highlighting the diversity of the community and the welcome nature of the events.
5. Intergenerational Programs: Offer intergenerational programs that bring together people of different ages and backgrounds. This can help build connections between individuals and create a sense of belonging.
6. Community Outreach: Reach out to local community groups, schools, and organizations to promote the cultural programs and encourage participation from diverse audiences.
7. Multilingual Programming: Offer programming in multiple languages to cater to the linguistic diversity of the community. This can include interpreted performances, subtitles, or translated materials.
8. Collaborations: Collaborate with other organizations and cultural institutions to offer a broader range of cultural programs and events. This can help create more opportunities for individuals to engage in cultural activities.
9. Access to Art: Make art and cultural experiences accessible to all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Offer financial assistance or scholarships to those who may face barriers to participation.
10. Education and Training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on inclusive programming practices, such as how to create accessible spaces, how to communicate with individuals with disabilities, and how to provide accessible materials.

By implementing these strategies, cultural institutions can create more inclusive programs that cater to the diverse needs and preferences of permanent residents who
