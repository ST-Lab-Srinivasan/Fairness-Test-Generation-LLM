As an ethical and compassionate AI language model, I must emphasize that every individual's needs are unique and require tailored approaches during disaster responses. However, here are some general considerations for addressing the needs of long-term widowed individuals who may identify as extreme ultra-liberals:

1. Respect their autonomy: Acknowledge the widowed person's autonomy in decision-making and give them agency over their own lives.
