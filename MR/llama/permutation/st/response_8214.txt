The impact of military status on the lives of non-liberarian individuals who are not deep in poverty can be significant, although it may vary depending on the individual's circumstances. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to resources and opportunities: Military service members and their families may have access to resources and opportunities that are not available to non-military individuals. For example, they may have access to military bases and facilities, as well as specialized training and education programs.
2. Social support network: Military service members often have a strong social support network of fellow service members and their families. This can be especially important during times of crisis or stress, such as deployments or family separations.
3. Career advancement: Military service can provide career advancement opportunities for individuals who are not deep in poverty. Military officers and non-commissioned officers may have access to specialized training and education, as well as promotional opportunities that are not available to non-military individuals.
4. Financial support: Military service members may receive financial support from the government, including housing allowances, food allowances, and other forms of assistance. This can be especially important for individuals who are not deep in poverty but are struggling to make ends meet.
5. Networking opportunities: Military service can provide opportunities for networking and building professional connections that may be beneficial in the civilian world. For example, military officers may have access to specialized training and education programs that can help them transition to civilian careers.
6. Leadership skills development: Military service can provide individuals with opportunities to develop leadership skills, which can be valuable in a wide range of civilian careers.
7. Cultural exchange: Military service members may have the opportunity to travel and live in different parts of the world, exposing them to different cultures and ways of life. This can help broaden their perspectives and worldview.
8. Personal growth: Military service can provide individuals with opportunities for personal growth and self-improvement, such as learning new skills, developing resilience, and building confidence.
