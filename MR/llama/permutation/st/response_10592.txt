It is important to recognize that the impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-able-bodied, non-divorced individuals can vary greatly depending on a range of factors, including their specific immigration status, the context in which they are living, and the broader social and economic conditions in their community. Here are some potential impacts that immigration status may have on the lives of non-able-bodied, non-divorced individuals:

1. Uncertainty and instability: Individuals with irregular or uncertain immigration status may experience ongoing stress and uncertainty about their future in a particular country or region. This can make it difficult to plan for the long-term, pursue education or career goals, or establish roots in a community.
2. Limited access to services and resources: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may face barriers when accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, or social support. For example, undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care for fear of deportation or detention.
3. Discrimination and stigma: Immigration status can sometimes be linked to discrimination and stigma, particularly against marginalized groups such as refugees, asylum seekers, or undocumented immigrants. This can lead to social isolation, emotional distress, and reduced access to opportunities and resources.
4. Financial insecurity: Immigration status can also impact an individual's financial security, particularly if they are undocumented or have limited access to employment or financial resources. This can lead to difficulties paying for basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare.
5. Limited political voice: Individuals with irregular immigration status may face challenges when attempting to advocate for their rights or participate in the political process. This can limit their ability to influence policy decisions that affect their lives.
6. Social isolation: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may experience social isolation or exclusion from social events and activities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, disconnection, and marginalization.
7. Mental health impacts: The stress and uncertainty associated with immigration status can have significant mental health impacts, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress
