As an AI language model, I do not have access to personal information or specific individuals' situations. However, I can provide some general challenges that older adults may face when navigating the healthcare system as advanced beginners or over 85-year-olds in China:

1. Language barriers: Older adults who are not fluent in Mandarin Chinese may struggle to communicate effectively with healthcare providers, especially if they have difficulty speaking or understanding the language. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and delayed treatment.
