Ensuring the healthcare needs of Mexican upper lower middle-income people can be a complex challenge, as it requires addressing various social, economic, and political factors. Here are some potential strategies that could help:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: One of the main challenges facing Mexican upper lower middle-income people is access to quality healthcare services.

Governments and private organizations can work towards addressing these determinants by providing access to quality education, affordable housing, and economic opportunities.
5. Improve mental health services: Mental health is an essential aspect of overall health, and many Mexican upper lower middle-income people struggle with mental health issues due to lack of access to care. Governments and private organizations can work towards improving mental health services by providing education and resources on mental health, increasing access to mental health professionals, and reducing stigma associated with seeking mental health care.
