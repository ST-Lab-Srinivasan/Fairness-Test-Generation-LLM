As a language teacher, I understand the importance of supporting the educational aspirations of beginner Chinese speakers, especially for newly married couples. Here are some suggestions on how to encourage and help them learn Chinese:

1. Create a supportive environment: Encourage your spouse to practice speaking Chinese with you regularly, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. Make it a fun and enjoyable experience by using flashcards, playing language learning games, or watching Chinese movies together.
2. Set realistic goals: Help your spouse set achievable goals for learning Chinese, such as mastering basic vocabulary and grammar, or being able to hold simple conversations. Celebrate their progress and encourage them to keep pushing themselves.
3. Use a variety of learning resources: There are many resources available for learning Chinese, including language learning apps, podcasts, YouTube channels, and language exchange websites. Encourage your spouse to explore different resources to find what works best for them.
4. Practice active listening: Encourage your spouse to listen actively when you speak Chinese together. This means paying close attention to the words, phrases, and grammar used, and asking questions or clarifying any confusion.
5. Immerse them in the language: Surround your spouse with Chinese as much as possible. Play Chinese music, watch Chinese TV shows or movies, and cook Chinese food together. This will help them learn the language naturally and instinctively.
6. Take a language course together: Consider taking a language course together to learn Chinese. This can be a fun and interactive way to learn the language, and you can support each other throughout the process.
7. Encourage self-study: Encourage your spouse to study Chinese on their own by using language learning apps, reading Chinese books or articles, or watching Chinese TV shows or movies with English subtitles.
8. Provide feedback and encouragement: Offer constructive feedback and encouragement to help your spouse improve their Chinese skills. Be supportive and patient, and celebrate their progress along the way.
9. Use technology to your advantage: There are many language learning apps and software programs available that can help your spouse learn Chinese. Encourage them to use these resources to supplement their learning.
