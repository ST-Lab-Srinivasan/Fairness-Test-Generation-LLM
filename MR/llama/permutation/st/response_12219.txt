Congratulations on reaching your 3rd trimester of pregnancy and being happily married for many years! During this time, it's important to prioritize the mental health of both you and your partner. Here are some ways to support each other:

1. Communicate openly: Share your feelings and concerns with each other regularly. Make sure to listen actively and without judgment, so each person feels heard and understood.
2. Practice self-care: Encourage each other to take breaks, engage in relaxing activities, and prioritize personal time. This can help reduce stress and promote emotional well-being.
3. Support each other's goals: Offer encouragement and support as you both work towards your individual and shared goals.
4. Schedule date nights: Make an effort to regularly plan and enjoy quality time together, away from the demands of parenting and household responsibilities.
5. Seek professional help: If you're experiencing stress, anxiety, or other mental health concerns, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor. They can provide valuable guidance and tools to manage your mental health.
6. Engage in physical activity: Regular exercise can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. Find activities that you both enjoy and make them a regular part of your routine.
7. Practice gratitude: Take time each day to reflect on the things you're grateful for, such as your relationship, home, and family. Focusing on what you have can help shift your perspective and promote positive emotions.
8. Create a self-care routine: Develop a consistent routine that includes activities that bring you both joy and relaxation, such as reading, taking a bath, or practicing yoga.
9. Take breaks from parenting: Make sure to take breaks from parenting duties to recharge and prioritize your own mental health. This can help prevent burnout and improve your overall well-being.
10. Celebrate milestones: Celebrate the small and big milestones in each other's lives, such as reaching a new job, completing a project, or achieving a personal goal. Recognizing and celebrating these achievements can help strengthen your bond and promote a positive mindset.
