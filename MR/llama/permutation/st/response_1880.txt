Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that considers their cultural background, language needs, and overall well-being. Here are some suggestions to help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Provide multilingual signage and communication: Use both Arabic and English (or the local language) on signs, maps, and other communication materials to cater to native Arabic speakers who may not be fluent in the dominant language of the region.
2. Offer interpretation services: Provide interpretation services during events or meetings to ensure that moderate native Arabic speakers can fully participate and understand the content being presented.
3. Create age-appropriate programming: Develop programs and activities that cater to different age groups, including children, youth, and adults. This will help create a more inclusive environment for all members of the community.
4. Incorporate Arabic culture into public spaces: Incorporate elements of Arabic culture, such as music, art, and traditions, into public spaces to create a more welcoming environment for native Arabic speakers.
5. Provide accessible infrastructure: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and other accessibility features.
6. Engage with the community: Engage with the local Arabic-speaking community through surveys, focus groups, or other consultation methods to better understand their needs and preferences when creating public spaces.
7. Offer tailored services: Offer tailored services, such as language classes or cultural events, to cater to the specific needs of moderate native Arabic speakers.
8. Create a diverse workforce: Ensure that the workforce in public spaces is diverse and inclusive, including individuals who are fluent in Arabic and other languages spoken in the region.
9. Encourage community participation: Encourage community participation through events, activities, or volunteer opportunities to help create a sense of belonging among native Arabic speakers.
10. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for staff and volunteers to better understand the needs and preferences of moderate native Arabic speakers and to avoid unintentional cultural faux pas
