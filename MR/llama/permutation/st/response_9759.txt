Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of mixed Asian heritage democratic socialists. Here are some ways mentorship can support their growth:

Identity formation: Growing up with multiple Asian cultures and identities can be challenging, especially when there is a lack of representation or understanding of these identities within mainstream society.
