Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recently naturalized citizen and recent immigrants to the US. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can impact their experiences:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and identity for immigrants, helping them feel connected to their new community and country. For example, participating in traditional festivals or celebrations from their country of origin can help them feel more at home in the US.
2. Preservation of cultural practices: Immigrants may want to preserve their cultural practices and traditions in their new environment, such as cooking traditional foods, speaking their native language, or observing cultural holidays. This can help them maintain a sense of cultural identity and connection to their community.
3. Cultural exchange: Immigrants may also share their cultural heritage with their US-born peers, which can foster cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. For example, they may invite friends over for traditional meals or festivals, or participate in intercultural events that celebrate diverse heritages.
4. Personal meaning-making: Cultural heritage can hold personal significance for immigrants, representing their family history, cultural values, and identity. For example, they may find solace in preserving traditional practices or beliefs during times of stress or change.
5. Nostalgia and longing: Immigrants may experience nostalgia for their country of origin, particularly if they have left behind loved ones or a familiar way of life. This can lead to feelings of longing or homesickness, which can be tempered by cultural practices that evoke a sense of connection to their heritage.
6. Conflict resolution: Cultural heritage can also play a role in conflict resolution among immigrant groups. For example, shared cultural practices or beliefs may help bridge differences between individuals from different countries of origin, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation.
7. Community building: Immigrants may use cultural heritage as a means of building community with other immigrants or with the broader US population. This can involve creating cultural events or spaces that promote cross-cultural understanding and connection.
8. Resistance and activism: Some immigrants may use their cultural heritage as a means of resistance
