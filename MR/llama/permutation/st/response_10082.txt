As a beginner Chinese speaker young adult in the healthcare system, there are several challenges that you may face:

1. Language barriers: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. As a non-native Chinese speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively with patients, families, and other healthcare professionals who speak limited English or no English at all.
