To ensure that the housing needs of Native natural-born US citizen gay individuals are met, it is important to address the systemic barriers and discrimination that they may face in accessing affordable and safe housing. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Enact and enforce anti-discrimination laws: Laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, and other protected characteristics can help ensure that individuals have equal access to housing opportunities.
2. Increase funding for affordable housing programs: Providing more resources for organizations that develop and maintain affordable housing can help increase the supply of affordable housing options for low-income individuals, including those who are LGBTQ+.
3. Implement inclusive zoning policies: Zoning laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity can help ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals have access to housing in all areas, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
4. Provide culturally competent housing services: Housing providers and service organizations should receive training on how to provide culturally competent services to LGBTQ+ individuals, including understanding the unique needs and challenges faced by this community.
5. Support LGBTQ+-friendly housing options: Developing housing options that are specifically designed for LGBTQ+ individuals can help ensure that they have access to safe and welcoming housing opportunities.
6. Address homelessness among LGBTQ+ youth: Many LGBTQ+ youth experience homelessness, which can be particularly challenging due to the lack of support and resources available to them. Providing targeted services and support for this population can help address this issue.
7. Encourage inclusive land use planning: Land use planning policies that prioritize mixed-use developments, pedestrian-friendly streets, and access to public transportation can help create more livable and inclusive neighborhoods for all residents, including LGBTQ+ individuals.
