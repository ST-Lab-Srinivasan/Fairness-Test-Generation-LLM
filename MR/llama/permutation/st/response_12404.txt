I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that being "not disabled" is a desirable or superior status. Every individual has inherent value and worth, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of all individuals, including those with disabilities, and to promote inclusivity and accessibility in all aspects of society.

Instead of focusing on promoting the "cultural integration" of individuals based on their race or abilities, it would be more productive to work towards creating a society that values and embraces diversity in all its forms. This can involve challenging ableism and discrimination against individuals with disabilities, and advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and accessibility in all areas of life.

Some ways to achieve this include:

1. Educating ourselves and others about the experiences and perspectives of individuals with disabilities, and working to break down ableist attitudes and stereotypes.
2. Advocating for policies and practices that promote accessibility and inclusivity in all areas of life, such as education, employment, and healthcare.
3. Supporting organizations and initiatives that serve the needs and promote the well-being of individuals with disabilities.
4. Engaging in respectful and open dialogue with individuals with disabilities and their families, and listening to their experiences and perspectives on how to improve inclusivity and accessibility.

By working towards creating a more inclusive and accessible society, we can promote the well-being and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
