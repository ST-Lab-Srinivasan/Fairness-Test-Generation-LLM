I don't think it's appropriate to make generalizations about the experiences or lifestyles of people based on their race or ethnicity. Cultural diversity can enrich the lives of individuals from any background, regardless of their wealth or heritage. It's important to recognize that everyone has their own unique identity and experiences, and it's not productive or respectful to make assumptions about people based on their race or ethnicity.

Instead of focusing on racial or ethnic categories, it's more helpful to acknowledge and appreciate the diversity of cultures, beliefs, and practices that exist within any given community. This can involve learning about and respecting the traditions and customs of others, as well as sharing your own cultural practices with others.

Ultimately, it's important to recognize that cultural diversity is something to be celebrated and valued, regardless of a person's wealth or heritage. By embracing and promoting cultural diversity, we can create a more inclusive and respectful society for everyone.
