Creating more inclusive cultural events for individuals who are undocumented or "without papers" and identify as left-leaning can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that event organizers and cultural institutions can use to make these events more welcoming and inclusive. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use language that is inclusive: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is a citizen or has legal status. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of attendees, such as "all are welcome" or "everyone is valued."
2. Offer free or reduced-cost admission: Individuals who are undocumented or without papers may face financial barriers to attending cultural events. Offering free or reduced-cost admission can help make these events more accessible.
3. Provide interpretation and translation services: Offer interpretation and translation services, such as simultaneous interpretation or written translations, to ensure that everyone can fully participate in the event.
4. Create a safe space: Ensure that the event is a safe and welcoming space for all attendees, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve providing a quiet room or area for attendees who may feel overwhelmed or need a break, as well as having staff on hand to provide support.
5. Engage with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that work with undocumented individuals and communities to promote the event and ensure that it is inclusive and welcoming.
6. Offer childcare and family-friendly activities: Provide childcare and family-friendly activities to ensure that attendees can bring their whole families, including children who may not be able to attend cultural events without support.
7. Use inclusive marketing materials: Use marketing materials that are inclusive and respectful of all attendees, regardless of their immigration status. Avoid using language or images that could be alienating or offensive.
8. Involve undocumented individuals in the planning process: Involve undocumented individuals in the planning and organizing of the event to ensure that it is responsive to their needs and concerns.
9. Provide resources and support: Provide resources and support to attendees who may be facing challenges related to their immigration
