Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative, non-recently widowed individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Understand the diversity of the community: Recognize that the community is diverse and includes people with different backgrounds, beliefs, and practices. Be mindful of these differences when planning cultural celebrations.
2. Involve diverse representatives in planning: Engage individuals from different backgrounds and communities in the planning process to ensure that their perspectives are taken into account.
3. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for those who may not participate in certain cultural practices, such as vegetarian or vegan options at a traditional food-based celebration.
4. Be mindful of language and imagery: Use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and communities. Avoid stereotypes and tropes that can be offensive or alienating.
5. Create safe spaces: Provide safe spaces for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can include designated areas for cultural expression, such as dance or music performances.
6. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Continuously engage in open and respectful dialogue with the community to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account.
7. Be adaptable: Be willing to adapt and make changes based on feedback from the community. This can include modifying traditions or practices to be more inclusive or accommodating.
8. Foster intercultural understanding: Encourage intercultural understanding and exchange by providing opportunities for individuals from different cultures to share their experiences and traditions with each other.
9. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that the cultural celebration creates a welcoming and inclusive environment for all participants, regardless of their cultural background or identity.
10. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops to help individuals understand and appreciate different cultures and traditions. This can include information on cultural etiquette, customs, and practices.

By following these steps, you can create more inclusive cultural celebrations that are welcoming and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their cultural background
