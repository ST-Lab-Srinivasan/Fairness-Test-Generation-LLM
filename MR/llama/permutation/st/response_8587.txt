Native Chinese speakers who are recent immigrants to the US may face a number of challenges when interacting with the legal system. Here are some potential issues they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: As you might expect, one of the biggest challenges faced by native Chinese speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and procedures can be complex and difficult to understand for those who are not fluent in English. This can make it harder for them to navigate the legal system and access legal services.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the US is based on common law, which can be quite different from the civil law system used in China. For example, the burden of proof is on the prosecution in criminal cases in the US, whereas in China, the burden of proof is on the defense.

8. Difficulty understanding the legal system: The US legal system is based on a adversarial model, which
