1. Cultural sensitivity training for staff: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and awareness for all staff members, particularly those who work directly with Chinese students. This will help them understand the cultural norms and values of the community they are serving.
2. Language support: Offer language support services such as interpreters or translation support to help bridge the language gap between teachers and students who may not speak fluent English.
