Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of elderly individuals, particularly those from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Hispanic elders, in particular, may face unique challenges related to their mixed heritage. This study aims to explore the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of mixed Hispanic heritage elderly female people and identify potential strategies for improving their health outcomes.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds may experience worse health outcomes due to a lack of culturally sensitive healthcare services (Betancourt et al., 2013). In the case of Hispanic elders, cultural and linguistic barriers can further complicate their access to healthcare (Krauss & Rowe, 2017). Genetic conditions can also have a profound impact on an individual's quality of life, particularly if they are not properly diagnosed or managed (Hedican et al., 2009).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with mixed Hispanic heritage elderly female individuals to explore their experiences with genetic conditions. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers, ensuring a diverse sample of individuals. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Outcomes:
The study will provide valuable insights into the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of mixed Hispanic heritage elderly female individuals. Specifically, it is expected to reveal the following:

1. The ways in which genetic conditions affect the physical, emotional, and social well-being of mixed Hispanic heritage elderly female individuals.
2. The challenges faced by these individuals in accessing culturally sensitive healthcare services.
3. The potential benefits of culturally competent care for improving health outcomes among this population.
4. Recommendations for healthcare providers and policymakers to address the unique needs of mixed Hispanic heritage elderly female individuals.

Significance:
This study will contribute to the growing body of literature
