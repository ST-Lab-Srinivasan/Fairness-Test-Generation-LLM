Promoting the social inclusion of Native American natural-born US citizen blue-collar communities requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the historical and systemic barriers that have hindered their economic and social progress. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and job training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that prepare Native Americans for in-demand jobs and industries, such as clean energy, technology, and healthcare. This will help bridge the skills gap and create more opportunities for economic mobility.
2. Entrepreneurship and small business development: Encourage Native American entrepreneurs to start and grow their own businesses, which can create jobs and stimulate local economies. Provide resources and support for business planning, financing, and operations.
3. Economic empowerment programs: Implement initiatives that help Native Americans build wealth and financial stability, such as savings accounts, homeownership programs, and microloans.
4. Community development: Invest in community development projects that promote social cohesion and address the root causes of poverty, such as affordable housing, infrastructure improvements, and access to basic services like healthcare and education.
5. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Support Native American cultural preservation and revitalization efforts, which can help foster a sense of identity and belonging among community members. This can include language revitalization programs, cultural festivals, and traditional arts and crafts initiatives.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address the systemic barriers facing Native American blue-collar communities, such as inadequate funding for education and infrastructure, discriminatory land use practices, and lack of representation in government decision-making processes.
7. Collaboration with local organizations: Work closely with local organizations, such as tribal governments, community centers, and non-profits, to identify and address the unique needs of each Native American community.
8. Capacity building: Provide training and technical assistance to help Native American communities build their capacity to deliver social services, including mental health support, substance abuse treatment, and youth development programs.
