Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants to India, especially those who identify as extreme or moderate liberals, can be challenging due to the country's cultural and societal norms. However, there are several ways to promote their inclusivity:

1. Language classes: Provide language classes specifically designed for immigrants, focusing on basic Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, or Tamil, as well as English. This will help them communicate effectively and navigate everyday situations.
2. Cultural orientation programs: Organize cultural orientation programs to educate immigrants about India's customs, traditions, and social norms. This can include workshops on etiquette, dressing appropriately, and understanding local values.
3. Social events: Host social events that encourage mingling between immigrants and native Indians. This could be as simple as potluck dinners or as elaborate as cultural festivals. The goal is to create opportunities for interaction and bonding.
4. Advocacy groups: Set up advocacy groups specifically for immigrants, where they can share their experiences, provide support, and work together to address common challenges. This can also help build a sense of community and belonging.
5. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair immigrants with experienced Indians, who can offer guidance on navigating local culture and society. This can be especially helpful for new arrivals who may feel overwhelmed or unsure of how to proceed.
6. Education and awareness: Launch campaigns to raise awareness about the contributions of immigrants to Indian society, as well as the importance of diversity and inclusivity. This can involve organizing workshops, lectures, or public events that promote cross-cultural understanding.
7. Access to healthcare: Ensure that immigrants have access to affordable and quality healthcare services. This may involve partnering with local clinics or hospitals to provide specialized care for diverse patient populations.
8. Legal support: Provide legal assistance to immigrants, helping them navigate the complex Indian legal system and address any issues related to visas, work permits, or residency status.
9. Community service projects: Organize community service projects that bring immigrants together
