As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that supporting the social inclusion of beginner French speakers who are not in a relationship is essential for their well-being and overall quality of life. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Language exchange programs: Organize or participate in language exchange programs where beginner French speakers can practice speaking with native French speakers or more advanced learners. This helps build confidence and improves communication skills.
2. Language classes: Enroll in a language class specifically designed for beginners, which provides a supportive environment to learn and practice French. These classes often have a low student-to-teacher ratio, ensuring personalized attention and feedback.
3. Online language learning platforms: Utilize online resources such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone, which offer interactive lessons and exercises specifically designed for beginners. These platforms can be accessed from anywhere and at any time, making them convenient for those who may feel isolated or have limited access to traditional language classes.
4. Language meetups: Attend local language meetups or events where beginner French speakers can mingle with others who share the same language learning goals. This provides an opportunity to practice speaking and listening in a relaxed atmosphere.
5. Volunteer work: Consider volunteering for organizations that offer language classes or tutoring to marginalized communities, such as immigrant centers or refugee shelters. Not only can this help improve the social inclusion of beginner French speakers, but it also provides an opportunity to give back to the community.
6. Social events: Host or participate in social events specifically designed for beginner French speakers, such as potlucks, picnics, or movie nights. These events provide a relaxed atmosphere where learners can practice their language skills and connect with others who share similar interests.
7. Language-themed activities: Organize or participate in language-themed activities like cooking classes, wine tastings, or cultural events. These activities allow beginner French speakers to engage with the language in a more immersive setting, improving their overall proficiency and cultural understanding.
8. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that match beginner French speakers with native speakers or more advanced learners who can provide guidance
