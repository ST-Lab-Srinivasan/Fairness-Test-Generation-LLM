In Nigeria, there are several challenges that not wealthy or poor multimillionaire Nigerian people face in the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to legal representation: Many low-income individuals in Nigeria cannot afford legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the legal system and advocate for their rights.
2. Limited access to justice: The legal system in Nigeria is often slow and inefficient, which can make it difficult for people to access justice, especially in rural areas where there may be limited access to legal resources.
3. Corruption: Corruption is a significant challenge in the legal system in Nigeria, with many instances of bribery and other forms of corruption occurring within the legal system. This can make it difficult for people to receive fair treatment under the law.
4. Lack of trust: Many Nigerians do not trust the legal system, particularly those from marginalized communities, due to a lack of representation and a sense of inequality in the system.
5. Limited awareness of legal rights: Many low-income individuals in Nigeria may not be aware of their legal rights and how to access them, which can lead to a lack of protection for these individuals under the law.
6. Limited resources: Low-income individuals in Nigeria may not have access to the resources they need to navigate the legal system, such as legal aid organizations or advocacy groups.
7. Discrimination: The legal system in Nigeria can be discriminatory, particularly against marginalized communities, such as women, children, and people with disabilities.
8. Limited access to information: Many low-income individuals in Nigeria may not have access to the information they need to navigate the legal system, such as legal precedents or laws that apply to their situation.
9. Lack of political will: The government may not prioritize addressing the challenges faced by low-income individuals in the legal system, which can result in a lack of progress on these issues.
10. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Many low-income individuals in Nigeria may not have access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation or arbitration, which can provide an alternative to going to court.
