6. Healthcare Access: Connect immigrants with healthcare providers or organizations that offer low-cost or free medical services. This can help them access essential healthcare services without facing financial barriers.
7. Legal Services: Provide legal aid or connect immigrants with organizations that offer low-cost or free legal services. This can help them navigate the US legal system and address any legal issues they may encounter.
