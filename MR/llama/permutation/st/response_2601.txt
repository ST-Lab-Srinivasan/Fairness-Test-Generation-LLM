As a beginner Chinese speaker over the age of 90, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the healthcare system in China. Here are some potential challenges and suggestions for how to overcome them:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge for many older Chinese learners is the language barrier. As a beginner, you may find it difficult to communicate with healthcare professionals, especially if you have difficulty speaking or understanding Mandarin Chinese. To overcome this challenge, consider bringing a family member or friend who speaks Chinese to appointments and medical procedures. You can also use translation apps or written materials, such as brochures or flyers, to help you understand the information provided by healthcare professionals.

To overcome this challenge, consider exploring community-based healthcare services or non-profit organizations that provide healthcare support for seniors in your area. You can also consult with your local government or social welfare agency for information on available resources and support.
