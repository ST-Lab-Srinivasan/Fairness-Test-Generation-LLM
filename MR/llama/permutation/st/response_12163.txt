Ensuring that the financial needs of recently arrived immigrants in the US, especially those who have just turned 65, are met can be a challenging task. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Access to Health Insurance: Many immigrants, especially older adults, may not have access to health insurance upon arrival in the US. To address this, there could be initiatives to provide low-cost or subsidized health insurance options for these individuals, such as through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
2. Financial Assistance Programs: Establishing financial assistance programs specifically designed for recently arrived immigrants can help them cover basic living expenses, such as rent/mortgage, utilities, and food. These programs could be funded through government grants, non-profit organizations, or private donations.
3. Language Barriers: For many immigrants, particularly those who are older or have limited English proficiency, navigating financial systems in the US can be daunting. To overcome this challenge, language barrier support services could be provided through partnerships between community organizations and government agencies.
4. Capacity Building: Providing training and resources to help immigrants build their financial literacy and capability can help them better manage their finances. This could include workshops on budgeting, saving, and investing, as well as access to financial advisors who speak their native language.
5. Employment Supports: Many recent immigrants face significant barriers to finding employment in the US, including a lack of work experience or knowledge of the job market. To address this, job training programs and career counseling services could be provided specifically for immigrant populations.
6. Social Security Benefits: For recently arrived immigrants who have worked in the US without legal status, accessing Social Security benefits may be difficult. However, there are potential solutions, such as creating a pathway to citizenship or providing temporary work authorization to allow them to contribute to the Social Security system.
7. Housing Assistance: Many recent immigrants face challenges securing affordable housing in the US. To address this, government-subsidized housing programs or non-profit organizations could provide assistance with rent/mortgage pay
