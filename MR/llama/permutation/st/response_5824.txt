Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty Native natural-born US citizens are met is crucial for their academic success and personal growth. Here are some strategies to address the unique challenges faced by these students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training and resources for teachers to incorporate traditional knowledge and cultural practices into curriculum design and instruction. This can help Native students feel seen, heard, and valued in their educational experiences.
2. Cultural sensitivity and humility: Encourage educators to be mindful of the cultural differences and histories of Native American communities. This can involve learning about Native cultures, traditions, and histories, as well as acknowledging the impact of colonization and systemic racism on these communities.
3. Supportive learning environments: Create safe and inclusive learning spaces that promote cultural humility, respect, and understanding. This can involve incorporating traditional practices and beliefs into classroom activities and creating opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives.
4. Access to culturally relevant resources: Provide access to books, media, and other educational materials that reflect the cultural diversity of Native American communities. This can help broaden the curriculum and provide role models and representations that are more inclusive and representative of Native students' identities.
5. Community partnerships and collaborations: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities to co-design and deliver educational programs that are culturally responsive and tailored to their needs. This can involve working with elders, community leaders, and other cultural experts to develop curriculum and instructional materials that are grounded in traditional knowledge and practices.
6. Identity-based mentorship: Provide opportunities for Native students to connect with mentors who share their cultural background and identity. This can involve creating mentorship programs that pair Native students with Native role models, such as elders, community leaders, or other successful Native professionals.
7. Addressing systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address the systemic barriers facing Native American students, such as inadequate funding, lack of resources, and discrimination. This can involve advocating for policy changes at the local, state, or federal level to better support the educational needs of Native American students.
