Promoting the inclusion of mixed African-American active-duty individuals in professional athletics requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various levels, from grassroots community programs to systemic changes within sports organizations. Here are some strategies that can help promote inclusivity:

1. Grassroots outreach and development programs: Implement community-based programs that cater to underserved areas with a high concentration of mixed African-American individuals. These programs can provide opportunities for young athletes to develop their skills, receive coaching and mentorship, and gain access to resources and networks that can help them reach their full potential.
2. Diversity and inclusion training: Provide training sessions for sports organizations, coaches, and officials to address issues of diversity and inclusion. These trainings can help create a more inclusive environment and culture within sports organizations, reducing bias and discrimination.
3. Scholarships and financial support: Offer scholarships and financial support to mixed African-American athletes to help them cover the costs associated with participating in sports, such as equipment, travel, and training expenses. This can help level the playing field and provide more opportunities for underrepresented groups to participate.
4. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair mixed African-American athletes with successful professionals in their respective sports. These mentors can provide guidance, support, and networking opportunities to help mentees achieve their goals and overcome obstacles.
5. Media representation and coverage: Increase media representation and coverage of mixed African-American athletes in professional sports. This can help raise their profiles and create more exposure for underrepresented groups, which can lead to increased opportunities and recognition.
6. Advocacy and activism: Engage in advocacy and activism efforts to address systemic barriers and biases that prevent mixed African-American athletes from participating in professional sports. This can involve working with sports organizations, government agencies, and community groups to promote policy changes and create more inclusive environments.
7. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with community organizations that cater to underserved populations to provide sports programming and opportunities for mixed African-American athletes. These collaborations can help create more access points and opportunities for individuals to participate in sports
