Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American natural-born US citizens, particularly those who identify as moderate. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or community. For Native Americans, cultural heritage is deeply intertwined with their identities and sense of self, as it reflects their connection to their ancestors, their history, and their community.

For moderate Native American individuals, cultural heritage serves as a source of comfort, strength, and identity. It provides a sense of belonging and connection to a larger community beyond their individual experiences. Cultural heritage also plays a role in shaping their values, beliefs, and practices, influencing how they view themselves and their place within society.

Here are some ways that cultural heritage shapes the identities of moderate Native American individuals:

1. Sense of Belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a larger community and a connection to ancestors and elders. This helps moderate Native Americans feel grounded and rooted in their culture, which can be particularly important in a society that often marginalizes or overlooks indigenous cultures.
2. Identity Formation: Cultural heritage influences how moderate Native Americans form their identities, including their values, beliefs, and practices. It shapes their understanding of who they are and how they fit into the world around them.
3. Community Engagement: Cultural heritage fosters a sense of community engagement among moderate Native Americans. It provides a shared language, customs, and traditions that help build connections between individuals and communities, which is essential for building strong social bonds.
4. Resilience: Cultural heritage serves as a source of resilience for moderate Native Americans. It provides a way to navigate the challenges of living in a society that often marginalizes or overlooks indigenous cultures, and it helps individuals find strength and hope in their cultural practices and beliefs.
5. Cultural Preservation: Moderate Native Americans are committed to preserving their cultural heritage for future generations. This involves passing down traditional knowledge, customs, and practices to younger generations, as well as working to protect indigenous cultures
