Infant female early pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, can pose several challenges for both the mother and the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by infant females during this critical period:

1. Access to Healthcare: Many infants may not have access to proper prenatal care, which can lead to complications during pregnancy and delivery. In low-income communities or rural areas, access to healthcare facilities and trained professionals may be limited, making it difficult for expectant mothers to receive adequate care.
2. Lack of Knowledge: Many young mothers may not have received adequate education on pregnancy and childbirth, which can lead to a lack of understanding about prenatal care, fetal development, and birth complications.
