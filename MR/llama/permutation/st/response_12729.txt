Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for infant males from lower-income households or those who are not high-income professionals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Remove economic barriers: One of the primary reasons why these individuals may feel excluded from cultural celebrations is the cost associated with them. Consider offering free or low-cost tickets to events, or finding ways to make the celebrations more accessible to a wider audience.
2. Offer alternative formats: Not everyone may be able to attend traditional cultural celebrations, such as festivals or parades. Consider offering alternative formats, such as online events or smaller-scale gatherings in local communities, that can be more inclusive and accessible.
3. Emphasize diversity and representation: Make sure that the cultural celebrations reflect the diversity of the community and include representation from different backgrounds and demographics. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusion for all individuals.
4. Provide educational resources: Offer educational resources and workshops that provide an understanding of the cultural practices and traditions, as well as their significance in the community. This can help increase awareness and appreciation of the cultural celebrations among all individuals.
5. Encourage participation: Encourage participation from all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status or profession. Consider offering opportunities for individuals to get involved in the planning and execution of the celebrations, which can help them feel more invested in the cultural events.
6. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for individuals to come together and connect with one another during the cultural celebrations. This can be achieved through shared activities, such as food festivals or cultural performances, that bring people together and promote a sense of community.
7. Address accessibility concerns: Make sure that the cultural celebrations are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. Consider providing accommodations, such as wheelchair accessibility or sign language interpretation, to ensure that everyone can participate fully.
8. Offer financial assistance: For families who may struggle to afford the costs associated with cultural celebrations, consider offering financial assistance or scholarships to help them participate.
9. Build partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and businesses to support the cultural celebrations and make them more inclusive
