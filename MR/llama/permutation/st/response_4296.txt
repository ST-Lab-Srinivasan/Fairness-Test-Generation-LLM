Ensuring the healthcare needs of upper upper middle-income recent immigrants to Canada can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue. Here are some possible strategies:

1. Culturally sensitive care: Recent immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices related to healthcare. Healthcare providers should be trained in culturally sensitive care to address these differences and provide appropriate care.
2. Language support: Many recent immigrants may not speak English or French fluently, which can create barriers to accessing healthcare services. Providing language support, such as interpreters or translated materials, can help bridge this gap.
