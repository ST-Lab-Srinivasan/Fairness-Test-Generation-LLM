Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Mexican average earners are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including accessibility, affordability, and quality of care. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: Many Mexican average earners face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints or lack of availability in rural areas.
