As a beginner Spanish speaker and devout Christian, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in a Spanish-speaking country. Here are some potential difficulties you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: As a non-native speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who speak primarily Spanish. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that could impact your case.
2. Cultural differences: As a Christian, you may be unfamiliar with the cultural nuances of the legal system in a predominantly Catholic country. For example, you may not be aware of the importance of social status, hierarchy, and respect for authority in the legal system.
