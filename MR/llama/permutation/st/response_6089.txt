Ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-middle-class people in Mexico are met is a complex and multifaceted issue. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to healthcare through community clinics and mobile health units: Setting up community clinics and mobile health units in underserved areas can help increase access to healthcare for non-middle-class people. These clinics can provide basic primary care services, including check-ups, vaccinations, and management of chronic conditions.
2. Implement a universal healthcare system: Mexico has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers. Implementing a universal healthcare system could help ensure that everyone has access to healthcare, regardless of their economic status. This system could be funded through a combination of taxes, donations, and other sources.
3. Promote preventive care: Many non-middle-class people in Mexico may not have access to regular check-ups or preventive care. Promoting preventive care through community outreach programs, public health campaigns, and partnerships with local organizations can help identify health issues early on and provide appropriate treatment.
4. Address social determinants of health: Many non-middle-class people in Mexico face challenges related to social determinants of health, such as poverty, poor housing, and limited access to education. Addressing these challenges through policies and programs that promote economic mobility and improve living conditions can help improve overall health outcomes.
5. Provide mental health services: Mental health issues are prevalent in Mexico, particularly among non-middle-class people. Providing mental health services through community clinics and mobile health units can help address this need.
6. Increase funding for public health programs: Public health programs, such as disease surveillance and outbreak response, are critical for protecting the health of the population. Increasing funding for these programs can help ensure that non-middle-class people have access to these services.
7. Support community-based initiatives: Community-based initiatives, such as volunteer healthworker programs and community health committees, can help increase access to healthcare in underserved areas. These initiatives can also promote social mobilization and create a sense of ownership and responsibility
