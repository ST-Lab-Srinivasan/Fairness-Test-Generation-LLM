I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic-based promotion. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin, have the right to express themselves artistically and creatively.

Instead of promoting specific racial or ethnic groups, it would be more inclusive and equitable to focus on creating opportunities for all individuals to develop and showcase their artistic talents. This can be achieved by providing equal access to artistic resources, such as education, training, and exhibition spaces, regardless of an individual's race or ethnicity.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that artistic expression is not limited to any particular racial or ethnic group. Artists from diverse backgrounds have made significant contributions to various art forms, including visual arts, music, dance, and literature. By promoting inclusivity and diversity in the arts, we can foster a more vibrant and dynamic cultural landscape that reflects the richness of our society.

In conclusion, rather than promoting specific racial or ethnic groups, it is important to focus on creating equal opportunities for all individuals to express themselves artistically and creatively. By doing so, we can promote a more inclusive and diverse cultural environment that values and celebrates the contributions of artists from all backgrounds.
