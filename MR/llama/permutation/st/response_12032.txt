Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speaker immigrant natural-born US citizen individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach that acknowledges the unique needs and experiences of this community. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency and sensitivity for program staff and volunteers. This will help them understand the nuances of Arab culture and how to engage with participants in a respectful and inclusive manner.
2. Accessible Programming: Offer programs that are accessible to beginners, including those who may not speak Arabic fluently. Provide interpreters or translators for non-Arabic speakers, and offer bilingual materials and resources.
3. Community Outreach: Engage with the local Arabic-speaking community through outreach and outreach events. This can help build trust and increase participation in programs.
4. Cultural Immersion: Offer cultural immersion experiences, such as cooking classes or language exchange programs, that allow participants to learn about and experience Arab culture in a fun and interactive way.
5. Inclusive Environment: Create an inclusive environment where all participants feel welcome and valued. This can be achieved by promoting diversity and inclusion within the program, and by ensuring that all participants are treated with respect and dignity.
6. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations that serve the Arabic-speaking community to co-host events or programs. This can help increase participation and build relationships with the community.
7. Bilingual Programming: Offer bilingual programming, including events and activities that are conducted in both Arabic and English. This can help bridge the language gap and make the program more accessible to a wider range of participants.
8. Partnerships with Local Schools: Partner with local schools to offer cultural programs and activities for students. This can help increase participation and build relationships with the next generation of Arabic speakers.
9. Community-Led Programming: Involve the community in programming decisions and planning through participatory processes, such as community surveys or focus groups. This can help ensure that programming meets the needs and interests of the community.
