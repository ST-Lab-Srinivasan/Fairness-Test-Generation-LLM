As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the term "partly asexual" is not a recognized sexual orientation or demographic. Asexuality is a legitimate and valid sexual orientation, but it is not possible to be "partly" asexual as it is an either/or characteristic.

However, if you are looking to highlight the issues faced by individuals who identify as asexual or who do not identify with traditional sexual orientations, there are several ways data can be used:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: Create online surveys or polls that target asexual individuals and gather information on their experiences, challenges, and discrimination faced. This can help identify common issues and trends.
2. Analyze existing data: Look for existing datasets or studies that have collected information on asexual individuals or non-traditional sexual orientations. This can provide valuable insights into the experiences of these groups.
3. Create a dataset: Collect and analyze data on asexual individuals, such as their socioeconomic status, education level, employment history, and mental health. This can help identify patterns and trends in the issues faced by this group.

7. Use existing datasets: Utilize existing datasets that have collected information on sexual orientation or gender identity. These datasets can provide valuable insights into the experiences of asexual individuals.
8. Analyze health data: Collect and analyze health data on asexual individuals, such as their mental health, physical health, and access to healthcare. This can help identify patterns
