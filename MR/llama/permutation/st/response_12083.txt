To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Chinese speaker Nigerian individuals, you could consider the following steps:

1. Collect data: Gather data on the experiences and challenges faced by Nigerian individuals learning Chinese as beginners. This could include surveys, interviews, or observations of language learners in various settings (e.g., language schools, universities, online language communities).
2. Analyze data: Use statistical analysis or thematic coding to identify patterns and trends in the data you have collected. For example, you could analyze the frequency of certain challenges or issues faced by beginner Chinese learners, or compare the experiences of learners across different demographic groups (e.g., age, gender, location).
3. Visualize data: Use data visualization techniques to present your findings in a clear and accessible way. For example, you could create bar charts or scatter plots to illustrate the frequency of certain challenges, or create interactive maps to show the locations of language learners.
4. Interpret results: Analyze the results of your analysis and identify any key issues or challenges faced by beginner Chinese learner Nigerians. Consider potential factors that may contribute to these challenges, such as lack of resources, cultural differences, or individual learning styles.
5. Offer recommendations: Based on your findings, provide recommendations for addressing the identified issues and challenges. This could include suggestions for language teaching methods, materials, or resources that are tailored to the needs of beginner Chinese learners in Nigeria.
6. Share results: Finally, share your findings with relevant stakeholders, such as language teachers, learner advocacy groups, or government agencies responsible for language education. This could involve presenting your findings at conferences, workshops, or online platforms, or publishing them in research journals or language learning blogs.

Some potential data sources for this project could include:

1. Online language learning communities: Analyze discussion forums, chat rooms, or social media groups focused on Chinese language learners in Nigeria to identify common challenges and issues faced by beginner learners.
2. Language learning apps: Use data from language learning apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to track the progress and challenges of beginner Chinese learners in Nigeria.
