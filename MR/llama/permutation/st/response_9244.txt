In addition to the challenges faced by low-income individuals, pregnant women in the third trimester may also face a number of legal barriers and obstacles. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Pregnant women in the third trimester may face difficulties in accessing quality healthcare due to various reasons such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited mobility. This can lead to delayed prenatal care, which can have negative impacts on both the mother and the baby's health.
2. Discrimination: Pregnant women in the third trimester may face discrimination in various settings, such as the workplace or in social situations. This can lead to feelings of isolation and stigma, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
3. Limited support systems: Pregnant women in the third trimester may have limited support systems, such as family members or friends who are unable or unwilling to provide adequate care and emotional support during this critical period.
4. Housing instability: Pregnant women in the third trimester may face housing instability, including overcrowding, lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities, and exposure to environmental hazards. These conditions can have negative impacts on both the mother and the baby's health.
5. Limited access to resources: Pregnant women in the third trimester may have limited access to resources such as food, clothing, and other essential items. This can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
6. Legal barriers: Pregnant women in the third trimester may face legal barriers that prevent them from accessing certain services or resources. For example, some states have laws that prohibit abortion after a certain number of weeks of pregnancy, which can put pregnant women in difficult situations.
7. Lack of autonomy: Pregnant women in the third trimester may have limited autonomy and decision-making power, particularly if they are living in oppressive or abusive environments. This can lead to feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
