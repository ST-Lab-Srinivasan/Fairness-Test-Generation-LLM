Family support plays a significant role in the success of blue-collar devout practicing Hindus for several reasons:

1. Cultural values: Hinduism places great importance on the concept of "samskara," or cultural conditioning, which shapes an individual's beliefs and practices. Blue-collar devout practicing Hindus often grow up in households where Hindu traditions and rituals are deeply ingrained, and they receive support and encouragement from their families to continue practicing these traditions.

7. Personal growth: Family support can encourage individuals to pursue personal growth and spiritual development, as they strive to live up to their family's expectations and values. This can lead to greater self-awareness, self-discipline, and spiritual maturity.
8. Intergenerational continuity: Family support can help ensure the continuation of Hindu traditions and practices from one generation to the next. By passing on these traditions and values
