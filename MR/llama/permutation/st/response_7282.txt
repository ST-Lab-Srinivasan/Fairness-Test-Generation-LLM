Ensuring the educational needs of individuals with no known genetic conditions, also known as non-diagnostic individuals or individuals with unexplained genetic findings, can be challenging. These individuals may have unique learning needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional special education models. Here are some strategies to help meet their educational needs:

1. Collaboration with medical professionals: Work closely with geneticists, pediatricians, and other medical professionals to gather more information about the individual's condition. This can help identify specific learning needs and inform educational planning.
