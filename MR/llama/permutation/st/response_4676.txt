There are several challenges that non-high-income professional immigrant recent immigrants to the US may face when accessing healthcare in the US. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many non-high-income professional immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can create communication difficulties when trying to navigate the healthcare system or communicate with healthcare providers.
