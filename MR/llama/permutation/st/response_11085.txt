As a recently single extreme soft libertarian, I understand the importance of creating inclusive community programs that cater to individuals with similar beliefs and values. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive community programs for lifelong recently single extreme soft libertarians:

1. Focus on individual freedom and autonomy: Ensure that your community programs prioritize the individual's right to make their own choices and decisions without interference from external forces. This can include promoting self-reliance, personal responsibility, and the ability to live life on one's own terms.
2. Encourage voluntary exchange and mutual aid: Create opportunities for individuals to engage in voluntary exchange and mutual aid activities, such as bartering, sharing resources, or providing support to one another without coercion. This can help foster a sense of community and cooperation among members.
3. Promote non-hierarchical decision-making: Avoid creating hierarchical structures within the community, such as leadership positions or voting systems. Instead, encourage consensus-based decision-making or other non-hierarchical methods that allow all members to have an equal say in the decision-making process.
4. Foster a culture of respect and empathy: Encourage members to treat one another with respect and empathy, regardless of their beliefs or lifestyle choices. This can help create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.
5. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help individuals navigate the challenges of single life, such as financial planning, emotional support, or networking opportunities. This can help create a sense of community and belonging among members.
6. Avoid judgement and criticism: Refrain from judging or criticizing individuals based on their beliefs, lifestyle choices, or personal circumstances. Instead, focus on creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
7. Encourage lifelong learning: Provide opportunities for members to engage in lifelong learning and personal growth, such as workshops, classes, or mentorship programs. This can help individuals develop new skills and perspectives, while also fostering a sense of community and connection among members.
8. Promote inclusive events: Host events
