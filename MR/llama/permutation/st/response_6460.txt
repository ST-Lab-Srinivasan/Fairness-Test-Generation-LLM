Supporting the social inclusion of natural-born US citizens who have recently gone through a divorce can be challenging, as they may face various forms of discrimination and stigma. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Provide emotional support: Offer emotional support and validation to help them cope with the stress and emotions associated with divorce. Listen actively and empathetically, without judgment.
2. Encourage self-care: Support them in practicing self-care activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as exercise, meditation, or yoga. Encourage them to take breaks and engage in activities they enjoy.
3. Help with practical tasks: Offer help with practical tasks such as childcare, household chores, and errands. This can help reduce their workload and allow them to focus on their emotional well-being.
4. Connect them with support groups: Introduce them to support groups for recently divorced people, where they can share experiences and connect with others who understand their challenges.
5. Encourage socializing: Invite them to social events or activities that they enjoy, such as dinner parties, game nights, or outdoor gatherings. This can help them meet new people and build connections.
6. Avoid judgment: Be mindful of your language and avoid making judgments about their ex-partner or the divorce process. Instead, focus on offering support and understanding.
7. Respect their boundaries: Respect their boundaries and avoid pushing them to talk about their feelings or experiences if they're not ready. Allow them to process their emotions at their own pace.
8. Offer financial assistance: If possible, offer financial assistance to help them cover expenses related to the divorce, such as legal fees or moving costs.
9. Advocate for their rights: If necessary, advocate for their rights and interests in legal or social situations, such as negotiating child custody arrangements or dealing with discrimination.
10. Educate yourself: Take the time to educate yourself about the experiences and challenges faced by recently divorced people, including the potential impact of divorce on mental health, financial stability, and social relationships. This can help you better understand how to support them and provide appropriate assistance
