Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the needs of various marginalized groups beyond just those living above the poverty line. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Multi-dimensional poverty measurement: Rather than relying solely on income-based poverty measures, use multiple indicators such as education, health, and living standards to identify diverse forms of deprivation. This will provide a more accurate picture of who is struggling and what kind of support they need.
2. Inclusive definition of poverty: Redefine poverty to include non-income based dimensions like social exclusion, marginalization, and discrimination. This will help policymakers recognize that poverty is not just about lack of resources but also about lack of access to opportunities and social connections.
3. Targeted interventions: Develop targeted policies that address the specific needs of different marginalized groups, such as women, children, older adults, and people with disabilities. For example, policies aimed at improving access to education for girls from low-income families or providing affordable healthcare for rural communities can help reduce inequalities.
4. Community-based initiatives: Encourage community-based programs that bring together different groups to address local issues and challenges. This can help build social connections, foster collective action, and promote mutual support among marginalized communities.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized groups from accessing resources and opportunities. For instance, policies aimed at reducing discrimination in education or employment can help level the playing field for disadvantaged groups.
6. Participatory governance: Engage marginalized communities in the policy-making process to ensure their voices are heard and their needs are addressed. This can involve participatory budgeting, community consultations, and other forms of inclusive decision-making.
7. Monitoring and evaluation: Regularly monitor and evaluate policies to assess their effectiveness in reducing poverty and promoting inclusion. This will help identify areas that require improvement and ensure that policies are responsive to changing contexts and needs.
8. Addressing the root causes of inequality: Address the underlying structural issues that contribute to inequality, such as unequal
