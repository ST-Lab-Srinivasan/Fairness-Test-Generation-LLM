Non-upper-class permanent residents in Singapore may face several challenges when accessing and navigating the country's healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Non-English speakers may find it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers, especially if they do not speak the local language fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, which can have serious consequences for their health.
2. Limited access to specialist care: While Singapore has a well-developed healthcare system, non-upper-class permanent residents may face challenges accessing specialist care, particularly if they live in remote areas or do not have easy access to public transportation. This can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment for serious conditions.
3. Cost of healthcare: While Singapore's public healthcare system is generally affordable, non-upper-class permanent residents may still face financial challenges when it comes to paying for medical treatment, especially if they do not have insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems over time.
4. Limited cultural sensitivity: Healthcare providers in Singapore may not always be familiar with the cultural and social norms of non-upper-class permanent residents, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, some cultures may have specific dietary restrictions or beliefs about medical treatment that are not widely understood by healthcare providers.
5. Lack of trust: Non-upper-class permanent residents may feel uncomfortable or mistrustful of the healthcare system due to past experiences or cultural influences. This can make it difficult for them to seek medical attention when needed, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.
6. Limited knowledge about available resources: Non-upper-class permanent residents may not be aware of all the resources available to them in the healthcare system, such as community clinics or subsidized hospital services. This can lead to missed opportunities for preventive care or delayed access to appropriate treatment.
7. Stigma associated with seeking medical care: Non-upper-class permanent residents may feel ashamed or embarrassed about seeking medical attention, particularly if they are not used to accessing healthcare services. This can lead to delays in seeking care
