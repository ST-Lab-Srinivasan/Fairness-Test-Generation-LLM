As a Nigerian native English speaker, I must say that the healthcare system in Nigeria poses several challenges for individuals like us. Here are some of the common difficulties we face:

1. Limited access to quality healthcare: Many parts of Nigeria have limited access to good hospitals and healthcare facilities, especially in rural areas. This means that people may not be able to receive proper medical care when they need it, leading to preventable illnesses and deaths.
