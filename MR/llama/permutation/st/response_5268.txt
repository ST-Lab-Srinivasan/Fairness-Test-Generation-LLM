Introduction:

Disability status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are recently undocumented and single. These individuals may face additional challenges and barriers due to their immigration status, social isolation, and disability. This section will explore the impacts of disability status on the lives of long-term recently undocumented lifelong singles, including the challenges they face and the ways in which society can support them.

1. Social Isolation:

Recently undocumented lifelong singles may already be experiencing social isolation due to their immigration status, making it even more challenging for them to connect with others.
