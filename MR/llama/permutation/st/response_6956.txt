As a long-term widowed person, you may face several challenges in the job market as a native English speaker. Here are some of the common obstacles you might encounter:

1. Stereotypes and biases: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being a widow or widower, especially if you are a woman. Some employers may hold biases against you based on your marital status, which can limit your job opportunities.
2. Limited social network: After losing a spouse, your social network may shrink significantly, which can make it harder to find job opportunities or get referrals from contacts in your industry.
3. Career gap: If you have taken time off to care for children or manage household duties after your spouse's passing, you may face challenges in finding a job that matches your previous career level or salary expectations. This is especially true if you have been out of the workforce for an extended period.
4. Age discrimination: As a long-term widow/er, you may be perceived as older than your peers, which can lead to age discrimination in the job market. Even if you are still energetic and capable of performing tasks, some employers may be hesitant to hire someone who is closer to retirement age.
5. Emotional challenges: Losing a spouse can take an emotional toll on you, which can affect your confidence and motivation in the job market. It may be harder for you to focus or perform at your best in interviews or job roles, especially if you are still grieving.
6. Financial challenges: As a widow/er, you may face financial difficulties, especially if your spouse was the primary breadwinner. This can make it harder for you to find a well-paying job that can support yourself and any dependents.
7. Limited job opportunities: Depending on where you live, there may be limited job opportunities in certain industries or fields, which can make it harder for you to find work that matches your skills and experience.
8. Lack of flexible work arrangements: Many employers may not offer flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or part-time work, which can be challenging if you have caregiving responsibilities
