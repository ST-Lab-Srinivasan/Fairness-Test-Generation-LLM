Introduction:
Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are in the third trimester of pregnancy. Infant female individuals who are recent immigrants or undocumented may face unique challenges that can affect their health and well-being during this critical period. This study aims to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of infant female people in the third trimester of pregnancy.

 Literature Review:
Several studies have shown that immigrant women face barriers in accessing healthcare services, particularly those who are undocumented. These barriers can include language and cultural differences, lack of knowledge about the healthcare system, and fear of deportation (1,2). Additionally, immigrant women may experience discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status, which can affect their mental health and well-being (3).

During pregnancy, the immigration status of a woman can have significant consequences on her health and the health of her unborn child. For example, undocumented immigrants may be less likely to receive prenatal care due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare services (4). This can result in delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can lead to pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes (5).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design to explore the experiences of infant female people in the third trimester of pregnancy who are recent immigrants or undocumented. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of 15 participants, including immigrant women and their partners. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that the immigration status of a woman during pregnancy can have significant impacts on her health and well-being, as well as that of her unborn child. Participants reported experiencing stress and anxiety due to their immigration status, which can affect the health of both themselves and their unborn children (6). Additionally, participants expressed concerns about accessing healthcare services during pregnancy, including prenatal care and delivery (7).

Conclusion:
