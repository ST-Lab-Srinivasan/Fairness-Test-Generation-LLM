As a general rule, long-term married couples who hold temporary visas face various challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of Legal Recognition: Unlike permanent residents or citizens, temporary visa holders often have limited rights and privileges under the law. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system, particularly when it comes to matters such as property rights, inheritance, and taxation.
2. Limited Access to Legal Aid: Many long-term married couples may not be eligible for legal aid or other forms of government support due to their temporary resident status. This can make it even more challenging for them to obtain the legal assistance they need.
3. Difficulty in Obtaining a Permanent Residency: The pathway to permanent residency can be complex and time-consuming, particularly for long-term married couples who may face additional hurdles due to their temporary visa status. They may have to wait longer or meet additional requirements to qualify for permanent residency.
4. Uncertainty about Future Residency Status: Long-term married couples holding temporary visas may face uncertainty about their future residency status, which can impact their ability to make long-term plans and decisions about their lives together.
5. Difficulty in Accessing Healthcare Services: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to publicly funded healthcare services or may face additional costs or barriers when accessing medical care. This can be particularly challenging for long-term married couples who may require ongoing medical attention.
6. Limited Employment Opportunities: Long-term married couples holding temporary visas may have limited job opportunities due to their immigration status, which can impact their ability to support themselves and their families.
7. Difficulty in Obtaining Financial Support: Temporary visa holders may face challenges when it comes to obtaining financial support from government agencies or other organizations due to their immigration status.
8. Limited Access to Education Services: Long-term married couples holding temporary visas may have limited access to education services, including language training or vocational programs, which can impact their ability to acquire new skills and knowledge
