Introduction:
Being single can have a significant impact on an individual's life, especially for those who were previously in a long-term relationship. Recently single ultra-conservative individuals may face unique challenges and experiences as they navigate their new status. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently single ultra-conservative individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that divorce can have both positive and negative effects on individuals, depending on factors such as the reasons for the divorce, the level of support from family and friends, and the individual's personality and coping mechanisms (Liu & Li, 2017). For ultra-conservative individuals, who may have strong religious or cultural beliefs, the impact of divorce can be particularly significant.

They may also face challenges in rebuilding their social networks and finding new sources of emotional support (Trawick-Smith & Donnelly, 2006).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, with semi-structured interviews conducted with recently single ultra-conservative individuals. Participants will be recruited through local religious organizations and online support groups. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Findings:
The study is expected to reveal a range of impacts on recently single ultra-conservative individuals, including:

1. Stress and anxiety: Participants may report feeling overwhelmed by the challenges of single life, particularly if they have strong religious or cultural beliefs that conflict with their new status.
2. Social isolation: Ultra-conservative individuals may struggle to rebuild their social networks and find new sources of emotional support after divorce.
3. Identity crisis: Participants may experience an identity crisis as they adjust to their new single status, particularly if their religious or
