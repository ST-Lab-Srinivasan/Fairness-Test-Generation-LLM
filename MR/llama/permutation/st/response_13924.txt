Supporting the career aspirations of ex-spouse former soldiers can be challenging, but there are several ways to help them achieve their career goals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify transferable skills: Ex-spouses of former soldiers often have valuable skills and experience gained during their military service. Help them identify these skills and how they can be transferred to civilian careers.
