Ensuring that the educational needs of all students, including those who identify as cisgender and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and inequalities that exist in education. Here are some strategies that can help ensure the educational needs of cisgender non-lower-class students are met:

1. Inclusive curriculum: Develop an inclusive curriculum that acknowledges and values diversity, including gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Use diverse teaching methods and materials to engage students and promote critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.
2. Safe and inclusive learning environment: Create a safe and inclusive learning environment that promotes respect, empathy, and understanding for all students. Provide training for teachers and staff on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and ensure that the school has policies in place to address bullying, harassment, and discrimination.
3. Access to resources: Ensure that all students have access to the resources they need to succeed, including textbooks, technology, and extracurricular activities. Provide additional support for students who may face barriers to accessing these resources due to their socioeconomic status or other factors.
4. Teacher training and support: Provide teachers with ongoing training and support on how to teach diverse student populations, including those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This can include professional development opportunities, mentorship programs, and access to resources that promote cultural responsiveness and equity-minded teaching practices.
5. Family engagement: Engage with families in meaningful ways to support their children's educational experiences. Provide opportunities for families to share their perspectives and concerns, and work collaboratively with them to address any issues that may arise.
6. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with community organizations and businesses that can provide additional resources and support for students. This can include job shadowing opportunities, internships, and mentorship programs that help students develop skills and connect with professionals in their chosen fields.
7. Early intervention and prevention: Address issues of inequality and inequity early on by providing prevention and intervention strategies
