The impact of marital status on the lives of physically disabled native Spanish speaker individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Marriage can provide a sense of belonging and social support, which may be particularly important for individuals with disabilities who may face discrimination or stigma in their daily lives.
