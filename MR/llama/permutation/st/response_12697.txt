The impact of immigration status on the lives of upper, lower, middle, and extreme, moderate, or liberal people can vary greatly depending on the specific context and circumstances. Here are some possible effects:

1. Access to basic needs: In many countries, people with precarious immigration status may face barriers in accessing basic necessities like food, shelter, healthcare, and education. They may be unable to access government-provided services or may have to rely on informal networks for support.
2. Employment and economic stability: People without legal immigration status may face restrictions in finding employment or starting a business, leading to economic instability and poverty. They may also be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in the workplace.
3. Social exclusion: Discrimination based on immigration status can lead to social isolation, stigma, and marginalization, which can negatively impact mental health and well-being.
4. Legal rights and protections: People with precarious immigration status may have limited access to legal rights and protections, making them more vulnerable to violence, abuse, and exploitation.
5. Family separation: Precarious immigration status can lead to family separation, as individuals may be unable to sponsor their loved ones for immigration or face deportation.
6. Healthcare access: People with precarious immigration status may have limited access to healthcare services, which can exacerbate existing health conditions and lead to poorer health outcomes.
7. Educational opportunities: Precarious immigration status can limit access to educational opportunities, leading to a lack of skills and knowledge that can hinder social mobility.
8. Community involvement: Discrimination based on immigration status can lead to a lack of community involvement and engagement, which can further exacerbate feelings of isolation and marginalization.
9. Political participation: Precarious immigration status can limit political participation, as individuals may be unable to vote or run for public office due to their immigration status.
