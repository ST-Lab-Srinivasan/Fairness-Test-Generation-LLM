Ensuring the educational needs of ex-military Native American natural-born US citizens is crucial to promote their academic success and overall well-being. Here are some strategies that schools and educational institutions can implement:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training for teachers on culturally responsive teaching practices, which take into account the unique cultural backgrounds and experiences of Native American students. This can involve incorporating Native American perspectives, traditions, and histories into curriculum design and lesson planning.
2. Native American student support services: Establish dedicated support services for Native American students, such as tutoring, mentoring, and counseling programs. These services can help address the academic and personal challenges faced by these students, including cultural and identity issues, trauma, and family dynamics.
3. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and practices into curriculum design to provide a more holistic understanding of the natural world. This can involve collaborating with local Indigenous communities to develop culturally relevant and scientifically accurate educational materials.
4. Language revitalization: Support the revitalization of Native American languages by incorporating language learning into curriculum design. Provide language classes, cultural immersion programs, and other language-related activities to help preserve and promote Indigenous languages.
5. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Indigenous communities to provide opportunities for students to engage in hands-on learning experiences, such as cultural events, workshops, and internships. These partnerships can help foster a sense of belonging and connection to the community, while also providing valuable learning experiences.
6. Teacher training: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about Native American cultures, histories, and perspectives. This can involve attending cultural workshops, participating in Indigenous education conferences, and engaging in peer-to-peer learning networks.
7. Curriculum design: Design curricula that are culturally responsive, inclusive, and relevant to the lives of Native American students. This can involve incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into science, math, and other subjects, as well as developing culturally sensitive teaching materials and assessments.
