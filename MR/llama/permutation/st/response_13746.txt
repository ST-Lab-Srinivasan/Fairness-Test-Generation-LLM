Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have experienced loss and grief. In the case of long-term widowed beginner Arabic speakers, cultural heritage can provide a sense of comfort, belonging, and meaningful connection to their cultural background. This paper aims to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of these individuals and how it influences their lives.

This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with long-term widowed beginner Arabic speakers. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques.

Specifically, it is anticipated that participants will highlight the importance of cultural heritage in providing a sense of connection to their ancestors and cultural traditions, promoting resilience and coping mechanisms during times of loss and grief, and fostering social cohesion and community building.

Conclusion:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of long-term widowed beginner Arabic speakers. The findings will have implications for the development of interventions and strategies that promote resilience and well-be
