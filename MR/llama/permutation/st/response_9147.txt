Having diverse perspectives from individuals who are recent immigrants to the US, especially those who are over the age of 65, can bring numerous benefits to leadership roles. Here are some potential advantages:

1. Unique Life Experiences: Recent immigrants have lived experiences that are vastly different from those of their American-born counterparts. They bring with them a wealth of knowledge and perspectives gained from their home countries, cultures, and communities. These experiences can enrich the decision-making process in leadership roles, fostering creativity, innovation, and inclusivity.

This exposure can help them navigate complex social dynamics within the organization and foster a deeper understanding of diverse employee populations.

These experiences can help them develop high emotional intelligence, empathy, and resilience, which are critical skills for effective leadership.
