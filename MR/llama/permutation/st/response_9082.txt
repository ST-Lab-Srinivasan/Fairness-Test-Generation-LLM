As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or feelings. However, I can provide some general advice on how to support the professional aspirations of beginner English speakers who are recently pregnant (in their third trimester). Here are a few suggestions:

1. Encourage and motivate them: Pregnancy can be an exciting time, but it can also be challenging for beginners who may struggle with the added demands of caring for a newborn. Encourage and motivate them to keep pushing forward, even if they are feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about their future career goals.
2. Offer flexible work arrangements: As a beginner English speaker in their third trimester, they may need more flexibility in their work schedule to accommodate their changing physical needs during pregnancy. Offering flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, flexible hours, or job sharing can help them manage their workload while also taking care of themselves and their baby.
3. Provide resources and support: Pregnant individuals may need additional resources and support to help them navigate the challenges of pregnancy and new motherhood. Offer to provide access to prenatal yoga classes, birthing classes, or other resources that can help them prepare for childbirth and manage their physical and emotional well-being during this time.
4. Create a safe space: Creating a safe and supportive environment can go a long way in helping beginner English speakers feel comfortable and confident as they navigate their pregnancy and new motherhood. Encourage them to express their feelings and concerns without fear of judgment, and offer emotional support and encouragement along the way.
5. Help them set realistic goals: As a beginner English speaker in their third trimester, they may need help setting realistic career goals that take into account their changing physical abilities during pregnancy. Encourage them to set achievable goals for themselves, such as completing a specific project or task before the baby arrives, and offer support and guidance along the way.
6. Provide networking opportunities: Networking can be an excellent way for beginner English speakers to connect with other professionals in their field and learn from their experiences. Offer to introduce them to other professionals who may be able to provide advice or support during this time
