The Nigerian healthcare system faces a number of challenges when it comes to serving the country's large population of native Arabic speakers. Here are some of the specific challenges that have been identified:

Language barriers: Many native Arabic speakers in Nigeria may not speak English, which can create difficulties in accessing healthcare services, particularly in areas where English is the dominant language.
