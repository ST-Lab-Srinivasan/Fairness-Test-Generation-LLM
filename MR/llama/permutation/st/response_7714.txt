To highlight the issues faced by unemployed Mexican individuals using data, you could follow these steps:

1. Identify the key indicators: Start by identifying the most relevant and reliable data sources that can provide insights into the employment situation in Mexico. Some examples of key indicators could include:
	* Unemployment rates: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking work.
	* Labor force participation rate: The percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking work.
	* Employment-to-population ratio: The percentage of the population that is employed.
	* Wages and income: Data on average wages and income can help illustrate the economic challenges faced by unemployed individuals.
2. Analyze the data: Once you have identified the key indicators, analyze the data to identify trends and patterns. For example:
	* Are there any seasonal fluctuations in employment rates?

	* Are there any differences in wages and income between different groups?
3. Visualize the data: Use data visualization tools to present the data in a clear and easy-to-understand format. For example:
	* Create a line chart to show how unemployment rates have changed over time.
	* Use a bar chart to compare the labor force participation rate across different demographics.
	* Create a scatter plot to examine the relationship between wages and income.
4. Interpret the findings: Once you have analyzed and visualized the data, interpret the findings in the context of the issues faced by unemployed Mexican individuals. For example:
	* Are there any patterns or trends that suggest that unemployment rates are higher than they should be given the size of the labor force?
	* How do the wages and income of unemployed individuals compare to national averages, and what does this tell us about the economic challenges faced by these individuals?
