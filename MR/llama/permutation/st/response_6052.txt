Addressing the Needs of Partly Asexual Devout Muslims in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
As a disaster response organization, it is essential to consider the diverse needs of all individuals affected by a disaster, including those who identify as partly asexual devout Muslims. These individuals may have unique cultural and religious practices that can impact their immediate and long-term needs after a disaster. This document outlines how disaster response organizations can address the needs of partly asexual devout Muslim individuals in disaster response.

1. Understand the Concept of Asexuality:
Asexuality is a sexual orientation where an individual does not experience sexual attraction or desire.

This includes respecting their decision to abstain from sexual activities during the disaster response and recovery phases. Organizations should ensure that their relief efforts do not inadvertently promote sexual activities or create uncomfortable situations for these individuals.
3. Provide Gender-Separate Facilities:
In many Muslim cultures, it is important to provide gender-separate facilities, particularly during the post-disaster phase when individuals may be sharing living spaces. This can help partly asexual devout Muslim individuals feel more comfortable and secure in their surroundings. Disaster response organizations should make arrangements for separate male and female facilities, such as sleeping quarters or bathrooms, to accommodate these needs.

Disaster response organizations should offer non-sexualized assistance to partly asexual devout Muslim individuals.

Organizations should avoid using language or imagery that could be perceived as sexually charged or inappropriate.
