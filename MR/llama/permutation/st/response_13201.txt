Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of non-liberal individuals can vary greatly depending on cultural and societal norms. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of non-liberal individuals who have been married for less than five years.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and social recognition (Waite & Gallagher, 2000). On the other hand, it can also lead to a loss of identity, autonomy, and social isolation (Tillman & Simon, 1987). Non-liberal individuals may experience additional challenges in navigating these impacts due to cultural and societal expectations surrounding marriage.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with 20 non-liberal individuals who have been married for less than five years. Participants will be recruited through local community centers and religious organizations. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of non-liberal individuals. Many participants reported feeling pressure to conform to traditional gender roles within their marriage, which can lead to feelings of frustration and disempowerment (e.g., "I feel like I'm not allowed to have my own opinions or make decisions without my husband's approval"). Others reported experiencing social isolation due to the stigma surrounding non-liberal marriages (e.g., "My friends and family don't understand why I married someone from a different culture, so they distance themselves from me").

Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the complex impacts of marital status on the lives of non-liberal individuals. While marriage can provide emotional support and financial stability, it can also lead to a loss of identity and autonomy. Culturally and societally induced pressures can exacerbate these
