The role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of newly married individuals, including those who are native English speakers, is significant. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. This can include religious beliefs, cultural traditions, language, and social norms.

For newly married individuals, their cultural heritage can play a crucial role in shaping their identities in several ways:
