The impact of marital status on an individual's life can be significant, and this is especially true for those who have been married for a long time but are not widowed. Here are some potential impacts of marital status on the lives of non-libertarian individuals:

1. Emotional Support: Marriage provides emotional support to individuals, which can help them navigate life's challenges more effectively. Being married for a long time can strengthen this support network, providing a sense of security and stability. Non-libertarians may rely on their spouse for emotional support, which can be particularly important during difficult times.
