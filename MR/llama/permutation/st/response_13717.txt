Cultural competence in healthcare refers to the ability of healthcare providers to understand and respect the cultural practices, values, and beliefs of patients from diverse backgrounds. This is particularly important when caring for reservist middle-class people, who may have unique cultural experiences and expectations that are different from those of other patient populations. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for reservist middle-class people:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers communicate more effectively with reservist middle-class patients, who may have different communication styles and expectations. For example, reservist middle-class individuals may prefer a more direct and assertive communication style, while others may prefer a more reserved and polite approach.
