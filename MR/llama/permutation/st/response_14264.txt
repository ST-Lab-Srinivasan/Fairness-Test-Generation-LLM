Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty poor people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible to all, including those with disabilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
2. Affordability: Offer free or low-cost admission to active-duty poor people. This can be achieved through partnerships with local businesses or organizations that are willing to donate resources.
3. Outreach: Reach out to local military bases, veterans' organizations, and poverty organizations to spread the word about the event. Utilize social media platforms and flyers to reach a wider audience.
4. Inclusive programming: Offer programs that cater to the diverse needs and interests of active-duty poor people. This can include workshops on financial management, job skills training, mental health support, and cultural events that celebrate diversity.
5. Childcare and transportation: Provide childcare services and transportation options to ensure that parents can attend the event without worrying about their children's care or transportation.
6. Food and beverages: Offer free or low-cost food and beverages, including healthy meals and snacks, to ensure that everyone can participate without financial strain.
7. Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow attendees to connect with one another, such as group games, art projects, and community service opportunities.
8. Cultural representation: Ensure that the event reflects the diversity of the active-duty poor population. This can be achieved by incorporating music, dance, and other cultural performances that celebrate different backgrounds and identities.
9. Access to resources: Provide access to local resources, such as healthcare services, job fairs, and legal clinics, to ensure that attendees have the support they need to improve their lives.
10. Follow-up: After the event, follow up with attendees to ensure that they are receiving the support and resources they need. This can be achieved through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one meetings.
