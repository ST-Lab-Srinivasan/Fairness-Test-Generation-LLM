Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers with mixed Hispanic heritage can be achieved by incorporating elements that reflect their diverse backgrounds and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate music, art, and literature from different Latin American countries: Mixed Hispanics have ancestry from multiple countries in Latin America, so including content from various regions will make the program more relatable and engaging for them. For example, you could include music from Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, or feature artwork from Brazil, Dominican Republic, and Peru.
2. Use bilingual materials: Provide educational resources in both Spanish and the individual's primary language to accommodate learners who may not be fluent in Spanish yet. This will help them feel more comfortable and engaged in the program.
3. Offer cultural immersion experiences: Plan activities that allow participants to learn about Hispanic cultures through direct experience, such as cooking classes, dance workshops, or visits to local festivals and events. This will help them connect with their heritage in a more meaningful way.
4. Involve mixed Hispanics in the planning process: Encourage individuals with mixed Hispanic backgrounds to contribute to the development of cultural programs. This will ensure that the content is relevant and appealing to their communities, fostering a sense of ownership and pride in the program.
5. Provide opportunities for participants to share their experiences: Create safe spaces for individuals to discuss their identities, traditions, and cultural practices. This can help build connections within the community and promote understanding among participants.
6. Celebrate diverse holidays and celebrations: Incorporate festivals and events from different Latin American countries into the program, such as Day of the Dead (Mexico), Carnaval (Brazil), or Three Kings' Day (Puerto Rico). This will allow participants to learn about and appreciate various cultural traditions.
7. Offer language classes tailored to mixed Hispanics: Provide language instruction that caters to individuals with diverse linguistic backgrounds, including those who speak indigenous languages or have learned Spanish as a second language.
8. Create intergenerational connections: Encourage older and younger generations of mixed Hispanics to participate in cultural programs together
