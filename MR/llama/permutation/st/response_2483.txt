As a respondent, I understand that you are looking for ways to address the needs of non-libertarian individuals who have been married for a longer period of time during disaster response. Here are some potential strategies that could be effective:

1. Inclusive Communication: Ensure that communication channels are inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of their political beliefs or marital status. Provide regular updates on the situation, response efforts, and resources available through various channels, such as social media, text messages, or community meetings.
2. Community-Led Response: Encourage community members to take an active role in disaster response and recovery efforts. This can involve organizing volunteer groups, distributing supplies, or providing emotional support to those affected by the disaster. By involving the community in the response process, you can help build trust and social capital, which can be particularly important for non-libertarian individuals who may feel marginalized or excluded from decision-making processes.
3. Prioritize Vulnerable Populations: Identify and prioritize the needs of vulnerable populations, such as older adults, children, and those with disabilities. This can involve providing additional support and resources to these groups, such as evacuation assistance, shelter, or medical care. By addressing the specific needs of these populations, you can help ensure that they are better equipped to cope with the effects of the disaster.
4. Foster Social Support: Encourage social support networks within communities to help individuals cope with the emotional impacts of disasters. This can involve organizing community events, facilitating peer support groups, or providing access to mental health resources. By fostering social connections and support networks, you can help individuals feel less isolated and more resilient in the face of adversity.
5. Involve Traditional Leaders: Involve traditional leaders and decision-makers from affected communities in disaster response and recovery efforts. This can involve working with tribal elders, religious leaders, or community volunteers to help identify needs and prioritize resources. By involving these leaders in the response process, you can help build trust and legitimacy within the community, which can be particularly important for non-libertarian individuals who may feel marginalized or excluded from decision-making processes
