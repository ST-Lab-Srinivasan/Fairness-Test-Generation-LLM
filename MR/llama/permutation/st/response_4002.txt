Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers with mixed Hispanic heritage are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to create an inclusive and equitable environment. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and comfortable environment where everyone feels free to share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by setting ground rules for the discussion, such as active listening, respectful communication, and open-mindedness.
2. Use inclusive language: Adopt language that is inclusive and respectful of all participants, regardless of their background or identity. Avoid using terms that stereotype or marginalize any particular group.
3. Build trust: Establish a rapport with the participants by showing genuine interest in their perspectives and experiences. This can be done through active listening, asking open-ended questions, and providing opportunities for informal networking.
4. Provide support: Offer language support or interpretation services to ensure that all participants can fully engage in the discussion. This can help level the playing field and ensure that everyone's voice is heard.
5. Foster collaboration: Encourage participants to work together towards a common goal, rather than competing against each other. This can be done by facilitating small group discussions or brainstorming sessions, where participants can share their ideas and build on each other's thoughts.
6. Use visual aids: Incorporate visual aids such as diagrams, maps, or infographics to help explain complex ideas and make them more accessible to all participants. This can help bridge language gaps and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
7. Provide opportunities for feedback: Encourage participants to share their thoughts and concerns throughout the decision-making process. This can be done through regular check-ins, surveys, or focus groups, which can help identify potential issues and address them proactively.
8. Leverage technology: Utilize digital tools such as video conferencing, instant messaging, or online forums to facilitate communication and collaboration among participants. This can help overcome language barriers and ensure that everyone has equal access to the decision-making process.
9. Develop cultural competency: Provide training or workshops
