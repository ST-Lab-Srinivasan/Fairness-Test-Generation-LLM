Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for immigrant and recent immigrant Orthodox Jewish individuals in the United States requires understanding, empathy, and a willingness to adapt traditions to accommodate their beliefs and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite Orthodox Jewish community members to participate in the planning of cultural celebrations to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account. This can help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity.
2. Be mindful of dietary restrictions: Many Orthodox Jews follow strict kosher dietary laws, so make sure to provide kosher food options at cultural celebrations. This can be as simple as labeling foods that are kosher and those that are not, or providing separate kosher and non-kosher food options.
3. Be respectful of religious practices: Allow Orthodox Jewish individuals to observe their religious practices during cultural celebrations. For example, provide a designated area for men and women to pray separately, or allow them to wear traditional attire during cultural events.
4. Provide educational opportunities: Offer workshops or classes on the customs and traditions of Orthodox Judaism before cultural celebrations. This can help non-Orthodox individuals understand the beliefs and practices of their guests, leading to a more inclusive and respectful atmosphere.
5. Create cross-cultural exchange opportunities: Organize events that bring together members of different cultural backgrounds to learn from each other and share traditions. This can help foster understanding and mutual respect between different communities.
6. Be open to feedback: Encourage Orthodox Jewish individuals to provide feedback on how cultural celebrations can be made more inclusive for them. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that their needs are being met.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultures and beliefs within the Orthodox Jewish community, and highlight this diversity during cultural celebrations. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity for all participants.
8. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services during cultural celebrations to ensure that non-English speakers can fully participate.
9. Create adaptive traditions: Be willing to adapt cultural traditions
