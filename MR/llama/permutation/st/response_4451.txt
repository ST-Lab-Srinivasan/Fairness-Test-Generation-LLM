Mentorship has played a significant role in the development and well-being of mixed Asian heritage individuals aged over 90 years old. Here are some ways mentorship has influenced their lives:

1. Cultural identity formation: Growing up as a mixed-race individual can be challenging, especially when it comes to navigating different cultural identities and belonging. Mentorship from elders or experienced individuals in the community can provide guidance on how to embrace and navigate these complex identities, fostering a sense of belonging and self-esteem.
2. Navigating intergenerational trauma: The experiences of mixed Asian heritage individuals are shaped by historical events such as colonization, war, and migration. Mentorship can provide a safe space to process and discuss these experiences, helping individuals understand their family history and cultural background in a more nuanced way.
3. Preserving cultural traditions: Elders in the community can share traditional practices, language, and customs with younger generations, ensuring that cultural heritage is passed down accurately and respectfully. This mentorship can help maintain cultural continuity and preserve cultural identity.
4. Building resilience: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may face discrimination, racism, or microaggressions throughout their lives. Mentorship from supportive individuals can help build resilience and coping strategies, enabling them to navigate challenging situations more effectively.
5. Developing social connections: Mentorship can provide opportunities for mixed Asian heritage individuals to connect with others who share similar experiences, fostering a sense of community and belonging. This social connection is crucial for mental and emotional well-being, especially during later life stages when social isolation can become more prevalent.
6. Preserving cultural knowledge: Elders in the community can impart valuable knowledge and skills related to traditional practices, crafts, and other cultural activities. This mentorship can help preserve cultural heritage and ensure that it is passed down to future generations.
7. Fostering language preservation: Many mixed Asian heritage individuals may speak multiple languages, but language barriers can still exist, especially in later life stages. Mentorship from fluent speakers can help maintain and improve language skills, ensuring that cultural traditions are preserved
