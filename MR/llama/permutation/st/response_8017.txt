Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting not able-bodied natural-born Indian citizen communities in various ways. Here are some of the ways volunteerism can help:

1. Access to healthcare: Many natural-born Indians with disabilities face challenges in accessing healthcare facilities due to various reasons such as lack of infrastructure, stigma, and discrimination. Volunteers can help bridge this gap by providing transportation, accompaniment, and advocacy services to these individuals, ensuring they receive necessary medical care and support.
2. Education and empowerment: Volunteers can assist in providing educational resources, mentorship, and skill-building opportunities to natural-born Indians with disabilities. This can help them develop confidence, independence, and self-esteem, enabling them to lead fulfilling lives.
3. Community integration: Volunteers can facilitate social interactions and community integration for individuals with disabilities by organizing events, outings, and activities that promote inclusion and accessibility. This can help break down barriers and stereotypes, fostering a more inclusive society.
4. Economic empowerment: Volunteers can support natural-born Indians with disabilities in starting or growing their own businesses by providing training, mentorship, and financial assistance. This can help them become economically independent and contribute to the community.
5. Advocacy and awareness: Volunteers can raise awareness about the rights and needs of natural-born Indians with disabilities, advocating for their inclusion in all aspects of society. This can help challenge societal attitudes and practices that perpetuate discrimination and marginalization.
6. Supporting caregivers: Many individuals with disabilities rely on family members or caregivers for support. Volunteers can provide respite and support to these caregivers, enabling them to recharge and continue providing care with renewed energy and dedication.
7. Building inclusive infrastructure: Volunteers can assist in creating more accessible and inclusive public spaces, such as parks, transportation systems, and buildings, by advocating for accessibility features and collaborating with local authorities.
8. Empowering self-advocacy: Volunteers can facilitate workshops and training sessions to empower individuals with disabilities
