Creating more inclusive social policies for lower-income married individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this population. Here are some recommendations to create more inclusive policies:

1. Increase the minimum marriageable age: Lower-income couples often face financial constraints and lack of support during their early years of marriage.
