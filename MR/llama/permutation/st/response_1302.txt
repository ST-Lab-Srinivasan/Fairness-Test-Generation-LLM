5. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may be preventing non-newly married non-middle-class individuals from reaching their professional aspirations, such as discrimination, bias, or lack of access to opportunities.
6. Encourage flexible work arrangements: Allow individuals to balance their work and personal responsibilities by providing flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting, part-time work, or job sharing.
7. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance, such as grants, loans, or scholarships, to help individuals pursue their professional aspirations.
8. Create opportunities for entrepreneurship and innovation: Encourage and support individuals in starting their own businesses or pursuing innovative ideas, which can lead to new opportunities and career growth.
