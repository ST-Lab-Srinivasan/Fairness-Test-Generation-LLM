6. Community Support: Build a network of supportive communities that provide emotional and practical support during this challenging time. This can include peer-to-peer support groups, online forums, or local organizations that offer counseling and other services.
7. Legal Assistance: Provide legal assistance to help individuals navigate the legal process of divorce or separation, including issues related to property division, spousal support, and child custody.
8. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that recently single Hispanic individuals have access to affordable healthcare options, including mental health services, which can be particularly important during this time of transition.
9. Housing Support: Offer resources and support for finding affordable housing or securing a mortgage, especially for those who may be facing challenges in their housing situation due to the divorce or separation.
