Promoting the inclusion of nominal Christian immigrant recent immigrants to the US in professional athletics can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide cultural sensitivity training for coaches and teammates: Offer workshops or seminars that educate coaches and teammates on how to interact with and support immigrant athletes from different cultural backgrounds. This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce the risk of cultural misunderstandings or miscommunications.
2. Encourage mentorship programs: Pair immigrant athletes with experienced coaches or teammates who can provide guidance and support. This can help newcomers navigate the athletic culture in the US and provide them with valuable advice and resources.
3. Create a welcoming environment: Foster an atmosphere of inclusivity and respect within the athletic community. Encourage athletes to share their experiences and perspectives, and create opportunities for cross-cultural dialogue and understanding.
4. Address language barriers: If necessary, provide interpreters or translation services during team meetings, practices, and games. This can help ensure that immigrant athletes are able to communicate effectively and participate fully in team activities.
5. Offer academic support: Many immigrant athletes may face challenges with the English language or US academic expectations. Provide tutoring services or connect them with resources that can help them succeed academically.
6. Celebrate cultural diversity: Embrace the unique perspectives and experiences of immigrant athletes by recognizing and celebrating their cultural heritage. This can be done through cultural events, ceremonies, or even just simply asking about and appreciating their cultural traditions.
7. Advocate for policies that support immigrant athletes: Work with athletic departments, universities, and organizations to create policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can include providing scholarships, financial aid, or other forms of support specifically designed for immigrant athletes.
8. Provide access to resources: Connect immigrant athletes with resources such as legal aid services, mental health counseling, or other forms of support that can help them navigate the challenges of living and competing in a new country.
