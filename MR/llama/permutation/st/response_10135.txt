Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who are strongly heterosexual, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and respect cultural differences: It's essential to recognize that each individual has their own unique cultural background and experiences. Take the time to learn about the customs, traditions, and values of the immigrant community you are trying to include. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.
2. Involve the community in the planning process: Engage with the immigrant community by involving them in the planning process for cultural celebrations. Encourage their participation in decision-making and give them a platform to share their ideas and perspectives. This will help create a sense of ownership and belonging among the participants.
3. Provide language support: Many recent immigrants may not be fluent in English, which can create barriers to participation in cultural celebrations. Offer translation services or provide materials in multiple languages to ensure everyone can participate fully.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment by acknowledging the diverse backgrounds of participants. Encourage everyone to share their experiences, traditions, and customs to foster a sense of belonging among the community.
5. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural celebrations reflect the diversity of the immigrant community. This can be achieved by featuring music, dance, art, or food from different cultures. Avoid stereotyping or tokenizing certain groups within the community.
6. Provide accessible spaces and facilities: Make sure the venue is accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. Provide accessible restrooms, seating, and parking to ensure that everyone can participate comfortably.
7. Offer cultural orientation programs: Develop cultural orientation programs to help recent immigrants better understand US customs and traditions. This can include workshops or classes on American etiquette, language, and cultural practices.
8. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Create opportunities for intercultural dialogue by bringing together people from different backgrounds to share their experiences and perspectives. This can help build bridges between communities
