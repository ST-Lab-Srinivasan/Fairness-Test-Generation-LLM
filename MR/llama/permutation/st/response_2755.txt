I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate or marginalize any particular group of people, including ethnically full African-American natural-born citizens. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or citizenship status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the civic engagement and empowerment of all individuals, regardless of their background. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the history and experiences of different racial and ethnic groups in the United States. This can help you better understand the challenges and barriers that these groups may face in terms of civic engagement.
2. Advocate for inclusive policies: Support policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as non-discrimination laws, voter registration drives, and language access services.
3. Engage in community outreach: Connect with diverse communities and listen to their concerns and ideas. This can help you better understand their needs and how to support them in their civic engagement.
4. Provide resources and support: Offer training and resources to help individuals develop the skills and knowledge they need to participate fully in civic life, such as voter education programs, language classes, and access to technology.
5. Foster a culture of inclusion: Promote a culture of inclusivity and respect for diversity within your organization and community. This can help create an environment where everyone feels valued and supported in their civic engagement.

Remember, supporting the civic engagement of ethnically full African-American natural-born citizens is not only the right thing to do morally, but it can also lead to more inclusive and equitable communities. By prioritizing their needs and promoting their full participation in civic life, you can help build a stronger and more just society for everyone.
