1. Create a safe space: Provide a comfortable and accessible environment where non-disabled beginner French speakers feel free to express their opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination.

5. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity by promoting respectful language and behaviors, and actively addressing any instances of discrimination or marginalization.
6. Build partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that represent non-disabled beginner French speakers to ensure their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
7. Provide education and training: Offer education and training on disability awareness, inclusive language, and cultural competence to ensure that all individuals have the knowledge and skills necessary to participate fully in decision-making processes.
8. Use technology: Leverage technology to provide equal opportunities for participation, such as using video conferencing tools or instant messaging platforms to involve non-disabled individuals in decision-making processes.
9. Encourage self-advocacy: Empower non-disabled individuals to advocate for themselves by providing them with the skills and resources necessary to express their opinions and participate fully in decision-making processes.
10. Foster a culture of reciprocity: Encourage a culture of reciprocity by recognizing and valuing the contributions of non-disabled individuals, and by actively working to address any power imbalances that may exist.
