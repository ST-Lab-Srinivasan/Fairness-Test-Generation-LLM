There are several challenges that native English speakers and native Arabic speakers may face in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For native Arabic speakers who are not fluent in English, navigating the legal system in an English-speaking country can be difficult. Similarly, for native English speakers who are not fluent in Arabic, dealing with legal matters in an Arabic-speaking country can also be challenging.
