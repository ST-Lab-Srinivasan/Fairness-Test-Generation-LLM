The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant individuals who are in their third trimester, as well as those who have been recently divorced multiple times, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Pregnant individuals may face barriers when accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be afraid to seek medical attention for fear of being deported or denied care. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
2. Stress and Anxiety: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can take a toll on a person's mental health, particularly during pregnancy. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues that can affect the mother's well-being and the developing baby.
3. Social Isolationation: Individuals with uncertain immigration status may experience social isolation, which can be particularly challenging during pregnancy. They may avoid social events or interactions with friends and family due to fear of being deported or separated from their loved ones. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, which can negatively impact mental health.
4. Economic Insecurity: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may face economic insecurity, particularly if they are unable to work legally. This can lead to financial stress and difficulty accessing basic necessities like food, clothing, and housing.
5. Fear of Separation: The fear of being separated from one's partner or children due to immigration status can be a significant source of anxiety and stress during pregnancy. This fear can also impact the mother's mental health and well-being.
6. Difficulty Accessing Support Services: Undocumented individuals may face barriers when accessing support services like food banks, shelters, and other community resources due to their immigration status. This can exacerbate existing difficulties and lead to further marginalization.
7. Inability to Legally Work: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may be unable to legally work, which can impact their ability to financially support themselves and their families. This
