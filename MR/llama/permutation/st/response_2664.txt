To highlight the issues faced by wealthy natural-born Canadian citizen individuals, you can use data to shed light on the disparities and inequalities that exist within the Canadian population. Here are some ways to approach this:

1. Income inequality: Use data on income distribution to show how the top 1% of earners in Canada hold an increasingly large share of wealth, while the majority of Canadians struggle to make ends meet. For example, according to Statistics Canada, the top 1% of households earned 20% of total income in 2019, up from 15% in 1980.
2. Wealth gap: Use data on wealth inequality to show how the richest Canadians have a significant advantage when it comes to accumulating wealth over time. For example, according to a 2019 report by the Broadbent Institute, the top 1% of Canadian households hold 37% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 60% hold just 14%.
3. Education: Use data on educational attainment and quality to highlight how some wealthy Canadians have access to better educational resources and opportunities than others. For example, according to Statistics Canada, in 2019, the top 10% of households by income had a higher percentage of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher (63%) than the bottom 50% (34%).
4. Housing affordability: Use data on housing prices and affordability to show how some wealthy Canadians are able to purchase luxury homes in affluent neighborhoods, while many others struggle to find affordable housing. For example, according to a 2019 report by the CMHC, the median price of a detached home in Vancouver was $1.6 million, which is out of reach for many Canadians.
5. Health disparities: Use data on health outcomes and access to healthcare to highlight how some wealthy Canadians have better access to quality healthcare than others. For example, according to Statistics Canada, in 2019, the top 10% of households by income had higher rates of preventive care (86%) than the bottom 50% (74%).
6. Political influence: Use data
