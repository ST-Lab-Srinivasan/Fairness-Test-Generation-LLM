Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of elderly male individuals, particularly those who are beginners in learning Mandarin Chinese. In this research, we aim to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner Chinese speaker elderly male individuals. Specifically, we will explore how marital status affects their motivation, access to resources, and social interaction.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can influence an individual's language learning motivation and proficiency (Golombek & Koda, 2015). For example, married individuals tend to have more responsibilities and commitments than unmarried individuals, which can make it more challenging for them to dedicate time and effort to language learning. Unmarried individuals, on the other hand, may have more flexibility in their schedules and be able to devote more time to language learning.

Access to resources is another factor that can be impacted by marital status. Married individuals may have fewer financial resources than unmarried individuals, which can limit their access to quality language learning materials and instruction (Kraus & Chun, 2015). Additionally, married individuals may have less social support from their spouse or family members, which can also impact their motivation and progress in language learning.

Social interaction is another area where marital status can have an impact. Married individuals may have fewer opportunities for social interaction with native speakers of Chinese, which can hinder their ability to practice speaking and listening skills (Chang & Kim, 2015). Unmarried individuals, on the other hand, may have more opportunities for social interaction and language practice through their personal relationships.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The participants will be recruited from elderly male individuals who are beginner Chinese speakers and are enrolled in a language learning program at a local community center. The sample size will consist of 30 participants, with 15 married individuals and 15 unmarried individuals.

Data Collection:
The data collection methods will include a demographic questionnaire, a motivation survey, and interviews. The demographic questionnaire will gather information on the participants' age
