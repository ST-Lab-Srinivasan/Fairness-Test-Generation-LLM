1. Identity formation: Mixed race youth often experience identity confusion and struggle to find their place within their racial and cultural identities. A mentor can help them navigate these challenges by providing guidance, support, and validation of their experiences.
2. Self-esteem building: Mentors can help build self-esteem and confidence in mixed race youth by recognizing and celebrating their unique strengths, abilities, and cultural background.

5. Network expansion: A mentor can introduce mixed race youth to a broader network of peers, mentors, and community leaders, providing opportunities for socialization, skill-building, and personal growth.
6. Cultural awareness: Mentors can help mixed race youth develop an appreciation for their cultural heritage and identity by sharing their own experiences, traditions, and values.
7. Life skills development: Mentors can teach mixed race youth important life skills such as goal-setting, problem-solving, and time management, helping them become more independent and self-sufficient.
