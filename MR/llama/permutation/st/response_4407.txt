Addressing the specific needs of immigrant natural-born US citizens who are not long-time married individuals in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies that can help address their needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Immigrant students may face language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination. Teachers can benefit from training in culturally responsive teaching practices to create an inclusive learning environment. This includes understanding the immigrant students' experiences, values, and beliefs.
2. Bilingual education: Providing bilingual education programs or English language learner (ELL) services can help immigrant students succeed academically. These programs can also provide a sense of belonging and identity for students who are navigating two cultures.
3. Support for undocumented students: Undocumented immigrants face unique challenges, including fear of deportation and limited access to financial aid. Educators can provide support by creating safe spaces for undocumented students, advocating for policies that protect their rights, and connecting them with resources such as immigration legal services.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Immigrant students may feel isolated or excluded from mainstream society due to cultural or language barriers. Educators can foster a sense of belonging by promoting diversity and inclusivity in the classroom, providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and cultures, and encouraging cross-cultural understanding.
5. Address systemic barriers: Education systems must address systemic barriers that hinder immigrant students' success, such as inadequate funding, lack of resources, and discriminatory policies. Advocating for policies that support immigrant students and their families can help address these issues.
6. Family engagement: Engaging with immigrant students' families is crucial for their academic success. Educators can work with parents to provide language support, cultural sensitivity training, and opportunities for family involvement in the educational process.
7. Community partnerships: Building partnerships with community organizations that serve immigrant populations can provide additional resources and support for students and families. These partnerships can also help bridge the gap between the school and the broader immigrant community.
