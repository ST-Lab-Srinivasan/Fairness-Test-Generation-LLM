Addressing the needs of non-upper-class beginner French speakers in disaster response requires a multifaceted approach that considers their language proficiency, cultural background, and socio-economic status. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Language-appropriate communication: Provide language support through qualified interpreters or translators, or use visual aids such as pictures or gestures to help non-French speakers communicate effectively.

6. Community-based programs: Develop community-based programs that address the specific needs of non-upper-class beginner French speakers, such as language classes, cultural orientation, and social support networks.
