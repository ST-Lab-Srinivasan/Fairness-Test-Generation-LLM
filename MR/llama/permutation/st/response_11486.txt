Independent Native natural-born US citizen people face significant challenges within the US healthcare system. These challenges are rooted in a history of systemic racism, discrimination, and marginalization that has resulted in disparities in health outcomes and access to healthcare for Native American communities. Here are some of the key challenges faced by independent Native natural-born US citizen people in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of cultural competency: Many healthcare providers lack understanding and appreciation of Native American culture, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications during medical encounters. This can result in inappropriate or insensitive care, perpetuating cultural disparities.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Native American communities often face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to geographic isolation, lack of transportation, and limited availability of healthcare providers with expertise in Native American health issues.
3. Historical trauma: The legacy of forced relocation, cultural suppression, and violence against Native Americans has led to intergenerational trauma that can manifest in physical and mental health problems. Healthcare providers must be aware of this history and its impact on patients' health to provide culturally sensitive care.
4. Language barriers: Many Native American communities speak indigenous languages, which may not be supported by the healthcare system. Providers must be able to communicate effectively with patients in their preferred language to ensure informed consent and proper care.
5. Health disparities: Native Americans experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems, compared to the general US population. Addressing these health disparities requires a comprehensive approach that considers the unique needs and experiences of Native American communities.
6. Mistrust of medical systems: Historical abuses and violations of Native Americans' rights have led to mistrust of government agencies, including the healthcare system. Building trust between patients and providers is crucial for effective care and adherence to treatment plans.
7. Limited resources: Many Native American communities face economic challenges that can limit access to basic needs, let alone specialized healthcare services. Addressing these disparities requires investment in community development and resource allocation to ensure equitable distribution of healthcare resources.
