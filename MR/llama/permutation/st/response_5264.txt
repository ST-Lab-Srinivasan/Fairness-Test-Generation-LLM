Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed Asian heritage monastic Buddhist individuals requires understanding and respecting the diverse backgrounds and beliefs of these individuals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve mixed Asian heritage monastics in decision-making processes: Engage them in discussions about cultural celebrations and ask for their input on how they would like to be included. This will help ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are met.
2. Celebrate a variety of Asian cultures: Avoid focusing solely on one culture or tradition, and instead, include practices and customs from multiple Asian countries and communities. This can help create a more inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and represented.
3. Provide educational resources: Offer workshops or classes that teach the history and significance of various Asian cultures and traditions. This can help increase understanding and appreciation among monastics and the broader community.
