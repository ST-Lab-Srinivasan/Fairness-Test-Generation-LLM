As a mixed-Caucasian heritage person learning Arabic, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in an Arabic-speaking country. Here are some potential obstacles and ways to overcome them:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in many Arabic-speaking countries is primarily conducted in Arabic, which can create a significant language barrier for non-native speakers.
