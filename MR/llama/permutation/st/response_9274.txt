Native French speakers in Nigeria may face several challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barrier: As you mentioned, French is one of the official languages of Nigeria, but it's not widely spoken, especially in rural areas. This can create a language barrier for native French speakers who may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers who are not fluent in French.
2. Cultural differences: As a country with a diverse population, Nigeria has many cultural groups with their own beliefs and practices. Native French speakers may face challenges navigating the healthcare system due to cultural differences between their own cultural background and the dominant culture of the healthcare providers.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Many parts of Nigeria have limited access to healthcare, especially in rural areas. Native French speakers may face challenges accessing healthcare services, including lack of transportation, long distances to healthcare facilities, and financial barriers.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on language, culture, or ethnicity is prevalent in Nigeria. Native French speakers may face discrimination when seeking healthcare, which can lead to delays or poor quality care.
5. Limited health literacy: Many people in Nigeria have limited health literacy, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system, including native French speakers. They may have difficulty understanding medical terminology, procedures, and treatments, which can lead to miscommunication or misunderstandings with healthcare providers.
6. Stigma: Mental illnesses are often stigmatized in Nigeria, and native French speakers may face discrimination or stigma when seeking healthcare for mental health issues. This can make it difficult for them to access the care they need.
7. Gender bias: Gender bias is prevalent in Nigeria, and native French speakers may face discrimination or unequal treatment based on their gender. For example, women may face barriers when seeking reproductive healthcare services.
8. Limited specialized care: Nigeria faces a shortage of specialized healthcare providers, including those who speak French. Native French speakers may have difficulty accessing specialized care, such as cardiology or oncology services.
