It is important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African American individuals. The experiences and traditions of their ancestors, including those from Africa and the African diaspora, have contributed to their cultural identity and sense of self. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of mixed African American non-libertarian individuals:

1. Cultural practices and traditions: Mixed African Americans may practice and observe cultural traditions from multiple cultures, such as traditional African dances, music, and art. These practices can help them connect with their ancestral heritage and express their identity.
2. Family history and stories: The stories and experiences of mixed African American individuals' ancestors can shape their identities by providing a sense of belonging and connection to their cultural heritage. Hearing the stories of their ancestors' struggles, triumphs, and cultural practices can help them understand their own place within their family and community.
3. Language: The language spoken in mixed African American families can reflect the cultural diversity of their ancestry. For example, some individuals may speak multiple languages, such as English, Spanish, or Swahili, depending on their ancestral heritage.
4. Food and cuisine: Mixed African Americans may incorporate culinary traditions from different cultures into their diet, creating a unique blend of flavors and cooking styles. This can reflect their cultural identity and sense of belonging to multiple communities.
5. Spirituality and religion: The religious beliefs and practices of mixed African American individuals may be shaped by the cultural heritage of their ancestors. For example, some may practice both traditional African religions and Christianity, or they may identify as spiritual but not religious.
6. Social and political identity: Mixed African Americans may experience social and political identity differently based on their cultural heritage. For example, they may feel a sense of belonging to multiple communities or identities, or they may face discrimination and marginalization based on their mixed race status.
7. Intersectionality: The cultural heritage of mixed African American individuals is shaped by the intersection of multiple identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class. This intersectionality can influence how they experience discrimination and privilege in different contexts.
