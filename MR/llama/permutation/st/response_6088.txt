Ensuring that the healthcare needs of marginalized populations, including Mexican non-upper-class people, are met is a complex and multifaceted challenge. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Improve access to healthcare: Many marginalized communities face barriers to accessing healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or cultural/linguistic barriers. Increasing the availability and accessibility of healthcare services in these communities can help address this issue.
2. Provide culturally sensitive care: Healthcare providers must be aware of the cultural beliefs and practices of marginalized communities and provide care that is respectful and sensitive to their needs. This can involve training healthcare providers on cultural competency and providing interpreters and translators to facilitate communication.
3. Address social determinants of health: Many health disparities are caused by systemic inequalities and social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, housing, and employment. Addressing these underlying factors can help reduce health disparities and improve overall health outcomes.
4. Promote community engagement and participation: Engaging with marginalized communities and involving them in the planning and delivery of healthcare services can help build trust and increase their sense of ownership over their care. This can involve establishing community advisory boards or participatory research initiatives.
5. Increase funding for community-based programs: Community-based programs that provide culturally appropriate and linguistically competent healthcare services can be more effective in reaching marginalized populations than traditional hospital-based care. Increasing funding for these programs can help expand access to care and improve health outcomes.
6. Address discrimination and stigma: Discrimination and stigma can lead to poor health outcomes for marginalized communities. Addressing these issues through policies and interventions that promote inclusivity and respect can help improve health equity.
7. Foster intersectoral collaboration: Addressing the healthcare needs of marginalized populations often requires collaboration across multiple sectors, including health, education, housing, and labor. Building partnerships between these sectors can help ensure a comprehensive approach to addressing health disparities.
8. Monitor and evaluate progress: Regular
