The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who are not widowed for a long time can be significant and far-reaching. Some common impacts include:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face challenges in socializing and forming relationships, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Depending on the nature and severity of their disability, individuals may face barriers in accessing educational opportunities or finding employment.
3. Financial difficulties: Disabilities can result in increased costs for healthcare, assistive technology, and other accommodations, which can put a strain on an individual's finances.
4. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities may experience stigma and discrimination from family members, friends, and strangers, which can further marginalize them.
5. Lack of representation and voice: Individuals with disabilities may feel underrepresented or unheard in society, leading to a lack of understanding and support for their needs.
6. Limited access to healthcare: People with disabilities may encounter difficulties in accessing healthcare services due to lack of accessibility, lack of knowledge about their condition, or lack of empathy from healthcare providers.
7. Emotional toll: Living with a disability can take an emotional toll on individuals and their families, leading to anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges.
8. Lack of independence: Depending on the nature of their disability, individuals may require constant support or assistance, limiting their independence and autonomy.
9. Limited access to leisure activities: People with disabilities may face barriers in participating in leisure activities due to lack of accessibility or societal stigma.
10. Impact on family dynamics: Living with a disability can impact not only the individual but also their family members, leading to changes in roles and responsibilities within the family.

It's important to recognize that these impacts can vary depending on the individual's experience, cultural background, and socio-economic status. It's essential to create an inclusive society that supports people with disabilities in realizing their full potential and living fulfilling lives.
