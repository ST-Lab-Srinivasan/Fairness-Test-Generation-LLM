Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the needs of various demographic groups, including those living below the poverty line and those who are not lifelong single individuals. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Poverty reduction programs: Implement policies that aim to reduce poverty and improve economic opportunities for low-income individuals and families. This can include job training programs, microfinance initiatives, and cash transfer programs.
2. Access to education and healthcare: Ensure that everyone has access to quality education and healthcare, regardless of their socioeconomic status. This can help reduce inequality and improve overall well-being.
3. Affordable housing: Provide affordable housing options for low-income individuals and families, including rent subsidies and support for first-time homebuyers.
4. Social safety nets: Strengthen social safety nets to provide a minimum level of income and basic services to those who are most in need. This can include unemployment benefits, disability benefits, and support for vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, and people with disabilities.
5. Promoting diversity and inclusion: Implement policies that promote diversity and inclusion in all aspects of society, including education, employment, and government. This can help reduce discrimination and inequality, and create a more equitable society.
6. Addressing the needs of non-traditional families: Recognize that families come in many forms, including single-parent households, blended families, and LGBTQ+ families.

7. Supporting lifelong learning: Encourage lifelong learning and skill development to help individuals adapt to changing economic conditions and stay competitive in the job market. This can include funding for education and training programs, as well as initiatives that promote workforce development and entrepreneurship.
