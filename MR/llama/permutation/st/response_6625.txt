Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of advanced ultra-conservative beliefs and behaviors, particularly among individuals over the age of 90. Here are some possible reasons why:

1. Socialization and Cultural Reinforcement: Ultra-conservative individuals often grow up in communities where traditional values and beliefs are deeply ingrained and reinforced through social interactions with family, friends, and community members.

This fear can be particularly pronounced among older adults who have spent a significant portion of their lives identifying as
