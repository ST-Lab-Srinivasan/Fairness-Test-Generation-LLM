Promoting the social inclusion of ethnically full African-American communities that are not deep in poverty requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the interconnected issues of race, class, and power. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Address systemic racism: The first step is to acknowledge and address the systemic racism that perpetuates racial disparities in wealth, education, and access to opportunities. This involves policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels to dismantle structural barriers and create more equitable distribution of resources.
2. Improve access to quality education: Quality education is a critical factor in promoting social inclusion. Investing in public schools, providing additional resources for under-resourced schools, and implementing programs that support student success can help level the playing field for African-American students.
3. Develop community-based initiatives: Community-based initiatives such as mentorship programs, after-school activities, and job training can provide valuable opportunities for young people in these communities to develop skills, build relationships, and access resources that can help them succeed.
4. Foster cross-racial understanding and empathy: Building bridges between different racial groups is essential for promoting social inclusion. This involves creating spaces for dialogue, empathy, and mutual understanding among people of different races and backgrounds.
5. Support local businesses and economic development: Investing in local businesses and supporting economic development can help create jobs and generate wealth within these communities. This can help reduce poverty and promote economic mobility for African-American families.

This involves investing in community health centers, providing mental health services, and addressing systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from accessing quality healthcare.
