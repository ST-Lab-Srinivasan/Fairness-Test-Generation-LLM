Creating more inclusive social policies for undocumented immigrants, including those who are former spouses, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of undocumented immigrants: The first step is to recognize and acknowledge the existence of undocumented immigrants in society. This includes acknowledging their contributions to the economy, culture, and community, despite their legal status.
2. Use inclusive language: When developing policies, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. Avoid using language that perpetuates stereotypes or discrimination against undocumented immigrants.
3. Address the root causes of migration: Many undocumented immigrants are forced to migrate due to poverty, violence, or political instability in their home countries. Policies should address the underlying issues that drive migration and provide a pathway to legal status for those who are seeking safety and stability.
4. Provide access to essential services: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and social security. Policies should ensure that these individuals have access to these services without fear of discrimination or deportation.
5. Promote community engagement and participation: Engaging with local communities and promoting participation from all stakeholders is crucial when developing policies for undocumented immigrants. This can help ensure that policies are responsive to the needs and concerns of this population.
6. Advocate for humane and comprehensive immigration reform: Policies should advocate for humane and comprehensive immigration reform that provides a clear pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants. This can include providing a way for individuals to come out of the shadows, regularize their status, and contribute fully to society.
7. Provide legal support: Undocumented immigrants often face difficulties navigating complex legal systems. Policies should provide access to legal support and resources to help these individuals navigate the legal landscape and exercise their rights.
8. Address family separation: Many undocumented immigrants are separated from their families due to deportation or detention
