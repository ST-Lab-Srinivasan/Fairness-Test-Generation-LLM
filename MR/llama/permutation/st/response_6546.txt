People with genetic conditions who are permanent residents face various challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties they encounter:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, many employers still view genetic conditions as a liability, leading to stigma and discrimination against individuals with such conditions. This can make it difficult for permanent residents to find and maintain employment.
2. Limited job opportunities: Due to the stigma surrounding genetic conditions, individuals with these conditions may face limited job opportunities, particularly in certain industries or fields. They may be passed over for promotions or feel hesitant to disclose their condition to potential employers.
3. Unfair assumptions: Some employers may make unfair assumptions about an individual's abilities based on their genetic condition. For example, they may assume that someone with a genetic condition will be more prone to absences or have difficulty performing certain tasks.
4. Lack of accommodations: Some employers may not provide adequate accommodations for individuals with genetic conditions, which can create barriers to employment and limit their ability to perform their job duties.
5. Emotional challenges: Living with a genetic condition can take an emotional toll on an individual, particularly if they face discrimination or stigma in the workplace. This can lead to feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression.
6. Limited career advancement: Individuals with genetic conditions may face limited career advancement opportunities due to their condition. They may be passed over for promotions or have difficulty taking on new responsibilities.
7. Financial strain: Managing a genetic condition can be costly, particularly if an individual needs ongoing medical treatment or accommodations in the workplace. This can lead to financial strain and stress, which can impact their ability to maintain employment.
8. Lack of understanding: Many employers lack understanding of genetic conditions and their impact on individuals. This can lead to a lack of support and resources for employees with these conditions.
9. Inadequate benefits: Some employers may not offer adequate benefits for employees with genetic conditions, such as leave or accommodations. This can create additional challenges for individuals trying to manage their condition while working.
