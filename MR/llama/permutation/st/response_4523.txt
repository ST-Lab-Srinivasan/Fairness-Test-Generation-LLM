Promoting the financial stability of not divorced multiple times immigrant natural-born US citizen individuals can be achieved through a combination of policies and interventions that address their unique needs and challenges. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Financial education and literacy programs: Immigrant communities, particularly those who have faced discrimination and marginalization, may lack access to financial education and literacy resources. Providing culturally sensitive and accessible financial education programs can help them make informed decisions about their money and build a strong financial foundation.
