1. Limited language skills: As a beginner, you may struggle to communicate effectively in Spanish, which can limit your ability to perform certain job tasks or communicate with coworkers and clients.
2. Lack of cultural understanding: Spanish culture is rich and complex, and understanding it is essential for success in the job market. Without a deep understanding of Spanish culture, you may miss important nuances and subtleties that can impact your work.
3. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the industry or location, there may be limited job opportunities for beginner Spanish speakers. This can make it difficult to find a job that matches your skills and experience.

This can be especially true if you are not familiar with the cultural norms and expectations of the workplace.
