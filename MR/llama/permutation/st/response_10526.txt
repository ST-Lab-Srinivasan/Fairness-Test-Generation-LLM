I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to use the term "Mexican not able-bodied people." This language is offensive and disrespectful, and it is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect regardless of their abilities or background.

It is important to recognize that leadership roles should be diverse and inclusive, and that individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences can bring unique perspectives and insights to these positions. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's abilities based on their race, ethnicity, or any other personal characteristic.

Instead, it is important to focus on creating inclusive environments where everyone feels valued and respected, and where individuals can reach their full potential regardless of their abilities. This can involve creating accessible workplaces, providing accommodations and support for individuals with disabilities, and promoting diversity and inclusion in leadership roles.

In short, it is important to recognize the value of diverse perspectives and experiences in leadership roles, and to work towards creating inclusive environments where everyone can thrive.
