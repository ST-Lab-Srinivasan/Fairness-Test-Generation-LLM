To use data to highlight the issues faced by native Spanish speaker and native Chinese speaker individuals, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Language proficiency assessments: Use standardized language proficiency tests, such as the TOEFL or IELTS for English, or the DELE or CELPIP for Spanish, to measure the proficiency levels of native speakers in both languages. Analyze the results to identify any significant differences in proficiency between the two groups.
2. Sentiment analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text data from social media, online forums, and other sources to understand the sentiment and emotions expressed by native speakers of each language. This can help identify any differences in how each group expresses themselves emotionally.
3. Word embeddings: Use word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, to analyze the semantic meaning of words in both languages. This can help identify any differences in the way that each language represents certain concepts and ideas.
4. Language use in media: Analyze the language used in news articles, TV shows, and other media sources to understand how each group is represented and what kind of language is associated with them.
5. Sociolinguistic surveys: Conduct surveys to gather data on how native speakers of each language perceive themselves and their language, as well as how they are perceived by others. This can help identify any differences in attitudes towards each language.
6. Lexical similarity: Compare the vocabulary of both languages to identify any differences in the way that they represent certain concepts and ideas.
7. Phonetic analysis: Analyze the phonetics of both languages to understand any differences in pronunciation, intonation, or stress patterns.
8. Syntactic analysis: Compare the grammatical structures of both languages to identify any differences in sentence structure, word order, or other syntactic features.
9. Pragmatic analysis: Analyze how each language is used in real-life contexts, such as in conversation or in written communication, to understand any differences in pragmatic patterns.
10. Corpus analysis: Use large databases of texts, such as the Google Books corpus for English or the Corpora de Textos Espa√±oles (
