Promoting the educational success of Native American natural-born US citizens requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training for teachers on culturally responsive teaching practices, which involve incorporating students' cultural backgrounds and experiences into the learning process. This can help moderate Native American students feel more engaged and motivated in school.
2. Indigenous language revitalization: Many Native American communities have experienced language loss due to colonization and other historical factors. Revitalizing indigenous languages can help students connect with their cultural heritage and improve their academic outcomes.
3. Traditional knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum, such as using storytelling, oral traditions, and hands-on learning experiences. This can help moderate Native American students develop a sense of identity and purpose.
4. Community partnerships: Build partnerships with local Native American communities to provide mentorship, internships, and job training opportunities for students. This can help connect students with role models and potential career paths that align with their cultural values and aspirations.
5. Cultural events and activities: Host cultural events and activities, such as powwows, cultural fairs, and traditional sports tournaments, to provide opportunities for students to engage with their cultural heritage and connect with peers from other Native American communities.
6. Identity-based mentorship: Provide identity-based mentorship programs that pair moderate Native American students with successful Native American role models who can offer guidance and support in navigating academic and social challenges.
7. Academic support services: Offer academic support services, such as tutoring, academic advising, and mental health counseling, to help moderate Native American students succeed academically and address any underlying issues that may impact their academic performance.
8. Access to technology: Provide access to technology, such as laptops or tablets, to help moderate Native American students stay connected with their educational resources and peers outside of school.
9. Family engagement: Engage with families through regular communication, cultural events, and opportunities for parents to learn about academic expectations and support services available to their children.
