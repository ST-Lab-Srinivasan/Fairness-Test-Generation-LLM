Addressing the needs of low-income Mandarin individuals in disaster response requires a tailored approach that takes into account their unique circumstances and challenges. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to address their needs:

1. Language accessibility: Provide interpreters and translators who are fluent in Mandarin to assist in communication during disaster response efforts. This can help ensure that critical information is shared with this population in a language they can understand.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Train disaster responders on cultural sensitivities and how to interact with low-income Mandarin individuals who may have different customs, beliefs, and values than other populations. This can help build trust and rapport during disaster response efforts.

8. Inclusive planning: Ensure that disaster response plans are inclusive of the needs of low-income Mandarin individuals and take into account their unique circumstances and challenges. This can involve conducting community outreach and engagement activities to identify specific needs and develop
