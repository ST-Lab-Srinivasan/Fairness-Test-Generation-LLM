Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty Native American natural-born US citizen students is crucial for their academic success and cultural preservation. Here are some strategies that can help meet these needs:

1. Culturally responsive curriculum: Develop culturally responsive curricula that incorporate Native American history, culture, and perspectives. This can include traditional ecological knowledge, storytelling, and art.
2. Tribal partnerships: Collaborate with local tribes to design and deliver educational programs that are tailored to the needs of their students. This can involve working with tribal elders, educators, and community members to develop culturally relevant curricula and pedagogies.
3. Language revitalization: Support language revitalization efforts by incorporating Native American languages into the curriculum and providing language immersion programs. This can help preserve cultural heritage and promote linguistic diversity.
4. Indigenous teacher training: Provide training and support for Indigenous teachers to develop their skills and knowledge in teaching and learning practices that are responsive to the needs of Native American students.
5. Cultural events and activities: Organize cultural events and activities that celebrate and promote Native American culture, such as powwows, drumming circles, and traditional craft-making workshops. These can help create a sense of community and belonging for Native American students.
6. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Native American students with successful Indigenous role models, providing them with guidance, support, and inspiration to succeed academically and professionally.
7. Community service projects: Develop community service projects that allow students to engage in activities that benefit their communities, such as cleaning up local parks or participating in environmental conservation projects. This can help foster a sense of responsibility and civic engagement among Native American students.
8. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives into the curriculum, recognizing the valuable contributions that Native Americans have made to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.
9. Support for veterans: Provide support services specifically designed for active-duty Native American military personnel, including academic counseling, career guidance, and mental health resources
