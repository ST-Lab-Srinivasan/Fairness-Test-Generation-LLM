As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that atheism is a personal belief and should not be subject to discrimination or persecution in any society. In Nigeria, as in many other countries, there are challenges faced by non-believers, particularly those who identify as strong atheists. Here are some of the legal challenges they may face:

1. Blasphemy laws: Many African countries, including Nigeria, have blasphemy laws that criminalize insults or defamation of religious beliefs. Strong atheists in Nigeria may find themselves on the wrong side of these laws, which can lead to arrest, prosecution, and even imprisonment.
2. Anti-apostasy laws: Some African countries have anti-apostasy laws that criminalize the act of renouncing one's religion. While these laws are often used to persecute religious minorities, they can also be used against strong atheists who reject all forms of belief.
3. Discrimination and stigma: Atheists in Nigeria may face social discrimination and stigma, which can lead to marginalization and exclusion from certain opportunities and resources. This can make it difficult for them to access education, employment, or other basic rights.

6. Cultural and social barriers: Strong atheists in Nigeria may face cultural and social barriers that discourage them from expressing their beliefs openly. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being.
7. Lack of community support: Strong atheists in Nigeria may not have access to a supportive community of like-minded individuals who
