Discrimination against any group of people, including non-citizens in Nigeria, can have significant negative impacts on their mental health. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: Non-citizens in Nigeria may experience increased stress and anxiety due to the uncertainty and insecurity associated with their immigration status. They may constantly worry about their legal status, fear deportation, and feel like they are living in a state of limbo.
2. Low self-esteem and identity issues: Discrimination can lead to feelings of low self-esteem, shame, and embarrassment among non-citizens. They may struggle with their identity and sense of belonging in Nigeria, feeling like they don't fully belong or are not valued members of society.
3. Social isolation: Non-citizens may avoid social interactions or feel excluded from social events due to their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can negatively impact mental health.
4. Depression: The constant stress and discrimination faced by non-citizens can lead to depression, which is characterized by persistent sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities. Depression can also interfere with daily functioning and relationships.
5. PTSD: Non-citizens who have experienced trauma related to discrimination, such as physical or sexual assault, may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms of PTSD include flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance behaviors, and hypervigilance.
6. Suicidal ideation: In extreme cases, non-citizens who experience chronic discrimination may develop suicidal thoughts or behaviors. This can be a result of the cumulative stress and hopelessness they feel due to their immigration status.
7. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Non-citizens may face barriers when seeking mental health services, such as language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, or fear of being reported to immigration authorities.
8. Intergenerational trauma: The impacts of discrimination can be passed down through generations, causing intergenerational trauma and mental health issues
