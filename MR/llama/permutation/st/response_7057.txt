Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed-Caucasian Heritages Nominal Christians

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds. The identity formation process of mixed-Caucasian heritage nominal Christians is complex and multifaceted, as they navigate between different cultural influences and belief systems. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage contributes to the shaping of these individuals' identities.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity formation, particularly in cases where there is a disconnect between their racial or ethnic background and their religious affiliation (Hood, 2013). For mixed-Caucasian heritage nominal Christians, this disconnect can lead to feelings of ambiguity and confusion regarding their identity.

One study found that individuals from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds often experience a sense of "in between-ness" or "neither here nor there," which can make it difficult for them to assert their identity (Gillborn, 2001). This feeling of ambiguity can be particularly challenging in religious contexts, where individuals may feel pressure to conform to dominant cultural norms and belief systems.

Cultural heritage can also shape the identities of mixed-Caucasian heritage nominal Christians through the transmission of values, traditions, and practices from their ancestors (Bourdieu, 1990). For example, an individual may inherit cultural practices or religious beliefs from their maternal or paternal lineage, which can influence their sense of identity and belonging.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with mixed-Caucasian heritage nominal Christians to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping their identities. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, and interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes related to cultural heritage and identity formation.

Expected Findings:
This study aims to contribute to the understanding of how cultural heritage influences
