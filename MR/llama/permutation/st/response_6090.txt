It is important to recognize that the healthcare needs of Mexican non-lower-class people are not being met due to a variety of factors, including lack of access, affordability, and quality of care. Here are some potential solutions to address these issues:

1. Increase access to healthcare: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare in Mexico is geographical location. Many rural areas have limited access to healthcare facilities, making it difficult for people living in these areas to receive quality care. To address this issue, investment in healthcare infrastructure and transportation could be prioritized to improve access to healthcare for all communities.
2. Improve affordability: Many Mexicans struggle to afford healthcare due to the high out-of-pocket costs associated with seeking medical care. To address this issue, reforms could be implemented to reduce the financial burden on patients, such as implementing a universal healthcare system or increasing government subsidies for healthcare expenses.
3. Enhance quality of care: Despite advances in medical technology and training, many Mexicans still do not have access to high-quality healthcare due to a shortage of trained healthcare professionals or inadequate infrastructure. To address this issue, investment in healthcare education and training could be prioritized to improve the quality of care available to all communities.
4. Address social determinants of health: Many factors beyond access to healthcare can impact an individual's ability to maintain good health, such as poverty, malnutrition, and lack of access to clean water and sanitation. To address these social determinants of health, policies could be implemented to reduce poverty and improve living conditions for all communities.
5. Promote community-based care: Community-based care models have shown promise in addressing the healthcare needs of marginalized populations, including those in rural areas. These models prioritize the involvement of local communities in healthcare decision-making and delivery, which can lead to more culturally sensitive and effective care.
6. Foster collaboration between NGOs and government: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often have a wealth of experience and expertise in addressing the healthcare needs of marginalized populations. Collaboration between NGOs and government can help to leverage these resources and improve
