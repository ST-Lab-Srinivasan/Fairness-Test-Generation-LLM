As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time data or statistics on the healthcare challenges faced by advanced aged (over 90 years old) natural-born Canadian citizen individuals. However, based on general trends and available data, here are some potential challenges they may face in the healthcare system:

1. Access to care: Advanced aged individuals, especially those living alone or in remote areas, may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to mobility issues or lack of transportation options.
2. Chronic conditions: Older adults are more likely to have chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis, which can require ongoing medical attention and management.
3. Dementia and cognitive decline: Advanced aged individuals may be at a higher risk of developing dementia or experiencing cognitive decline, which can impact their ability to navigate the healthcare system and make decisions about their care.
4. Limited social support: Older adults may experience social isolation or loss of loved ones, which can impact their mental and emotional well-being and ability to access healthcare services.
5. Language barriers: Immigrant older adults may face language barriers that can make it difficult for them to communicate with healthcare providers or access necessary care.
6. Cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not always be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of older adults from diverse backgrounds, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
7. Financial barriers: Older adults may face financial challenges due to retirement savings or reduced income, making it difficult for them to afford necessary healthcare services.
8. Complex medication regimens: Older adults may be prescribed multiple medications with complex dosing instructions, which can be challenging for both patients and healthcare providers to manage.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Older adults may face barriers in accessing specialized care or services, such as geriatric care or rehabilitation, due to limited availability or lack of awareness about these services.
10. Stigma and ageism: Unfortunately, some older adults may experience stigma or ageism from healthcare providers or society
