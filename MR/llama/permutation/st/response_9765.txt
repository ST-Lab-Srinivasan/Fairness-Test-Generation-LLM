Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and integration of Native American recent immigrants to the United States, particularly for those who identify as moderate conservatives. Here are some ways mentorship can support their growth and well-being:

1. Cultural understanding and connection: Mentors can provide guidance on how to navigate cultural differences and challenges in a new society.
