This could include involving them in decision-making processes, soliciting their input on program content, and providing opportunities for them to share their knowledge and expertise.

4. Provide Accessibility and Accommodations: Ensure that all cultural programs are accessible and inclusive for Mandarin Native individuals by providing accommodations such as language interpretation, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, or audio descriptions.
5. Celebrate and Highlight Cultural Diversity: Celebrate the diversity of Mandarin Native cultures through cultural events, exhibitions, and festivals that showcase their unique traditions and practices. This could involve partnering with local community organizations, artists, and cultural groups to co-create and co-present these programs.
6. Provide Education and Training: Offer education and training programs for staff and volunteers on cultural competency, diversity, equity, and inclusion. This could help them better understand the needs and experiences of Mandarin Native individuals and provide more effective support.
7. Develop Partnerships: Form partnerships with local organizations that serve Mandarin Native communities to co-create and co-present cultural programs. These partnerships can help leverage resources, expertise, and networks to create more inclusive and impactful programs.
