As a non-conservative immigrant natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that I have faced in the healthcare system:

1. Language barriers: As a non-native English speaker, I face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers who may not speak my native language fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications about my medical history or treatment plans.
2. Cultural barriers: Different cultures have different beliefs and practices when it comes to healthcare. As a non-US citizen, I may have different expectations and preferences when it comes to my care, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts with my healthcare providers.
3. Access to care: As a low-income immigrant, I may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to lack of insurance or financial resources. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative consequences for my health.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or immigration status is still prevalent in the US healthcare system. As a non-white immigrant, I may face discrimination from healthcare providers or staff, which can affect the quality of care I receive.
5. Lack of cultural competency: The US healthcare system often lacks cultural competence when it comes to caring for patients from diverse backgrounds. As a non-US citizen, I may face inadequate understanding or misdiagnosis due to a lack of knowledge about my culture and beliefs.
6. Limited access to specialized care: As a non-conservative immigrant, I may have limited access to specialized care due to language barriers or lack of insurance coverage. This can result in delayed or inadequate care for complex conditions.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The US healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with it. As a non-US citizen, I may face challenges in understanding my rights and responsibilities as a patient, which can lead to difficulties in accessing care.
8. Stigma and shame: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to seeking healthcare as an immigrant
