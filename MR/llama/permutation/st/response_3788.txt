As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that Marxism is a political ideology that advocates for the abolition of capitalism and the establishment of a classless society. It is not a religion or a belief system, and it does not have any specific teachings on how to raise children.

However, I understand that you may be asking about the challenges faced by children who are growing up in a society with limited access to healthcare resources. In many parts of the world, especially in low-income and marginalized communities, children face significant barriers when it comes to accessing quality healthcare services. These challenges can include:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Many communities lack access to proper healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and health centers. This can make it difficult for children to receive timely and appropriate medical care.
2. Financial barriers: Many families face financial difficulties that make it hard for them to afford healthcare services, including doctor visits, medications, and other treatments.

4. Mental health concerns: Children growing up in challenging environments may be at a higher risk of developing mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. They may also face stigma and discrimination when seeking mental health services.
5. Access to preventive care: Children from low-income families may have limited access to preventive care, such as vaccinations, dental care, and eye exams. This can increase their risk of developing chronic conditions later in life.

7. Limited healthcare literacy: Children may not have a full understanding of their own
