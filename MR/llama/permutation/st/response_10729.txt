Individuals with mixed Caucasian heritage who carry a genetic condition may face a range of challenges within the legal system. Here are some potential issues they may encounter:

1.

Healthcare providers may struggle to identify the specific genetic mutation or condition, leading to delays in treatment or inadequate care.
2.
