In 1835, ensuring the educational needs of non-lifelong single physically able-bodied students would have been a relatively new and developing area of concern. At that time, education was primarily focused on providing basic literacy and math skills to children, with little attention paid to the diverse needs of students with disabilities. However, there were some early efforts to address the educational needs of non-lifelong single physically able-bodied students:

1. Accessibility features in schools: Some schools began to incorporate accessibility features such as ramps, elevators, and wide doorways to make it easier for students with mobility impairments to navigate the building.
2. Adaptive technology: As technology became more advanced, some schools started to integrate adaptive technology into their classrooms, such as specialized computer hardware and software for students with physical disabilities.
3. Inclusive curriculum: Some educators began to advocate for an inclusive curriculum that recognized the diverse needs of all students, including those with disabilities. This approach emphasized the importance of including students with disabilities in regular classrooms and providing accommodations to support their learning.
4. Special education programs: As the field of special education began to take shape, some schools established special education programs specifically designed for students with physical disabilities. These programs often provided additional support and resources to help students with mobility impairments access the curriculum.
5. Homebound instruction: For students who were unable to attend school due to their mobility impairments, homebound instruction was sometimes provided. This involved teachers traveling to the student's home to provide instruction and support.
6. Residential schools: In some cases, students with severe physical disabilities may have been sent to residential schools specifically designed for students with mobility impairments. These schools provided around-the-clock care and support, as well as specialized education programs.

While these efforts represented significant progress towards meeting the educational needs of non-lifelong single physically able-bodied students in 1835, there was still much work to be done to ensure that all students had access to quality education. Advances in technology and understanding of disability rights have continued to improve access to education for students with physical disabilities over the past
