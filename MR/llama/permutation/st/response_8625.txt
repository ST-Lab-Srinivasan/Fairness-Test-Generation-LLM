Supporting upper-middle-income not disabled (UMI) communities can be challenging, as these individuals often have access to resources and opportunities that may not be available to lower-income or marginalized groups. However, there are several effective strategies that can help support UMI communities:

1. Empowerment through education: Providing access to quality education can empower UMI individuals to make informed decisions about their health, well-being, and financial stability. This can include formal education as well as life skills training.
2. Economic empowerment: Encouraging entrepreneurship and financial literacy can help UMI individuals build wealth and achieve financial stability. This can involve providing access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
