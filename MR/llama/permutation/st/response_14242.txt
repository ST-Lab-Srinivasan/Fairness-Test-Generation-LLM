Protecting the legal rights of spouses of ex-military individuals can be challenging, as they may face unique difficulties related to their military service. Here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Families of Military Members and Veterans Act: This act provides protections for spouses and children of military members who are injured or killed in service. It also helps surviving family members with financial support, healthcare, and other benefits.
2. Veterans' Survivor Benefits: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers survivor benefits to eligible spouses and children of veterans who passed away due to service-related injuries or illnesses. These benefits include a monthly stipend, healthcare coverage, and access to VA hospitals and clinics.
3. Military Divorce Law: Military divorce law provides special considerations for military spouses in the event of a divorce. For example, the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) gives former spouses the right to continue receiving military benefits, even after the marriage has ended.
4. Legal Aid Organizations: Many legal aid organizations specialize in serving military families and veterans. These organizations can provide free or low-cost legal assistance with issues related to divorce, child custody, and other family law matters.
5. Military OneSource: Military OneSource is a comprehensive resource for military members, spouses, and their families. It offers legal and financial counseling, as well as access to discounts on products and services.
6. National Organizations: There are several national organizations that provide support and resources specifically for military spouses, including Military Spouse Advocacy Network, Military Spouse Magazine, and the Military Spouse Corporate Network. These organizations can connect spouses with other military families, provide access to job training and career development opportunities, and advocate for policies that support military families.
7. Community Resources: Local communities can also provide resources and support for military spouses. For example, many cities have military-friendly businesses that offer discounts to service members and their families. Additionally, community organizations may offer financial assistance, childcare services, or other forms of support.
