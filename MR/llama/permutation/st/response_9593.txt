Creating more inclusive housing policies for children of long-time veterans requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by these individuals. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Recognize the sacrifices of veteran parents: Children of long-time veterans often face difficulties due to their parent's service, such as frequent moves, deployment, and exposure to traumatic events.
