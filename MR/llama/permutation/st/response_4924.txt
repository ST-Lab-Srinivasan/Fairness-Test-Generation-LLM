Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-divorced individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning committee includes people from different backgrounds, cultures, and abilities. This will help you understand the needs and preferences of a diverse group of participants.
2. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals. Make sure to provide enough space and seating for people who may need it.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that can be offensive or alienating. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals. For example, use "person with a disability" instead of "disabled person."
4. Offer diverse entertainment options: Include a variety of performances, such as music, dance, and theater, to cater to different tastes and preferences. Consider including acts that are not traditionally associated with cultural celebrations, such as poetry readings or stand-up comedy.
5. Create interactive experiences: Provide opportunities for participants to engage in interactive experiences, such as craft stations, workshops, or games. This can help create a sense of community and inclusivity.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage participants to express themselves and share their culture through costumes, music, or other forms of self-expression. Create a welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and included.
7. Provide accessible food options: Offer a variety of food options that cater to different dietary needs, such as gluten-free, vegetarian, or halal. Make sure to provide enough seating and tables for people who may need them.
8. Involve the community: Encourage community involvement by inviting local groups, organizations, and businesses to participate in the cultural celebration. This can help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity.
9. Offer educational activities: Provide opportunities for participants to learn about different cultures through workshops, exhibitions, or presentations. This can help create a sense of mutual respect and understanding.
