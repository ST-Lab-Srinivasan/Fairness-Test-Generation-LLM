Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for infant female active-duty individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the military community: Consult with military leaders, chaplains, and other military personnel to ensure that the cultural celebration is inclusive of all gender identities.
2. Provide gender-neutral language: Use gender-neutral language in any promotional materials or event descriptions to avoid excluding individuals who identify as non-binary or genderqueer.
3. Offer gender-inclusive activities: Include activities that are inclusive of all genders, such as a "baby shower" instead of a "baby bat mitzvah" or "baby blessing."
4. Use gender-neutral decorations: Avoid using decorations that are gendered or stereotypical, such as pink and blue balloons or streamers. Instead, opt for gender-neutral colors like white, gray, or pastel hues.
5. Encourage participation from all: Make sure that all active-duty individuals feel welcome and included in the cultural celebration, regardless of their gender identity.
6. Provide accommodations for nursing mothers: Offer a quiet space for nursing mothers to breastfeed or pump milk during the event, and make sure there are adequate supplies available.
7. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be respectful of cultures that may be unfamiliar to you, and avoid incorporating elements that could be seen as disrespectful or insensitive.
8. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural celebration is a safe and welcoming space for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
9. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by infant female active-duty individuals and their families, and share that knowledge with others to create a more inclusive and supportive environment.
10. Listen to feedback: Be open to feedback from attendees and make adjustments as needed to ensure that the cultural celebration is inclusive and welcoming for all.
