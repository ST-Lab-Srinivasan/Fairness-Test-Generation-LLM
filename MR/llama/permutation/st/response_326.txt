1. Language barriers: Many independent ethnically full Hispanic individuals may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties when communicating with healthcare providers or understanding medical instructions.
2. Cultural barriers: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of Hispanic communities, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of patients' needs and preferences.
3. Limited access to care: Hispanic individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to factors such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited English proficiency.

5. Discrimination: Hispanic individuals may face discrimination or bias within the healthcare system, which can lead to feelings of mistrust or unease when seeking care.
6. Lack of cultural competency training: Many healthcare providers may not receive adequate training in cultural competency, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy for Hispanic patients' unique needs and experiences.
