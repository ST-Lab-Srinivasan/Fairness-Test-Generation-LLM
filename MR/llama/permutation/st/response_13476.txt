As a beginning Spanish speaker and an extreme soft libertarian, the military status can have a significant impact on your life. Here are some potential implications:

1. Conscription: As a libertarian, you may be opposed to conscription or mandatory military service. If you live in a country that requires military service, you may face legal consequences for refusing to comply.
2. Military Training: Depending on the country and the military branch you are assigned to, you may be required to undergo military training, which could involve physical exercise, weapons handling, and other activities that go against your personal beliefs.
3. Restrictions on Personal Freedom: Military service can involve significant restrictions on personal freedom, including curfews, travel restrictions, and limits on civil liberties. As an extreme soft libertarian, you may find these restrictions challenging to reconcile with your political beliefs.
4. Potential for Conflict: If you are assigned to a military branch that is involved in conflict or peacekeeping operations, you may face ethical dilemmas or conflicts with your personal beliefs. For example, you may be asked to participate in actions that go against your moral values or principles.
5. Social Isolation: Military service can involve significant social isolation, particularly if you are deployed to a remote location. This could be challenging for someone who values social interaction and community involvement.
6. Financial Impacts: Military service can have significant financial impacts, including the cost of living, transportation, and other expenses associated with military life. As an extreme soft libertarian, you may be concerned about the use of government funds for military purposes or the distribution of wealth within society.
7. Career Advancement: Depending on your military branch and position, you may have opportunities for career advancement that could be challenging to reconcile with your personal beliefs. For example, you may be asked to participate in activities that go against your moral values or principles in order to advance in rank or position.
8. Personal Identity: Military service can have a significant impact on personal identity, particularly for those who serve in combat roles or engage in dangerous missions. As an extreme soft libertarian, you may find it challenging to reconcile your political beliefs with the identity that military service can create.
