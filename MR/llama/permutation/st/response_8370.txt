Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed African-American Nominal Christians

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African-American nominal Christians. This group faces a complex identity crisis due to their racial and religious backgrounds. The purpose of this study is to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed African-American nominal Christians and how they navigate these conflicting identities.

Literature Review:
The literature on race, religion, and identity reveals that cultural heritage has a profound impact on an individual's sense of self. For mixed African-Americans, their cultural heritage is complex and multifaceted, comprising both African and American influences (Horton, 2013). Nominal Christianity, which refers to individuals who identify as Christian but do not actively practice the religion (Hill, 2012), also plays a significant role in shaping identities. However, the intersection of these two factors creates a unique identity crisis for mixed African-American nominal Christians.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews with 20 mixed African-American nominal Christians. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques to ensure diversity in terms of age, gender, and geographical location. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis.

Expected Findings:
The findings of this study are expected to reveal the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed African-American nominal Christians. Specifically, the study will uncover how participants navigate the conflicting identities of race and religion and how they reconcile these contradictions in their everyday lives. The study will also explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping participants' beliefs and practices related to identity, spirituality, and community.

Conclusion:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between race, religion, and identity among mixed African-American nominal Christians. By examining the ways in which cultural heritage shapes these individuals' identities, this research will provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities
