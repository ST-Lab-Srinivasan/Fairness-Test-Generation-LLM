As a native French speaker who has recently turned 65, there are several challenges that I may face in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues that older adults in France can encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: As we age, our healthcare needs can change, and it's not always easy to access the right care at the right time. There may be long wait times for appointments or specialized care, which can be challenging for older adults who need prompt attention.
2. Language barriers: While France has a reputation for having excellent healthcare, there may be language barriers for native French speakers who are not fluent in the local language. This can make it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers or understand medical instructions.
3. Cultural differences: As we age, our cultural background and values can affect how we approach healthcare. For example, some older adults may prefer more traditional or holistic approaches to healthcare, which can be challenging to navigate in a primarily Western-oriented system.
4. Limited mobility: Older adults may experience decreased mobility, which can make it difficult to get to healthcare appointments or access healthcare facilities. This can be especially challenging for those who live in rural areas or have limited transportation options.
5. Complex medical needs: As we age, our bodies undergo natural changes that can lead to complex medical needs. For example, older adults may experience chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, or heart disease, which can be challenging to manage without proper care and support.
6. Mental health concerns: Older adults may experience mental health concerns such as depression, anxiety, or cognitive decline, which can affect their ability to navigate the healthcare system.
7. Lack of trust in the system: Some older adults may have had negative experiences with the healthcare system in the past, leading to a lack of trust in the system. This can make it difficult for them to seek care or follow medical advice.
8. Limited social support: Older adults may experience social isolation or limited social support, which can affect their ability to access and navigate the healthcare system.
9. Difficulty navigating electronic health records: Many healthcare providers use electronic health records
