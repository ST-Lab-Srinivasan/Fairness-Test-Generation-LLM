Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for documented non-socialist individuals can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Understand and acknowledge the diversity of beliefs and opinions within a community: Recognize that people have different perspectives and beliefs, and that it is important to respect and appreciate these differences.
2. Involve a diverse group of individuals in the planning process: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of the community.
3. Provide opportunities for participation: Make sure that there are opportunities for everyone to participate in the celebration, regardless of their political views or affiliations. This can include inviting individuals to share their cultural practices or traditions, or providing a platform for them to express their thoughts and opinions.
4. Foster a culture of mutual respect: Encourage individuals to listen to and learn from one another's perspectives, and to engage in open and respectful dialogue.
5. Avoid divisive language or imagery: Refrain from using language or imagery that may be perceived as exclusionary or offensive to any group of people.
6. Encourage cultural exchange: Provide opportunities for individuals to learn about and appreciate different cultures, traditions, and beliefs. This can help promote understanding and respect between different groups of people.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Recognize that certain groups may have more privilege or influence than others, and work to mitigate these imbalances in the planning process.
8. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or limitations. This can include providing accommodations such as sign language interpreters, wheelchair accessibility, or braille materials.
9. Be adaptable: Be willing to make changes or adjustments to the celebration as needed, based on feedback and input from diverse groups of individuals
