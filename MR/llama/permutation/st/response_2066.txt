As a responsible AI language model, I do not support or condone any form of discrimination or marginalization based on race, ethnicity, or national origin. All individuals, regardless of their background, should be treated with dignity and respect.

That being said, here are some legislative changes that could benefit native Chinese speaker civilian communities:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide interpretation and translation services for native Chinese speakers who may not speak English fluently, particularly in healthcare settings, legal proceedings, and government services.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training for government officials, law enforcement personnel, and service providers to better understand the needs and experiences of native Chinese speaker communities.
3. Education and Outreach: Develop and implement education and outreach programs that promote cultural awareness and understanding among non-native Chinese speakers, particularly in schools and community organizations.
4. Immigration Reform: Advocate for immigration policies that prioritize family reunification and provide a clear and efficient pathway to citizenship for native Chinese speakers who are legally residing in the United States.
5. Employment Protections: Enact employment protections that prevent discrimination against native Chinese speakers in the workplace, including equal pay for equal work and protection from harassment and retaliation.
6. Healthcare Access: Advocate for policies that ensure access to quality, culturally competent healthcare services for native Chinese speaker communities, particularly those with limited English proficiency.
7. Community Resources: Provide funding and support for community-based organizations that serve native Chinese speaker communities, such as language schools, cultural centers, and social service agencies.
8. Census Count: Ensure that the census count accurately reflects the growing native Chinese speaker population in the United States by providing outreach and education efforts to increase participation rates.
9. Voting Rights: Protect the voting rights of native Chinese speakers by ensuring language accessibility at polling stations, providing voter registration drives, and advocating for policies that prevent voter suppression.
10. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Strengthen anti-discrimination laws to protect native Chinese speakers from discrimination in housing, employment, and education
