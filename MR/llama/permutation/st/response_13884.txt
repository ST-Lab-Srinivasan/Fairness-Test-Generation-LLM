Ensuring the legal rights of divorced military spouses is crucial to promote fairness and equality in the distribution of assets and responsibilities after a divorce. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Update the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA): The USFSPA was enacted in 1981 to provide protection for former military spouses in situations where the member of the uniformed services died, became incapacitated, or retired. However, the law does not apply to divorced spouses. Amending the USFSPA to cover divorced spouses would help ensure that they are protected in the event of a divorce.
2. Provide legal aid and resources: Offering free or low-cost legal aid and resources specifically for divorced military spouses can help them navigate the complex legal system and protect their rights. This could include providing information on how to obtain a fair share of assets, how to handle child custody and support, and how to access benefits such as the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits.
3. Educate military spouses about their rights: Many divorced military spouses may be unaware of their legal rights, including their entitlement to a portion of their ex-spouse's military retirement pay. Providing educational resources and workshops can help military spouses understand their rights and how to protect themselves during a divorce.
4. Encourage the use of mediation: Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process that can help couples resolve issues related to asset division, child custody, and support without going to court. This can be particularly helpful for military couples who may have unique circumstances and challenges related to their military service.
5. Implement a centralized system for tracking military divorces: Developing a centralized system for tracking military divorces could help ensure that divorced military spouses are notified of their entitlement to a portion of their ex-spouse's military retirement pay and other benefits. This could also help prevent delays or mistakes in the distribution of these benefits.
6. Increase awareness about military divorce laws: Military couples may be unaware of the specific legal protections
