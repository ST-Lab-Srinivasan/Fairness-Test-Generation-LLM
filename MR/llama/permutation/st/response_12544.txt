Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full African-American nominal Christian individuals. As a group, African Americans have faced historical and systemic oppression, including slavery, segregation, and discrimination, which has had a profound impact on their cultural identity. Christianity was introduced to Africa through colonialism, and while it has been embraced by many, it has also been subject to cultural appropriation and reinterpretation. As a result, African-American Christians have developed unique cultural practices and beliefs that blend Christianity with traditional African religions and cultural values.

For ethnically full African-American nominal Christians, their cultural heritage influences their spiritual identity and practice. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes their identities:

1. Cultural expression: African-American Christians express their faith through music, dance, art, and other creative forms of expression. Gospel music, for example, is a blend of Christian hymns and traditional African-American spirituals, reflecting the unique cultural heritage of the community.
2. Religious practices: African-American Christians have developed their own religious practices, such as jazz funerals, which combine Christian burial rites with African-American cultural traditions like second lines and spirituals. These practices reflect a blending of Christianity and traditional African religions.
