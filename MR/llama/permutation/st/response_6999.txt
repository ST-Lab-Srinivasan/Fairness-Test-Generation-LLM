Creating more inclusive social policies for non-in relationship permanent residents (NIRPRs) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Acknowledge and recognize NIRPRs: The first step is to acknowledge and recognize NIRPRs as a distinct group, with their own set of challenges and needs. This can involve collecting data and conducting research to better understand their experiences and perspectives.
2. Address discrimination and stigma: NIRPRs often face discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status or non-traditional family structure. Policies should aim to reduce these forms of discrimination and promote a more inclusive society.
3. Ensure access to basic rights and services: NIRPRs should have equal access to basic rights and services, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. Policies should aim to remove barriers to these services and ensure that they are available to all, regardless of immigration status.
4. Promote social cohesion: Social policies should aim to promote social cohesion and inclusion, by fostering a sense of belonging and connection among NIRPRs and the broader community. This can involve promoting cultural exchange programs, intercultural dialogue, and community-building initiatives.
5. Support family reunification: Many NIRPRs are separated from their families due to immigration restrictions or other barriers. Policies should aim to support family reunification and ensure that NIRPRs have access to legal and affordable pathways for family reunification.
6. Provide financial support: NIRPRs often face economic insecurity and poverty, which can exacerbate their marginalization. Policies should aim to provide financial support and resources, such as access to affordable housing, microfinance programs, and job training initiatives.
7. Advocate for policy change: Many of the challenges faced by NIRPRs are the result of discriminatory policies and practices. Policies should aim to advocate for policy change at the local, national, and international levels, to address these issues and promote a more inclusive and equitable society.
8. Engage with NGOs and community groups
