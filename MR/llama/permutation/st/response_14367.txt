As a progressive beginner Arabic speaker, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in many countries is primarily conducted in the local language, which can create a significant barrier for non-native speakers. As an Arabic speaker, you may struggle to understand complex legal terminology and procedures, especially if the language is not your native tongue.
2. Limited access to resources: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to legal resources such as books, websites, or even lawyers who speak Arabic. This can make it difficult to research and understand the laws that apply to you.
3. Lack of representation: As a non-native speaker, you may find it challenging to find a lawyer who is fluent in both the local language and Arabic. This can limit your ability to advocate for yourself in legal matters.
4. Cultural differences: The legal system can be complex and unfamiliar to those who are not familiar with the culture and customs of the country. As an Arabic speaker, you may face challenges navigating a legal system that is based on different cultural norms and values.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-native speakers may face discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are from a minority group. As an Arabic speaker, you may encounter biases or prejudices that can affect your ability to access justice.
6. Difficulty navigating procedures: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with the procedures and protocols. As an Arabic speaker, you may find it challenging to understand the nuances of the legal process and how to comply with the requirements.
7. Limited knowledge of local laws: Depending on where you live, there may be specific laws and regulations that apply to non-native speakers. As an Arabic speaker, you may not be aware of these laws and regulations, which can put you at a disadvantage in legal matters.
8. Difficulty communicating with authorities: In some countries, communication with government agencies and law enforcement officials may be challenging for non-native speakers. As an Arabic speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate effectively with these authorities
