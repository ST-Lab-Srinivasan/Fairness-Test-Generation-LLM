Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class natural-born US citizen people are met is crucial for promoting equity and improving overall health outcomes. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Expand Medicaid coverage: One of the primary challenges faced by low-income individuals is access to affordable healthcare. Expanding Medicaid coverage can help bridge this gap, ensuring that more people have access to quality medical care.
2. Increase funding for community health clinics: Community health clinics provide essential primary care services to underserved populations. Increasing funding for these clinics can help improve their capacity and better serve the needs of lower-class individuals.
3. Implement a public option health insurance plan: A public option health insurance plan can provide an affordable alternative to private insurance plans, which may be out of reach for many low-income individuals. This can help increase access to healthcare and improve overall health outcomes.
4. Invest in preventive care: Many lower-class individuals may lack access to preventive care services, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations. Investing in these services can help identify health issues early on and prevent more serious problems from developing.
5. Address cultural and linguistic barriers: Lower-class individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to cultural or linguistic differences. Healthcare providers must be sensitive to these barriers and take steps to address them, such as providing interpreters and culturally competent care.
6. Improve mental health services: Mental health issues are prevalent among lower-class individuals, but they often lack access to adequate mental health services. Investing in mental health services can help improve overall health outcomes and address the social determinants of health.
7. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants, such as housing, food security, and education, have a significant impact on health outcomes. Addressing these factors can help improve health equity and reduce health disparities.
8. Support community-based initiatives: Community-based initiatives, such as community gardens and nutrition programs, can help promote healthy behaviors and address food insecurity among lower-class individuals.
