3. Access to Markets: Facilitate access to markets for Mandarin-speaking Muslim entrepreneurs by providing information on potential customers, suppliers, and partners. This can be done through trade missions, business fairs, and online platforms.
4. Skills Development: Provide training and development programs in skills such as digital literacy, vocational training, and language proficiency to help community members enhance their employability and earning potential.
5. Social Enterprise Support: Encourage and support social enterprises that address the needs of Mandarin-speaking Muslim communities. This can include providing funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
