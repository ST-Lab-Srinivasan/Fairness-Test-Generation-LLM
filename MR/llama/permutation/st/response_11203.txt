Creating more inclusive social policies for Nigerian devout practicing Hindu individuals requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the unique needs and practices of this religious community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Education and Awareness: Organize workshops, seminars, and public events to educate government officials, civil society organizations, and the general public about the beliefs, practices, and cultural nuances of Hinduism in Nigeria. This will help create a better understanding and appreciation of the community's needs and concerns.
2. Legal Recognition: Advocate for legal recognition of Hinduism as an official religion in Nigeria, which will provide a framework for the protection of Hindu rights and interests. This could include the establishment of a National Hindu Council or the recognition of Hindu temples and institutions.
3. Cultural Exchange Programs: Organize cultural exchange programs between Nigerian Hindus and their counterparts in India or other parts of the world. This will help promote mutual understanding, respect, and appreciation for each other's cultural practices and traditions.
4. Access to Healthcare: Advocate for improved access to healthcare services for Nigerian Hindus, including traditional medicine and spiritual healing practices. This could involve partnerships with local hospitals and clinics to provide affordable and culturally sensitive healthcare services.

6. Representation in Government: Advocate for the representation of Nigerian Hindus in government institutions, including at the local, state, and federal levels. This could involve the appointment of Hindu representatives to advisory boards, committees, or councils, or the establishment of a National Hindu Representative Body.
7. Protection of Places of Worship: Advocate for the protection of Hindu places of worship in Nigeria, including temples, shrines, and other religious sites. This could involve the establishment of a special task force to monitor and protect these sites from vandalism or destruction.
