As a native Chinese speaker and beginner French speaker, there may be several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barriers: One of the biggest challenges for native Chinese speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. While many legal documents and proceedings are conducted in French, not all legal professionals may be fluent in Chinese. This can make it difficult to understand legal terminology and procedures, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
2. Cultural differences: China and France have different legal systems, cultures, and traditions. As a result, there may be cultural differences that can affect the way legal proceedings are conducted. For example, in China, the concept of "guilt by association" is not recognized, while in France, it is. Understanding these cultural differences is essential to navigating the legal system effectively.

For example, the term "droit" in French means "right," while in Chinese, it means "law." Understanding these differences is crucial to communicating effectively with French-speaking legal professionals.
