Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Casual Buddhist Individuals during Early Pregnancy (1st Trimester)

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly during early pregnancy (1st trimester). As casual Buddhists, these individuals are likely to be influenced by their cultural background and beliefs. This study aims to investigate how cultural heritage affects the identities of casual Buddhist individuals during this critical period of life.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can significantly impact an individual's identity formation, particularly during early adulthood (Hall & Hood, 1987). Cultural heritage includes the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society. For casual Buddhists, their cultural heritage may include the teachings of the Buddha and the practices of meditation, mindfulness, and compassion.

During early pregnancy (1st trimester), individuals are likely to experience significant physical, emotional, and social changes. These changes can lead to a re-evaluation of one's identity and values. For casual Buddhists, their cultural heritage may provide a sense of security and belonging during this time of uncertainty.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with a sample of 20 casual Buddhist individuals during early pregnancy (1st trimester). Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and convenience sampling. The interviews will be conducted via video conferencing or in-person, depending on the participant's preference.

Data Analysis:
The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and trends in the participants' narratives. The findings will be organized into categories and subcategories, and the data will be synthesized to identify the main themes emerging from the data.

Expected Findings:
This study is expected to reveal several themes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of casual Buddhist individuals during early pregn
