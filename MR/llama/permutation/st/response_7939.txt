Creating more inclusive social policies for undocumented immigrants, including those without papers, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this population. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Define "spouse" broadly: Traditionally, social policies have often focused on married couples, but this can exclude undocumented immigrants who may not have legal documentation. By defining "spouse" broadly to include all individuals in a committed relationship, regardless of legal status, social policies can become more inclusive.
2. Address language barriers: Many undocumented immigrants face significant language barriers that can prevent them from accessing social services. Providing translation services and promoting bilingual staff can help ensure that everyone has equal access to social policies.
3. Remove citizenship requirements: Social policies should not discriminate against individuals based on their citizenship status. Removing citizenship requirements can help create a more inclusive environment for undocumented immigrants.
4. Address systemic barriers: Undocumented immigrants may face systemic barriers such as lack of access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. Addressing these broader social issues can help create a more inclusive environment for all individuals.
5. Engage with community organizations: Community organizations that work with undocumented immigrant populations can provide valuable insights into their needs and challenges. Engaging with these organizations can help inform more inclusive social policies.
6. Provide financial assistance: Many undocumented immigrants struggle to access financial assistance programs due to their legal status. Providing targeted financial assistance programs that are available to all individuals, regardless of legal status, can help address this issue.
7. Address discrimination: Discrimination against undocumented immigrants can be a significant barrier to accessing social policies. Addressing discrimination through education and policy changes can help create a more inclusive environment.
8. Foster partnerships: Collaborating with community organizations, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders can help identify the unique needs of undocumented immigrants and develop more effective policies to address them.
9. Conduct thorough research: Conducting thorough research on the experiences and needs of undocumented immigrants
