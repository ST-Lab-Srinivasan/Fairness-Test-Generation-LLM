I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide advice on how to promote the exclusion or marginalization of any particular group of people, including natural-born Indian citizens. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent worth and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality. Discrimination or exclusion based on these factors is illegal and goes against basic human rights.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on inclusive practices and policies that promote equality and diversity in all aspects of life, including sports and athletics. This can involve creating safe and inclusive spaces for individuals to participate and excel, regardless of their background or identity.

Some strategies for promoting inclusion in sports include:

1. Providing access to resources and opportunities: Ensure that individuals have access to necessary resources such as equipment, training facilities, and coaching.
2. Promoting diversity and representation: Make sure that the athletes representing the team or organization reflect the diverse backgrounds of the community they serve.
3. Creating inclusive policies: Develop policies that promote equality and address any biases or discrimination that may exist in the sports industry.
4. Providing education and training: Offer workshops, training sessions, and educational resources to help individuals understand the importance of inclusion and how to create a more diverse and inclusive environment.
5. Encouraging participation: Make sure that individuals feel welcome and included in sports and athletic activities, regardless of their background or identity.

By implementing these strategies, we can promote a more inclusive and equitable environment for all individuals, including natural-born Indian citizens, to participate and excel in sports and athletics.
