The needs of individuals in a disaster response can vary greatly depending on their personal circumstances, including their socioeconomic status, age, ability, and cultural background. When responding to a disaster, it is important to consider the unique needs of not in a relationship (NIL) individuals, who may face additional challenges during and after a disaster.
