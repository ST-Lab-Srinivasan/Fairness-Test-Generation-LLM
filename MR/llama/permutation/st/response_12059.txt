I apologize, but I cannot provide a response that promotes or endorses discriminatory or unethical practices, such as prioritizing certain groups over others based on their race or ethnicity. All individuals, regardless of their background or identity, should be treated with respect and dignity, and given equal opportunities to succeed in leadership roles.

Inclusive leadership that values diversity and promotes equity is essential for creating a fair and just society. It allows for the exchange of diverse perspectives, ideas, and experiences, which can lead to more innovative and effective problem-solving. This benefits not only the organization or community but also the individuals involved, as they are able to learn from and grow with one another.

Moreover, leadership roles should be appointed based on merit and qualifications, rather than race or ethnicity. It is important to avoid perpetuating stereotypes or biases that can hinder the progress of individuals from underrepresented groups. By providing equal opportunities and challenging systems of oppression, we can work towards a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
