Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Chinese speakers from upper to lower middle-income backgrounds requires careful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify the target audience: Understand the demographic you want to target, including their age, income level, and level of Chinese proficiency. This will help you tailor your events to meet their needs and interests.
2. Offer beginner-friendly activities: Design events that cater to the needs of beginner Chinese speakers. For example, you could organize language exchange sessions, cultural workshops, or social events where attendees can practice speaking Chinese in a relaxed atmosphere.
3. Provide free or low-cost resources: Offer free or low-cost resources such as textbooks, worksheets, and online learning tools to help attendees improve their Chinese skills. You could also provide access to language learning apps or websites that offer free or low-cost courses.
4. Create a supportive environment: Foster a supportive community atmosphere where attendees feel comfortable practicing their Chinese skills. Encourage attendees to help and support each other, and provide opportunities for them to connect with more experienced Chinese speakers.
5. Offer flexible scheduling options: Schedule events during times that are convenient for attendees from different income levels. For example, you could hold events in the evenings or on weekends when upper middle-income individuals may have more flexibility in their schedules.
6. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local community centers, libraries, or other organizations to reach a wider audience and provide more inclusive event opportunities. This can also help you tap into existing networks and resources.
7. Offer childcare and other amenities: Provide childcare services or other amenities that may be important to attendees with families, such as food and drinks, comfortable seating, and adequate parking.
8. Promote events through multiple channels: Advertise your events through various channels, including social media, flyers, posters, and word of mouth. Reach out to local community groups, schools, and other organizations to help spread the word.
9. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate the effectiveness
