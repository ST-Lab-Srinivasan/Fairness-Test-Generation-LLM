India is a diverse country with a long history of religious harmony, and it is important to continue promoting and protecting this spirit of inclusivity and mutual respect.

2. Promote cultural exchange: Encourage mutual understanding and respect between different religious and cultural groups through events, programs, and initiatives that promote interfaith dialogue and collaboration.
3. Protect religious freedom: Ensure that the rights of all individuals, including natural-born Indian citizens who are secular Jewish, are protected under the law. This includes the right to practice their religion freely, without fear of persecution or discrimination.
