The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their early pregnancy (first trimester) can be significant, particularly for those who are not newly married. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care due to fear of deportation or lack of health insurance. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2.
