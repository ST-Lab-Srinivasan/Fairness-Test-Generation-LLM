Creating more inclusive public policies for not disabled mixed Asian heritage individuals requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the unique experiences and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Collect data and conduct research: To better understand the needs and experiences of mixed Asian heritage individuals, gather data and conduct research on their access to services, opportunities, and outcomes. This will help identify areas where policies can be improved.
2. Consult with community members: Involve mixed Asian heritage individuals in the policy-making process through consultations and surveys. This will ensure that their voices are heard and their perspectives are taken into account.
3. Address intersectionality: Consider how different forms of discrimination (such as racism, ableism, and classism) intersect and affect mixed Asian heritage individuals. Policies should be designed to address these intersections and provide support for individuals facing multiple forms of discrimination.
4. Challenge stereotypes and stigmas: Disabled mixed Asian heritage individuals often face stereotypes and stigma due to their intersectional identity. Policies should challenge these stereotypes and promote inclusive attitudes towards all individuals, regardless of their race or disability status.
5. Provide access to services and opportunities: Ensure that mixed Asian heritage individuals have equal access to services such as education, employment, healthcare, and social welfare programs. Policies should also provide opportunities for them to participate in decision-making processes and influence policies that affect their lives.
6. Support inclusive cultural representation: Encourage the representation of mixed Asian heritage individuals in media, arts, and culture. This can help challenge stereotypes and promote a more inclusive understanding of Asian identity.
7. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent mixed Asian heritage individuals from fully participating in society. This may include addressing discrimination in institutions such as education, employment, and healthcare.
8. Provide accessible infrastructure: Ensure that public spaces and infrastructure are accessible to mixed Asian heritage individuals with disabilities. This can include providing wheelchair-accessible facilities, Braille signage, and audio signals for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
