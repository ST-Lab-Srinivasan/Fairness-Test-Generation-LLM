Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deep in poverty recent immigrants to the US are met is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally sensitive care: Recognize that cultural beliefs and practices play a significant role in an individual's healthcare decisions and experiences. Provide culturally sensitive care by training healthcare providers to understand and respect the cultural differences of the immigrant population.
2. Language access: Ensure that interpretation and translation services are available for patients who may not speak English fluently. This can include hiring interpreters, using telephonic interpretation services, or providing written materials in multiple languages.
3. Community outreach: Engage with local immigrant communities through outreach events, partnering with community-based organizations, and developing culturally tailored health education materials.
4. Health literacy: Provide clear and concise health information that is easy to understand for patients who may have limited English proficiency or who are unfamiliar with the US healthcare system.
5. Patient navigation: Develop patient navigation programs that provide personalized support to immigrant patients throughout their healthcare journey, including assistance with appointment scheduling, medical bill payments, and follow-up care.
6. Partnerships with community clinics: Establish partnerships with community clinics that specialize in serving low-income and uninsured populations, including recent immigrants. These clinics can provide comprehensive primary care and referral services to individuals who may not have access to healthcare through other means.
7. Health insurance outreach: Provide information about available health insurance options, such as Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and assist patients in enrolling in these programs if they are eligible.
8. Mental health support: Recognize that recent immigrants may experience trauma and mental health challenges due to their experiences of displacement, discrimination, and social isolation. Provide culturally sensitive mental health services and refer patients to community-based organizations for additional support.
9. Oral healthcare: Address the oral health disparities that exist among recent immigrant populations by providing culturally sensitive dental care
