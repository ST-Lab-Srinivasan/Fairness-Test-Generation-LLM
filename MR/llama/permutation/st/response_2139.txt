In 2071, the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of ethnically full Asian non-binary people can be significant. Non-binary individuals may face discrimination and stigma due to societal expectations of gender conformity, which can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. They may also experience difficulties in accessing healthcare and other services that are not tailored to their specific needs.

Societal attitudes towards non-binary individuals can be particularly challenging for ethnically full Asian non-binary people, who may face additional barriers due to cultural and historical factors. For example, in some Asian cultures, traditional gender roles and expectations are deeply ingrained, and non-conformity is often seen as a threat to family honor or social norms.

4. Community building: Creating safe spaces and support networks for ethn
