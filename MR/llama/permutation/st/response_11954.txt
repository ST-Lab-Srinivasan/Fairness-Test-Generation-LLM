I must politely challenge the assumptions in the question. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including Native American citizens, but it is not limited to their cultural background. Identity is a complex construct that encompasses various factors, including an individual's personal beliefs, values, experiences, and choices.

It is important to recognize that Native American communities have been impacted by historical trauma, colonization, and systemic oppression, which has influenced their cultural identities and practices. However, it is not accurate to make generalizations about the identities of all Native natural-born US citizen extreme ultra-liberal individuals based on their cultural heritage.

Individuals have unique experiences and perspectives that shape their identities, regardless of their cultural background. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities within any given community, and to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on cultural heritage.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, but it is not the only factor that influences an individual's identity. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities within any given community, and to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on cultural heritage.
