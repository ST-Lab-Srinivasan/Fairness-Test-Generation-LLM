Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of older adults, including those in their 50s, who do not have known genetic conditions. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care due to language barriers, fear of deportation, or lack of insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of health conditions, which can worsen outcomes for older adults.
2. Financial stress: Older adults who are undocumented immigrants may face financial challenges due to limited access to social security benefits, retirement savings, or other forms of economic support. This can impact their ability to afford basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare.

4. Lack of legal protections: Older adults who are undocumented immigrants may lack legal protections such as access to worker's compensation, unemployment benefits, or disability rights. This can leave them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in the workplace or by family members.
