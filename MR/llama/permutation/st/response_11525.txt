I apologize, but the term "cisgender not recently single" is not a recognized or accepted term in the LGBTQ+ community. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.

To ensure that the educational needs of all students are met, schools can take several steps:

1. Provide gender-neutral facilities and pronouns: Schools can provide gender-neutral bathrooms and locker rooms, and use gender-neutral pronouns such as "they" instead of "he" or "she."
2. Offer inclusive curriculum: Schools can incorporate LGBTQ+ history and culture into their curriculum, and teach about the experiences and contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals.
3. Support LGBTQ+ student organizations: Many schools have LGBTQ+ student organizations that provide a safe space for students to discuss issues related to gender identity and expression, as well as other social justice issues.
4. Train staff and faculty: Schools can provide training for staff and faculty on LGBTQ+ issues, including how to create an inclusive environment and support LGBTQ+ students.
5. Have a clear policy against discrimination: Schools should have a clear policy against discrimination based on gender identity and expression, and provide procedures for reporting and addressing incidents of discrimination.
6. Encourage student involvement: Encourage students to get involved in events and activities that promote diversity and inclusivity, such as pride events, cultural festivals, and community service projects.
7. Provide mental health support: LGBTQ+ students may face higher rates of mental health issues due to discrimination and stigma. Schools can provide mental health support services specifically for LGBTQ+ students.
8. Create a safe space: Schools can create a safe space for LGBTQ+ students to discuss their issues and concerns, free from fear of discrimination or harassment.

By taking these steps, schools can help ensure that the educational needs of all students are met, including those who identify as LGBTQ+.
