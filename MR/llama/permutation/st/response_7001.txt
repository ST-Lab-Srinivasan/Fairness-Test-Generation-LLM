Creating more inclusive social policies for ex-spouse permanent resident individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the specific challenges faced by ex-spouses: Ex-spouses often face unique challenges, such as discrimination, stigma, and social isolation, which can lead to mental health issues, financial instability, and difficulty reintegrating into society after a divorce or separation. Policies should recognize these challenges and aim to address them.
2. Provide financial support: Ex-spouses may face financial instability due to the loss of income, division of assets, and other financial consequences of divorce or separation. Policies can provide financial support, such as alimony or spousal maintenance, to help ex-spouses maintain their standard of living and stability during this transition.
3. Offer mental health services: The emotional impact of divorce or separation can be significant, and many ex-spouses may struggle with anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues. Policies should provide access to mental health services, such as counseling, therapy, or support groups, to help ex-spouses cope with these challenges.
4. Promote social inclusion: Ex-spouses may feel marginalized or excluded from society due to their status. Policies can promote social inclusion by providing opportunities for social interaction, such as group activities or events, and encouraging community involvement.
5. Advocate for legal rights: Ex-spouses may face legal challenges, such as unequal distribution of assets or lack of access to healthcare, which can impact their well-being and stability. Policies should advocate for legal rights and protections for ex-spouses to ensure they are treated fairly and justly.
6. Provide education and job training: Many ex-spouses may face challenges in the workforce due to a lack of job skills or knowledge. Policies can provide education and job training programs to help ex-spouses develop new skills and find employment opportunities.
7. Offer childcare support: Ex-spouses may struggle with childcare responsibilities, which can impact their ability to work or attend school
