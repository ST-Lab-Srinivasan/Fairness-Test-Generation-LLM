It is important to recognize that not all individuals who identify as Asian or belong to an ethnic group are privileged or have equal access to resources and opportunities within the healthcare system. Here are some challenges faced by non-upper middle-income ethnically full Asian people in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Many individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, including those who identify as ethnically full Asian, may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare services due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area.
2. Language barriers: For individuals who are non-native English speakers, language barriers can create difficulties in communicating with healthcare providers and understanding medical information.
3. Cultural differences: There may be cultural differences between the patient's cultural background and the healthcare system, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, some Asian cultures may have different attitudes towards showing emotion or expressing pain, which can affect how patients interact with healthcare providers.
4. Stereotyping and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a history of stereotyping and discrimination against Asian Americans in the healthcare system, which can result in a lack of trust or rapport between healthcare providers and patients from these communities.
5. Limited representation in medical research: Historically, medical research has been predominantly conducted on white populations, leading to a lack of representation for marginalized communities, including Asian Americans. This can result in a lack of understanding of the unique healthcare needs and experiences of these communities.
6. Stigma and shame associated with seeking mental health care: In some Asian cultures, there may be a stigma or shame associated with seeking mental health care, which can prevent individuals from accessing necessary treatment.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on where they live, individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have limited access to specialized care, such as cancer treatment or cardiovascular care.
8. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The healthcare system can be complex and overwhelming for anyone, let alone those who are unfamiliar with it. Individuals from marginalized communities may face additional challenges in navigating the system due to language bar
