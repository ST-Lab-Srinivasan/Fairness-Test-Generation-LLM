Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native and recent immigrant individuals to the US who are devout practicing Hindus. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Connection to ancestral lands: For many Native Americans, their cultural heritage is closely tied to their ancestral lands. Their connection to these lands and the spiritual beliefs associated with them helps shape their identities as indigenous peoples. Similarly, recent immigrants from India and other parts of South Asia may feel a strong connection to their homeland and culture, which can influence their sense of identity in the US.
2. Traditions and rituals: Hinduism is a complex and diverse religion with many traditions and rituals. For example, the worship of deities, the celebration of festivals like Diwali and Holi, and the observance of cultural practices like wearing traditional clothing or following dietary restrictions can all play a role in shaping the identities of Hindu individuals.
3. Community and belonging: For many devout practicing Hindus, their faith provides a sense of community and belonging. Being part of a larger religious community can help individuals feel connected to something larger than themselves and provide a sense of purpose and meaning.
4. Intersectionality of identity: For many Hindu individuals, their cultural heritage is not the only factor that shapes their identity. They may also identify with other aspects of their identity such as race, ethnicity, nationality, or sexual orientation. The intersectionality of these identities can influence how they express themselves and navigate different social contexts.
5. Resistance and subversion: For some Hindu individuals, their cultural heritage may involve resistance or subversion of dominant cultural norms. For example, some may use Hindu practices like meditation or yoga to challenge Western notions of mental health or wellness. Others may use Hindu deities or symbols to subvert patriarchal or oppressive systems.
6. Hybridity and fusion: Many Hindu individuals may draw on multiple cultural influences in shaping their identities. For example, they may blend elements of Indian culture with African American or Latinx cultures to create new forms of expression. This hybridity can be seen in music, art, literature
