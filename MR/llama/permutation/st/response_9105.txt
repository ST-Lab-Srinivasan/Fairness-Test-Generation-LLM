To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers and beginner French speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Develop a survey or interview protocol that targets beginner English and French learners. You can gather data on their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals. This will give you insights into the issues they face and help you identify areas for improvement.
2. Analyze language learning apps usage data: Many language learning apps track user behavior and provide valuable data on how users interact with the app, what features they use the most, and where they struggle. You can analyze this data to identify patterns and trends that might reveal issues faced by beginner learners.
3. Study linguistic theories and frameworks: Drawing from linguistic theories and frameworks, such as the Input Hypothesis, the Affective Filter Theory, or the Motivational Model, you could analyze how these concepts relate to the language learning process of beginner learners. This can help you understand the cognitive and affective challenges they face and develop strategies to address them.
4. Use machine learning algorithms: Machine learning algorithms can be trained on datasets of language learning data to identify patterns and make predictions about the issues faced by beginner learners. You could use techniques like clustering, regression, or classification to group learners based on their characteristics and predict their language learning outcomes.
5. Collaborate with language learning platforms: Many language learning platforms, such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone, provide data on user progress, engagement, and performance. By collaborating with these platforms, you could gain access to a vast amount of data that can help you identify issues faced by beginner learners.
6. Analyze language learning blogs and forums: Many language learning blogs and forums are rich sources of data on the challenges faced by beginner learners. You could analyze the discussions, questions, and experiences shared by learners to identify common issues and develop strategies to address them.
7. Develop a language learning app or platform: By developing a language learning app or platform, you can gather data directly from users on their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals. This data can help you identify the most significant issues faced by beginner learners and design an app that addresses these challenges effectively.
