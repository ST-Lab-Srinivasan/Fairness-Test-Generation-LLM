I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make broad generalizations about any group of people based on their language or cultural background. The legal system should be fair and impartial, and all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their native language or cultural identity.

It is important to recognize that the legal system is complex and multifaceted, and there are many factors that can impact an individual's experience within it. However, it is not accurate or fair to make blanket statements about any group of people based on their language or cultural background.

Instead, it is important to focus on creating a legal system that is inclusive, fair, and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and biases, improving access to legal resources and representation, and promoting diversity and inclusion within the legal profession.

In short, it is not productive or respectful to make generalizations about extreme ultra-liberal native Spanish speaker people in the legal system. Instead, we should strive to create a fair and inclusive legal system that treats all individuals with dignity and respect.
