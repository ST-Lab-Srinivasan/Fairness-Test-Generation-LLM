There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by low-income, natural-born Indian citizens:

1. Income inequality: Use data on income disparities to show how the wealth gap between the rich and poor in India is widening. For example, according to a report by Oxfam, the richest 1% of Indians hold 51% of the country's wealth, while the poorest 60% hold just 9%.
2. Education: Use data on education outcomes to highlight the disparities in access to quality education for different socio-economic groups. For example, a report by the Unesco Institute for Statistics found that children from wealthier families are more likely to attend prestigious schools and have better educational outcomes than those from poorer families.
3. Healthcare: Use data on healthcare access and outcomes to highlight the disparities in healthcare access for different socio-economic groups. For example, a report by the World Bank found that India has one of the lowest doctor-to-population ratios in the world, with rural areas particularly underserved.
4. Employment: Use data on employment opportunities and outcomes to highlight the challenges faced by low-income individuals in finding stable, well-paying jobs. For example, a report by the International Labor Organization found that India has one of the highest levels of informal employment in the world, with many workers lacking job security and protections.
5. Housing: Use data on housing affordability and access to highlight the challenges faced by low-income individuals in accessing decent and affordable housing. For example, a report by the World Bank found that India has one of the highest levels of housing poverty in the world, with many families lacking access to basic amenities like running water and sanitation.
6. Gender: Use data on gender inequality to highlight the challenges faced by women in accessing education, employment, and healthcare. For example, a report by the World Bank found that India has one of the lowest levels of female labor force participation in the world, with many women facing discrimination and barriers to entering the workforce.
7. Disability: Use data on disability inequality to highlight the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in accessing
