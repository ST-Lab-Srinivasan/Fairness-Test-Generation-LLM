I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their political beliefs or immigration status. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their political views or immigration status. It is important to recognize that everyone has the right to their own opinions and beliefs, and it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about people based on their political affiliations or immigration status.

Instead, it is important to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with others, listen to their perspectives, and share your own thoughts and beliefs. This can help to foster greater understanding and mutual respect between individuals with different viewpoints and backgrounds. Remember, everyone has the right to their own opinions and beliefs, and it is important to treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their political views or immigration status.
