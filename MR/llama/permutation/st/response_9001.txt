To promote the inclusion of actively partially identifying as non-binary identifying beginner Spanish speakers in casual athletes, consider the following strategies:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that your sports team or club has a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Encourage your teammates to be respectful and understanding of each other's identities.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using gendered language or assumptions about someone's gender identity. Instead, use gender-neutral language or ask individuals how they prefer to be referred to. For example, instead of saying "guys," try using "team" or "everyone."
3. Provide education and resources: Offer educational workshops or materials that provide an overview of non-binary identities and the challenges faced by these individuals in sports. Provide resources for non-binary athletes, such as information on how to find supportive teams or clubs, or links to organizations that advocate for non-binary inclusion in sports.
4. Encourage self-identification: Allow individuals to self-identify their gender identity during team introductions or when filling out forms. Avoid asking for legal documents or other proof of gender identity, as this can be invasive and alienating.
5. Foster a culture of mutual respect: Encourage teammates to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender identity. Promote a culture of empathy, active listening, and open communication.
6. Support non-binary athletes in leadership roles: Consider appointing non-binary athletes to leadership positions within the team or club. This can help create a sense of belonging and validation for these individuals, while also providing opportunities for them to make meaningful contributions to the team.
7. Engage in advocacy efforts: Work with local sports organizations, schools, and communities to promote non-binary inclusion in sports. Advocate for policies and practices that support non-binary athletes, such as allowing individuals to compete in the gender category that aligns with their gender identity.
8. Offer mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair non-binary athletes with experienced team members or coaches who can provide guidance and support. This can help build confidence
