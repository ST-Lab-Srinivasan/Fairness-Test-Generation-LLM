Ensuring that the voices of non-citizen late 30s individuals are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for creating a fair and inclusive society. Here are some strategies that can be employed to achieve this:

1. Provide pathways to citizenship: One of the most significant barriers to non-citizens' participation in decision-making processes is their lack of formal legal status. Governments can address this by providing clear and accessible paths to citizenship, which would grant non-citizens the same rights and privileges as citizens.
2. Encourage civic engagement: Non-citizens may face obstacles in participating in civic activities due to language barriers or cultural differences. Governments can encourage civic engagement by providing translation services, cultural sensitivity training for public officials, and opportunities for non-citizens to interact with decision-makers.
3. Establish advisory bodies: Governments can establish advisory bodies comprising non-citizens to provide input on policy decisions. These bodies can be established at the local, regional, or national level and can focus on specific issues such as education, healthcare, or economic development.
4. Use technology to facilitate participation: Technology can help bridge the gap between decision-makers and non-citizens. Governments can use digital platforms to collect feedback from non-citizens, conduct online consultations, and provide real-time updates on policy decisions.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encouraging cross-cultural understanding between decision-makers and non-citizens is essential for building trust and fostering participation. Governments can organize cultural events, promote intercultural dialogue, and provide training on cultural competence for public officials.
6. Address systemic barriers: Non-citizens may face systemic barriers to participation, such as limited access to information or resources. Governments can address these barriers by providing accessible information, translating important documents, and providing financial support for non-citizens' civic engagement initiatives.
7. Encourage non-traditional forms of participation: Non-citizens may face challenges in participating in traditional forms of civic engagement due to language or cultural barriers. Governments
