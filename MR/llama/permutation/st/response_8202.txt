The impact of military status on the lives of non-conservative individuals extends beyond those who are simply above the poverty line. Here are some additional ways in which military status can affect the lives of non-conservative individuals:

1. Social Stigma: Military service can carry a social stigma, particularly for those who serve in combat roles or engage in controversial missions. Non-conservative individuals may face discrimination or prejudice from their peers or society at large due to their military status.
2. Limited Employment Opportunities: Military service can limit employment opportunities for non-conservative individuals, particularly if they serve in roles that are seen as controversial or unpopular. Veterans may face discrimination or bias when seeking civilian employment, or they may find it difficult to transition into a career that aligns with their skills and interests.
3. Mental Health Impacts: Military service can have significant mental health impacts on non-conservative individuals, particularly if they experience trauma or are exposed to combat situations. These impacts can include anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other conditions that may affect their ability to function in civilian life.
4. Lack of Autonomy: Military service can limit an individual's autonomy and freedom of expression, particularly if they serve in roles that are subject to strict rules and regulations. Non-conservative individuals may feel stifled or constrained by the military's hierarchy and chain of command.
5. Internal Conflict: Military service can create internal conflict for non-conservative individuals who may struggle with their personal values and beliefs aligning with those of the military. This can lead to feelings of disillusionment, betrayal, or confusion about one's identity and purpose.
6. Limited Access to Resources: Military service can limit an individual's access to resources such as education, healthcare, and financial support. Non-conservative individuals may find it difficult to access these resources due to their military status or the stigma associated with it.
7. Social Isolation: Military service can lead to social isolation for non-conservative individuals, particularly if they serve in remote or isolated locations. This can affect their ability to maintain relationships and connections
