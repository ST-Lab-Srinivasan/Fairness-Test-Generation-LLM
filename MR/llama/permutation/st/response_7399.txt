As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "natural-born Indian citizens" is not a legally recognized term in India. Indian citizenship is determined by the Constitution of India and other laws, and is based on a person's place of birth, ancestry, or residence.

However, if you are asking about the challenges faced by Indian citizens seeking employment in the legal system, there are several issues that they may encounter. These include:

1. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin is still prevalent in many parts of India. Indian citizens from marginalized communities may face discrimination in the job market, including being passed over for promotions or being denied opportunities.
2. Lack of representation: The legal system in India has historically been dominated by upper-caste Hindus, leaving limited opportunities for representation and advancement for marginalized communities. This can make it difficult for Indian citizens from these communities to find employment in the legal field.
3. Limited access to education and resources: Many Indian citizens, especially those from marginalized communities, may have limited access to quality education and resources, which can make it difficult for them to compete with their more privileged counterparts in the job market.
4. Gender bias: Women in India still face significant gender bias in the workplace, including lower pay and fewer opportunities for advancement. This can be particularly challenging for women from marginalized communities who may already face additional barriers to employment.
5. Language barriers: For Indian citizens who are not proficient in the dominant languages of India (such as Hindi or English), there may be language barriers that limit their ability to access job opportunities and advance in their careers.
6. Lack of mentorship and networking opportunities: Without access to mentorship and networking opportunities, Indian citizens from marginalized communities may find it difficult to connect with potential employers and build relationships that can lead to job opportunities.
7. Stereotyping and bias: Indian citizens from marginalized communities may face stereotyping and bias based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin, which can limit their job opportunities and create a hostile work environment.
