Creating more inclusive cultural programs for strong atheists who are not deep in poverty requires understanding and addressing the unique needs and challenges of this group. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Acknowledge and validate their experiences: Strong atheists may face discrimination or marginalization due to their beliefs, particularly in religious or spiritual communities. By acknowledging and validating their experiences, cultural programs can help create a more inclusive environment.
2. Provide opportunities for intellectual engagement: Strong atheists are often interested in intellectual pursuits and may be looking for cultural programs that challenge them intellectually. Consider offering lectures, debates, or workshops on topics related to science, philosophy, or critical thinking.
3. Foster a sense of community: While some strong atheists may prefer to keep their beliefs private, others may benefit from connecting with like-minded individuals. Cultural programs can provide opportunities for socializing and building relationships with others who share similar beliefs and values.
4. Offer practical support: Strong atheists may face practical challenges related to their beliefs, such as finding employment or accessing healthcare. Consider offering resources or support to help them navigate these challenges.
5. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of different belief systems. Avoid using language that is loaded with religious connotations or assumes a particular worldview.
6. Be aware of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential for power imbalances within cultural programs, particularly if they are focused on intellectual or philosophical discussions. Consider ways to empower and amplify the voices of marginalized individuals, such as through peer-led initiatives or co-facilitation.
7. Provide safe spaces: Create safe spaces for strong atheists to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can involve creating physical spaces that are free from religious imagery or symbolism, or organizing events that are specifically designed to be inclusive and welcoming.
8. Engage in advocacy and activism: Strong atheists may be interested in advocating for their rights and challenging discriminatory practices. Consider partnering with them on advocacy initiatives or supporting their efforts through community organizing or media campaigns.
