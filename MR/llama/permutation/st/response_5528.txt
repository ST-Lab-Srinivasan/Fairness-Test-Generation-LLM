Creating more inclusive social policies for upper-upper middle-income actively partially identifying as non-binary individuals requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the existence of non-binary identity: The first step is to acknowledge and recognize the existence of non-binary identity, which is often overlooked or ignored in societal policies. Non-binary individuals face discrimination and marginalization, which can lead to higher rates of mental health issues, substance abuse, and suicide.
2. Conduct a comprehensive survey: Conduct a comprehensive survey to gather data on the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals in different regions and communities. This will help identify the specific needs and challenges of this group and inform policy development.
3. Involve non-binary individuals in policy-making: Engage actively partially identifying as non-binary individuals in the policy-making process to ensure that their voices are heard and their perspectives are taken into account. This can be done through consultations, focus groups, or other participatory methods.
4. Develop inclusive policies: Develop policies that address the specific needs of non-binary individuals, such as access to healthcare, education, employment, and social protection. Ensure that these policies are inclusive and do not perpetuate discrimination or marginalization.
5. Provide access to gender-affirming care: Ensure that non-binary individuals have access to gender-affirming care, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and gender-affirming surgeries. This can help improve mental health outcomes and overall well-being.
6. Address legal barriers: Address legal barriers that prevent non-binary individuals from fully exercising their rights. For example, many countries still have laws that require individuals to identify as male or female on official documents, such as passports and driver's licenses.
7. Promote inclusive language and culture: Promote inclusive language and culture by using gender-neutral pronouns and terminology, and avoiding assumptions about an individual's gender identity. This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce discrimination.
8. Support mental health services
