Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Independent Elderly Male People

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of individuals, regardless of age. However, among independent elderly male people, cultural heritage assumes even greater importance. This study aims to investigate the role that cultural heritage plays in the lives of independent elderly male people and how it influences their identity, sense of belonging, and overall well-being.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage has a profound impact on the lives of individuals, particularly during old age. Elderly individuals often rely on their cultural heritage for a sense of continuity and stability, as it provides them with a connection to their past, present, and future (Haviland, 2013). Cultural heritage also serves as a source of identity and belonging, helping elderly individuals maintain their sense of self and community (Komaki & Kravitz, 2014).

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with independent elderly male people. Participants were selected through purposive sampling, ensuring that the sample was diverse in terms of age, geographic location, and cultural background. The interviews were conducted in a comfortable and familiar setting, allowing participants to share their experiences and thoughts freely.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that cultural heritage plays a vital role in the lives of independent elderly male people. Participants reported that cultural heritage provided them with a sense of identity, purpose, and belonging. They felt connected to their community and their ancestors through shared cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the significant role that cultural heritage plays in the lives of independent elderly male people. Cultural heritage provides these individuals with a sense of continuity, identity, and belonging, which is particularly important during old age. Healthcare providers, policymakers, and community leaders can use these findings to develop programs and policies that promote and preserve cultural heritage among elderly populations. By doing so, they can help ensure the well-being and quality of life of independent elderly male people.
