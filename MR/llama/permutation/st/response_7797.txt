Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of Nigerian native recent immigrants to the United States. It provides a sense of identity, belonging, and connection to their ancestors and community. Here are some ways cultural heritage impacts the lives of these immigrants:

1. Sense of Identity: Cultural heritage helps Nigerian immigrants maintain their sense of identity and belonging in a new country. It provides them with a sense of roots and history, which is essential for emotional well-being and psychological stability in a foreign land.
2. Preservation of Traditions: Cultural heritage acts as a bridge between the past and the present, allowing Nigerian immigrants to preserve their cultural traditions and practices in the US. This helps them maintain their cultural identity and avoid cultural assimilation.
3. Community Building: Cultural heritage serves as a unifying factor for Nigerian immigrant communities in the US. It provides a common framework for social interaction, cultural expression, and community building.
4. Preservation of Language: Many Nigerian immigrants in the US speak their indigenous languages, which helps preserve their cultural heritage. This language preservation also enables them to maintain their cultural identity and connect with their ancestors.
5. Connection to Ancestors: Cultural heritage provides Nigerian immigrants with a connection to their ancestors and the land of their origin. It helps them stay grounded in their cultural beliefs, values, and practices, even as they adapt to their new environment.
6. Coping Mechanism: In times of stress or adversity, cultural heritage can serve as a coping mechanism for Nigerian immigrants. It provides a sense of comfort, familiarity, and security in an unfamiliar environment.
7. Economic Empowerment: Cultural heritage can also play a role in the economic empowerment of Nigerian immigrants. By preserving and promoting their cultural traditions, they can create new business opportunities and entrepreneurial ventures that reflect their cultural identity.
