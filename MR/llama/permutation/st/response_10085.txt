Protecting the legal rights of newly married active-duty individuals can be challenging due to the unique circumstances of military service. Here are some measures that can be taken to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Understand the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ): The UCMJ is the legal framework that governs the military. It's essential for newly married couples to understand the laws and regulations that apply to them, particularly those related to marriage, deployment, and benefits.
2. Review Military Benefits: Active-duty service members are entitled to various benefits, including healthcare, housing, and education assistance. Newly married couples should review these benefits and understand how they can help protect their legal rights.
3. Develop a Deployment Plan: Deployment can be challenging for newly married couples. Developing a deployment plan that includes communication strategies, financial planning, and emotional support can help ensure that the couple's legal rights are protected during deployments.
4. Consider Estate Planning: Active-duty service members should consider estate planning to protect their legal rights and provide for their spouse in case of incapacitation or death. This may include creating a will, designating beneficiaries, and setting up trusts.
5. Seek Legal Advice: Consulting with a military lawyer or legal expert can help newly married couples understand their legal rights and protections. They can provide guidance on how to navigate the legal system and protect their interests.
6. Utilize Military Resources: The military offers various resources to support newly married couples, including counseling services, financial planning workshops, and legal assistance. Taking advantage of these resources can help protect the couple's legal rights and well-being.
7. Stay Informed: Keeping informed about changes in military policies and regulations can help newly married couples protect their legal rights. This may include staying up to date on benefits, entitlements, and other legal matters that affect active-duty service members.
8. Build a Support Network: Building a support network of friends, family, and fellow military spouses can provide emotional and practical support during the challenges of military life. This network can also help newly married couples navigate legal issues and protect their rights.
