Non-liberal immigrant recent immigrants to the US face several challenges in accessing and navigating the US healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many non-liberal immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can make it difficult for them to communicate with healthcare providers, navigate medical forms and procedures, and understand their treatment options.
2. Cultural differences: Immigrants may come from different cultural backgrounds and have different expectations about healthcare.

Healthcare providers may need to be sensitive to these cultural differences and adapt their approach accordingly.
3. Lack of insurance: Many non-liberal immigrants may not have access to health insurance, either because they are undocumented or because they cannot afford it. This can make it difficult for them to receive medical care, including preventive services like check-ups and screenings.
4. Limited access to specialized care: Non-liberal immigrants may face barriers to accessing specialized care, such as cardiologists or oncologists, due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about available resources.
