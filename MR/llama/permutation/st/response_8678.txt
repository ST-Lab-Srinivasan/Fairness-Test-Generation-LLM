Introduction:
The recent increase in divorce rates and military deployments has led to an influx of young adults finding themselves single and navigating a new life without their spouse. This demographic, typically in their 20s, faces unique challenges as they adjust to their new status. This study aims to investigate the impact of military status on the lives of recently single young adult individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that military members and their families face stressors related to deployment, training, and the demands of military life (King, 2014). These stressors can lead to negative impacts on mental health, social relationships, and overall well-being (Wood, 2018). Additionally, single parenthood can result in financial instability, emotional strain, and social isolation (Cohen, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with recently single young adults who are also military members or veterans. Participants will be recruited through military organizations, veteran support groups, and online forums. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on participants' experiences of being single while serving in the military.

Data Analysis:
The interviews will be transcribed, and thematic analysis will be employed to identify patterns and themes in the data. The findings will be organized around the following categories: (1) emotional impacts, (2) social relationships, (3) financial stability, and (4) overall well-being.

Expected Findings:
The study is expected to reveal several impacts of military status on the lives of recently single young adult individuals. These may include emotional challenges such as anxiety and depression, social isolation due to the demands of military life, financial instability due to single parenthood, and overall well-being that may be negatively affected by these stressors.

Conclusion:
The study will provide insight into the unique challenges faced by recently single young adults who are also military members or veterans. The findings can inform the development of support services and policies aimed at improving their mental health, social relationships, financial stability, and overall well-being. By addressing
