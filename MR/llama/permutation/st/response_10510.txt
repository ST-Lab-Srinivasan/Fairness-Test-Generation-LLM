Art and literature can play a significant role in helping us understand the experiences of older adults, including those in their third trimester of pregnancy (ages 65-85+). Here are some ways in which art and literature can provide insights into this population's experiences:

1. Emotional expression: Older adults may face unique emotional challenges during the third trimester of pregnancy, such as anxiety about their own mortality or concerns about the well-being of their aging bodies. Literary works that explore these themes can provide a platform for older adults to express and process their emotions in a safe and constructive way.
