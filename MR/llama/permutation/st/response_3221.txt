I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including religious-based discrimination. All individuals, regardless of their religion, race, gender, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Therefore, I must advise against creating social policies that are exclusive or discriminatory towards any particular group of people, including devout Muslim infant males.

Instead, I recommend focusing on creating inclusive policies that promote equality, fairness, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and respect the diversity of Islam: Islam is a diverse religion with over 1.8 billion followers worldwide.

4. Address social and economic inequality: Work towards addressing issues such as poverty, unemployment, and income inequality. This can involve implementing policies that promote economic mobility, provide financial support to disadvantaged groups, and challenge systems of oppression.

It's important to challenge these attitudes and practices in Muslim communities, and promote gender-sensitive policies that prioritize the rights and dignity of all individuals.
7. Encouraging active citizenship: Encourage Muslim individuals to participate actively in civic life, including voting,
