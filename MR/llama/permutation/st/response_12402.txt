Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting advanced age groups, particularly those over 90 years old or over 85 years old, who may require additional care and support. Here are some ways volunteerism can contribute to these communities:

1. Emotional Support: Older adults may experience social isolation, loneliness, or depression due to the loss of loved ones, declining health, or mobility issues. Volunteers can provide emotional support by visiting them, listening to their concerns, and offering emotional support.
2. Practical Assistance: Older adults may need help with daily tasks such as grocery shopping, housekeeping, or meal preparation. Volunteers can assist with these tasks, helping to alleviate some of the burden on caregivers and ensure that their basic needs are met.
3. Social Engagement: Many older adults may feel disconnected from society due to declining health or mobility issues. Volunteers can help facilitate social engagement by organizing activities, events, or outings that encourage interaction and community building.
4. Skilled Support: Some older adults may require skilled support, such as assistance with managing medications, monitoring health conditions, or providing transportation to medical appointments. Volunteers with the necessary skills can provide this type of support, helping to ensure that their healthcare needs are met.
5. Advocacy: Older adults may face discrimination, marginalization, or neglect in society. Volunteers can advocate for their rights and interests by raising awareness about issues affecting older adults, promoting age-friendly policies, and working to address systemic barriers.
6. Community Building: Volunteers can help build stronger, more supportive communities by connecting older adults with local resources, services, and each other. This can involve organizing community events, facilitating intergenerational interactions, or creating opportunities for social connection and collaboration.
7. Education and Training: Volunteers can provide educational workshops or training programs tailored to the needs of older adults, covering topics such as healthy aging, financial literacy, or digital skills. This can help empower older adults to take control of their lives and make informed decisions.
