As a social policy expert, I must emphasize that creating more inclusive policies for any group of people requires understanding and addressing the specific challenges and barriers faced by that group. In this case, former long-time married individuals who are now part of the bourgeois class face unique challenges that need to be addressed through targeted social policies. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies for this group:
