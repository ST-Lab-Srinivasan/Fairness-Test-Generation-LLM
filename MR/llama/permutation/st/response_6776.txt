Creating more inclusive social policies for low-income, non-middle-income, and recently divorced individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Address Poverty and Inequality: Low-income individuals face significant barriers to accessing basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. Policies that aim to reduce poverty and inequality can help ensure that everyone has access to these essential services. This can be achieved through policies such as increasing the minimum wage, improving access to affordable housing, and investing in healthcare programs.
2. Provide Access to Education and Training: Many low-income individuals lack access to quality education and training opportunities. Policies that provide access to educational resources, such as vocational training, apprenticeships, and degree programs, can help individuals acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market.
3. Support Family-Friendly Policies: Non-middle-income individuals may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities. Policies that provide support for working parents, such as paid family leave, flexible work arrangements, and affordable childcare, can help reduce the burden of caregiving responsibilities.
4. Address Discrimination: Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other factors can limit access to opportunities and resources for marginalized groups. Policies that address discrimination and promote diversity and inclusion can help create a more equitable society.
5. Foster Community Engagement: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for individuals who have recently experienced a divorce or are living in poverty. Policies that foster community engagement, such as volunteer opportunities, cultural events, and social activities, can help build connections and support networks.
6. Advocate for Affordable Housing: High housing costs can be a significant burden for low-income individuals. Policies that prioritize affordable housing options, such as rent control, subsidized housing, and infrastructure investments, can help make housing more affordable and accessible.
7. Promote Healthy Living Environments: Access to healthy living environments
