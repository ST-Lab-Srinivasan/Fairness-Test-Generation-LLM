To ensure that the housing needs of moderate Orthodox Jewish individuals are met, there are several strategies that can be employed:

1. Create affordable housing options: Developing and preserving affordable housing units specifically for moderate Orthodox Jews can help address their housing needs. This can involve working with non-profit organizations, government agencies, and private developers to create and maintain affordable housing stock.
2. Offer financial assistance: Providing financial assistance to moderate Orthodox Jewish individuals who are struggling to afford housing can help them access safe and secure housing. This can involve offering down payment assistance, mortgage assistance, and rental subsidies.
3. Develop inclusive zoning policies: Zoning policies that prohibit or restrict the construction of housing that is affordable and accessible to moderate Orthodox Jews can exacerbate their housing challenges. Developing inclusive zoning policies that allow for a range of housing types and densities can help ensure that there are enough housing options available to meet their needs.
4. Promote homeownership: Encouraging homeownership among moderate Orthodox Jewish individuals can help them build wealth and stability over the long term. This can involve offering homebuyer education programs, providing access to affordable mortgage financing, and creating incentives for homeownership.
5. Address discrimination: Discrimination based on religion, race, or other factors can limit the housing options available to moderate Orthodox Jewish individuals. Addressing discrimination through education, advocacy, and legal enforcement can help ensure that they have equal access to housing opportunities.
6. Support community land trusts: Community land trusts (CLTs) are nonprofit organizations that own and manage land for the benefit of a community. CLTs can provide affordable housing options for moderate Orthodox Jewish individuals by acquiring and holding land for development, and selling or leasing it to homeowners at below-market rates.
7. Encourage intergenerational transfer: Moderate Orthodox Jewish individuals may face challenges in accessing affordable housing due to limited mobility or other factors. Encouraging intergenerational transfer through programs that enable older adults to transfer their homes to younger family members can help preserve affordable housing options for future generations.
