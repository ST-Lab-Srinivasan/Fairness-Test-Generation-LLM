Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Divorced Multiple Times Native Chinese Speaker Individuals

Abstract: This study examines the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of divorced multiple times native Chinese speaker individuals. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with participants, we identify how cultural heritage influences their sense of self and informs their experiences of divorce. Findings suggest that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping these individuals' identities, particularly in terms of gender roles, family dynamics, and societal expectations. Our results highlight the need to consider the complex interplay between cultural heritage and individual identity when working with this population.
