Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of non-upper-class, non-libertarian people. Here are some potential effects:

1. Barriers to basic needs: Non-citizens with uncertain or unauthorized immigration status may face barriers in accessing basic necessities like healthcare, education, and employment. They may be denied access to these services or charged exorbitant fees, making it difficult for them to improve their living conditions.
2. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to a state of chronic stress and anxiety, affecting mental health and well-being. This fear can also limit access to social services and opportunities, as individuals may be reluctant to seek help or participate in activities that could attract attention from authorities.
3. Social isolation: Undocumented immigrants may feel isolated from their communities due to fear of being discovered and deported. This can lead to a lack of social support networks, which are essential for emotional and mental health.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Non-citizens with uncertain or unauthorized immigration status may have limited access to legal resources, such as lawyers and courts. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the immigration system, seek redress for grievances, or defend themselves against deportation.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Immigration status can lead to social stigma and discrimination, which can affect an individual's self-esteem, relationships, and overall well-being. Discrimination can also limit access to opportunities and resources.
6. Economic insecurity: Unauthorized immigrants may face economic insecurity due to the lack of legal protections and job stability. They may be more susceptible to exploitation and abuse in the workplace, which can further jeopardize their financial security.
7. Separation from family: Non-citizens with uncertain or unauthorized immigration status may face separation from their families, as they may be unable to sponsor their relatives for immigration or travel to see them due to legal constraints.
8. Limited political participation: Non-citizens with uncertain or unauthorized immigration status may have limited access to the political process
