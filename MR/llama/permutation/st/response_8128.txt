Regarding the challenges faced by immigrant natural-born US citizens in the healthcare system, there are several issues that they may encounter. These include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Immigrants, including those who are natural-born US citizens, may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to language barriers, lack of health insurance, or fear of deportation.
2. Discrimination: Immigrants may experience discrimination in the healthcare system based on their immigration status, leading to poorer quality care or delayed treatment.
3. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of immigrant communities, leading to miscommunication or mishandling of medical situations.
4. Lack of trust: Immigrants may lack trust in the healthcare system due to past experiences of discrimination or marginalization, which can lead to delayed or avoided medical care.
5. Language barriers: Immigrants who do not speak English fluently may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
6. Financial barriers: Many immigrants may struggle to afford healthcare services due to limited financial resources, which can lead to delayed or avoided medical care.
7. Lack of access to specialized care: Immigrants may have difficulty accessing specialized medical care, such as mental health services or complex surgeries, due to language barriers or lack of familiarity with the healthcare system.
8. Stigma and shame: Immigrants may experience stigma or shame associated with seeking medical care, particularly if they are undocumented or have a history of marginalization.
9. Limited access to preventive care: Immigrants may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups or vaccinations, due to language barriers or lack of familiarity with the healthcare system.
