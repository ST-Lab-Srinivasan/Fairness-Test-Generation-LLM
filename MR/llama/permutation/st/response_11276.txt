As a beginner Arabic speaker immigrant natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: The biggest challenge for many immigrants is the language barrier. Arabic is a complex language with many nuances and idioms that can be difficult to understand, especially when it comes to legal terminology. This can make it hard to navigate the legal system and communicate effectively with legal professionals.
2. Lack of Cultural Awareness: The legal system in the US is based on Anglo-American common law, which may be unfamiliar to many immigrants from non-Western cultures. Understanding cultural norms and customs can help you navigate the legal system more effectively.
3. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Many immigrants face limited access to legal resources, including lawyers, legal aid organizations, and government agencies. This can make it difficult to get the help they need to navigate the legal system.
4. Discrimination and Bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against immigrants, particularly those from Muslim-majority countries, is still prevalent in the US legal system. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of trust in the legal system.
5. Difficulty with Legal Terminology: Arabic speakers may struggle to understand legal terminology, such as contracts, wills, and other legal documents. This can make it difficult to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
6. Limited Knowledge of US Laws and Regulations: Many immigrants are not familiar with US laws and regulations, which can make it difficult to understand how they apply to their specific situations.
7. Difficulty with the Court System: The court system in the US can be complex and intimidating, particularly for those who are not fluent in English. This can make it hard for immigrants to navigate the legal system and advocate for themselves in court.
8. Lack of Trust in the Legal System: Many immigrants may lack trust in the legal system due to past experiences of discrimination or unequal treatment under the law. This can make it difficult to seek legal help or navigate the system effectively.
9. Limited Access to Financial Resources
