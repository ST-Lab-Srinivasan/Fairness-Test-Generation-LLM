Creating more inclusive cultural events for recently pregnant individuals, including those who are bisexual, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies that event organizers can use to make their events more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is accessible for all participants, including those with mobility issues or other disabilities. Provide clear signage, accessible restrooms, and adequate seating options.
2. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as reserved seating, wheelchair-accessible areas, and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all promotional materials, including flyers, posters, and social media posts. Avoid using language that may be offensive or alienating to marginalized groups.
4. Gender-neutral bathrooms: Provide gender-neutral bathrooms or make sure there are enough single-stall bathrooms for attendees who may need them.
5. Pregnancy and disability accommodations: Offer accommodations for pregnant individuals, such as reserved seating or areas where they can rest during the event. Be aware of the needs of attendees with disabilities and work to provide equal access to all.
6. Diverse representation: Ensure that the event features diverse speakers, performers, and artists. Representation matters, and attendees should be able to see themselves reflected in the content presented.
7. Inclusive programming: Plan programming that caters to a variety of interests and needs. Offer workshops or sessions on topics such as parenting, self-care, and mental health, which can be particularly important for marginalized communities.
8. Safe space policy: Establish a safe space policy that provides a welcoming environment for all attendees. Make sure that event staff are trained to handle any incidents or conflicts that may arise.
9. Accessibility during COVID-19 pandemic: During the pandemic, it's important to prioritize safety and accessibility. Provide masks, sanitizer stations, and follow social distancing guidelines to ensure a safe event for all attendees.
