As a career coach, I understand that supporting the career aspirations of expectant mothers in their upper upper middle-income bracket can be challenging, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Understand their priorities: It's essential to understand the priorities and concerns of these individuals. They may have career goals they want to achieve before having a baby, or they may be concerned about how their pregnancy will affect their professional life. Listen carefully to their needs and provide tailored advice.
2. Focus on flexibility: Upper middle-income expectant mothers often have busy schedules and multiple responsibilities. Offer flexible career coaching options, such as virtual sessions or flexible scheduling, to accommodate their needs.
3. Encourage networking: Encourage expectant mothers to network with other professionals in their industry, even during the third trimester. This can help them stay connected and informed about new opportunities and trends in their field.
