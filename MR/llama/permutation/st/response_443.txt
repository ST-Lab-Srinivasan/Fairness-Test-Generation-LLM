Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Arabic speakers from lower-class backgrounds requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Language support: Provide language support during the event by offering translation services or providing written materials in both Arabic and the local language. This will help bridge the language barrier and make it easier for participants to understand and engage with the content.
2. Accessible venue: Choose a venue that is easily accessible for people from lower-class backgrounds. Consider the location, transportation options, and amenities such as parking, seating, and lighting. Make sure the venue is wheelchair-friendly and has adequate space for participants to move around comfortably.
3. Affordable registration fees: Offer affordable registration fees or provide financial aid options to make the event more accessible to people from lower-class backgrounds. This can include scholarships, grants, or sliding scale fees based on income level.
4. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive marketing strategies to promote the event and reach a diverse audience. This can include using visual and audio materials that reflect the local culture and language, as well as targeted outreach to marginalized communities.
5. Interpretation and translation services: Provide interpretation and translation services during the event to ensure that participants can understand and engage with the content. This can include providing headsets or earpieces for participants who need them.
6. Childcare and family-friendly activities: Offer childcare and family-friendly activities to make the event more accessible to parents and caregivers. This can include providing a separate space for children, offering kid-friendly activities, or providing childcare services during the event.
7. Inclusive programming: Create an inclusive program that reflects the diverse backgrounds and experiences of participants. This can include offering workshops on topics relevant to lower-class communities, such as financial literacy, health and wellness, and community organizing.
8. Food and refreshments: Provide food and refreshments that are culturally appropriate and accessible to people from lower-class backgrounds. Consider offering vegetarian or vegan options, as well as gluten-free and halal foods
