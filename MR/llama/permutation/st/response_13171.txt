Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Spanish speakers who are also of African descent requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen to the community: Engage with members of the community to understand their needs, preferences, and cultural practices. This will help you design programs that are relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning and implementation of cultural programs involve a diversity of voices and viewpoints. This can be achieved by including community members in the decision-making process, as well as working with cultural experts from different backgrounds.
3. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Create opportunities for people from different cultural backgrounds to learn about each other's traditions, customs, and beliefs. This can help build bridges of understanding and respect between communities.
4. Provide language support: For Native Spanish speakers who may not be fluent in English, provide language support and interpretation services during cultural programs. This will ensure that everyone can fully participate and enjoy the programs.
5. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that have affected different communities, and work to address these power imbalances in your programming.

6. Create intergenerational opportunities: Involve older community members in mentorship roles, sharing their cultural knowledge and experiences with younger generations. This can help preserve cultural traditions and pass them down to future generations.

8. Provide access to cultural resources: Offer access to cultural artifacts, literature, and other resources that reflect the experiences and traditions of Native Spanish speakers. This can help deepen their understanding and appreciation of their cultural heritage.
9. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected. Encourage community members to share their stories, traditions, and practices with
