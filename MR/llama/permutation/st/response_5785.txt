Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of wedded beginner English speaker individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. For English speakers who are newlywed or beginners, their cultural heritage can influence their understanding of marriage, relationships, and family dynamics.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of wedded beginner English speaker individuals:

1. Expectations and Roles: The cultural heritage of a person can shape their expectations and roles within a marriage.

2. Communication Styles: Cultural heritage can also influence how individuals communicate with each other within a marriage. For instance, some cultures value direct communication, while others prefer indirect communication. Beginner English speakers may find themselves adjusting their communication styles to better connect with their spouse and avoid misunderstandings.
