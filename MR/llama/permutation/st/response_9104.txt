To use data to highlight the issues faced by native English speaker beginner Spanish speaker individuals, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Analyze language learning data: Collect and analyze data on the language learning process of native English speakers who are learning Spanish. This could include data on their proficiency levels, language learning strategies, and challenges faced during the learning process.
2. Conduct surveys or interviews: Surveys or interviews can provide valuable insights into the experiences and challenges faced by native English speaker beginner Spanish speakers. You could ask questions related to their motivation for learning Spanish, their exposure to the language, and any challenges they face in terms of pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary.
3. Use existing data: Utilize existing data on language learning and cognition to better understand the issues faced by native English speaker beginner Spanish speakers. For example, you could analyze data from studies on language acquisition, bilingualism, and executive functions to identify how these factors may impact the learning process.
4. Create a corpus of learner data: Collect and analyze data from a large number of learners to create a corpus of learner data. This could include data on their language use, learning strategies, and performance in language tasks. By analyzing this data, you can identify patterns and trends that may be useful for understanding the issues faced by native English speaker beginner Spanish speakers.
5. Use machine learning algorithms: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze large datasets of learner language data and identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent through manual analysis. For example, you could use a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify learners based on their proficiency levels or to predict their future progress in the language.
6. Create a database of learner language data: Collect and store learner language data in a database, which can be used for further analysis and comparison across different learners and groups. This could include data on their language use, learning strategies, and performance in language tasks.
7. Use eye-tracking technology: Eye-tracking technology can provide insights into how learners attend to and process linguistic input. By analyzing eye movements, you can identify which aspects of the language are most challenging for learners and where they may be struggling.
