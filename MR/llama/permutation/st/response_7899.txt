Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal beginner English speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide multilingual signage and communication: Use signs, brochures, and other materials in multiple languages to ensure that everyone can access information. This can include braille for individuals who are visually impaired or have difficulty reading printed material.
2. Offer interpreters or translation services: Provide interpreters or translation services during events or meetings to enable non-English speakers to participate fully.
3. Design accessible spaces: Ensure that public spaces are physically accessible to people of all abilities. This can include ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
4. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is offensive or exclusive to any group. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.
5. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion by promoting diversity and respect for differences. This can involve training staff and volunteers on cultural competence and providing opportunities for non-English speakers to contribute to decision-making processes.
6. Provide bilingual or multilingual staff support: Hire staff or provide volunteers who are fluent in the languages spoken by the community you are serving. This can help ensure that non-English speakers receive adequate support and can navigate services with ease.
7. Use technology to facilitate communication: Utilize technology, such as translation apps or video conferencing tools, to facilitate communication between English speakers and non-English speakers.
8. Create opportunities for socialization: Provide opportunities for non-English speakers to socialize and connect with other members of the community. This can help build relationships and promote a sense of belonging.
9. Offer language classes or resources: Provide language classes or resources for non-English speakers to learn English and improve their communication skills.
10. Evaluate and adjust: Continuously evaluate the inclusivity of public spaces and make adjustments as needed based on feedback from non-English speakers. This can involve soliciting input from community members and making changes to policies, procedures, and practices to better serve non-English speakers.
