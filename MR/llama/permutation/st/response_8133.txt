Non-libertarian immigrants to the US often face significant challenges when navigating the country's complex healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Language barriers: Many non-libertarian immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can create communication difficulties when trying to access healthcare services. They may struggle to understand medical terminology, fill out forms, or communicate their symptoms to healthcare providers.
2. Cultural differences: Healthcare systems in other countries may have different cultural norms and practices than what non-libertarian immigrants are used to. For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on traditional medicine or use different methods of pain management. These differences can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications when interacting with healthcare providers.
3. Limited access to care: Non-libertarian immigrants may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be undocumented, have a pending asylum application, or be in the process of obtaining a green card. These individuals may avoid seeking medical attention out of fear of being deported or facing legal consequences.
4. High costs: Healthcare in the US can be expensive, and non-libertarian immigrants may struggle to afford it. They may have limited financial resources or lack access to health insurance, which can make it difficult to pay for medical services.
5. Discrimination: Non-libertarian immigrants may experience discrimination when seeking healthcare services. They may face language barriers, cultural differences, and biases from healthcare providers. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and difficulty accessing appropriate care.

They may struggle to understand how to access care, fill out forms, or navigate the billing and insurance processes.
7. Limited knowledge of available resources: Non-libertarian immigrants may be unaware of the resources available to them, such as community clinics or free or low-cost healthcare services. They may also be unsure
