Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizen non-upper-class people are met is crucial for promoting equity and reducing health disparities in India. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Improve access to healthcare: Many non-upper-class people in India face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to lack of financial resources, transportation, or geographical location. Governments and NGOs can work towards establishing more affordable healthcare facilities, improving transportation infrastructure, and providing telemedicine services to remote areas.
2. Strengthen primary healthcare: Primary healthcare is the foundation of a robust healthcare system. India needs to invest in building a network of well-equipped primary healthcare centers, staffed by trained healthworkers, to provide preventive and curative care to non-upper-class people.
3. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants like poverty, education, housing, and sanitation have a significant impact on health outcomes. Policies aimed at reducing poverty, improving access to education, providing affordable housing, and ensuring proper sanitation can help improve the overall health of non-upper-class people.
4. Increase public investment in health: India needs to prioritize public investment in healthcare, particularly in rural areas where access to quality healthcare is limited. This can be achieved by increasing the allocation of the union and state governments towards healthcare infrastructure, staffing, and services.
5. Promote community participation: Community participation can help identify local health needs and priorities, and involve non-upper-class people in decision-making processes related to healthcare. This can lead to more responsive and culturally appropriate healthcare services.
6. Foster public-private partnerships: Collaboration between government, private sector, and civil society organizations can help leverage resources, expertise, and reach to improve access to quality healthcare for non-upper-class people.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Advocacy efforts can be made to push for policies that prioritize the healthcare needs of non-upper-class people, such as increasing government spending on health, promoting universal health coverage, and addressing the social determinants
