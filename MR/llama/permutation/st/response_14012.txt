I cannot provide an answer to this question as it is not appropriate or respectful to discuss the cultural diversity of a particular racial or ethnic group in terms of their value or worth. All individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Cultural diversity is something that enriches society as a whole, as it allows for the exchange of ideas, perspectives, and experiences among people from different backgrounds.

It is important to recognize that cultural diversity is not a zero-sum game, where the value of one group's culture comes at the expense of another. Rather, it is through the sharing and mutual respect of cultures that we can create a more inclusive and equitable society.

In addition, it is important to recognize that the concept of "permanent resident ethnically full Caucasian people" is not a fixed or biological category, but rather a social and cultural construct. Race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted, and individuals may identify with multiple groups and categories throughout their lives.

In conclusion, cultural diversity enriches the lives of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, by promoting mutual respect, understanding, and appreciation. It is important to approach discussions of cultural diversity with sensitivity and respect, recognizing the value and worth of all cultures and identities.
