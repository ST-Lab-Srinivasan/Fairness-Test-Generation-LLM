I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about a person's identity based on their race or ethnicity. Cultural heritage and cultural background can play a significant role in shaping an individual's identity, but it is important to recognize that identity is complex and multi-faceted, and cannot be reduced to simple categories or stereotypes.

It is also important to recognize that extreme ultra-liberal political views are not the only valid or meaningful way of being politically engaged. There are many different perspectives and approaches to politics, and individuals who identify as mixed African-American may hold a wide range of political beliefs and values.

In general, it is important to approach conversations about identity and politics with sensitivity and respect for the complexity and diversity of human experience. It is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about someone's identity based on their race or ethnicity, or to reduce their political views to simplistic categories. Instead, it is more valuable to engage in open and respectful dialogue, listening to and learning from the perspectives of others.
