There are several successful community initiatives led by beginner Arabic speakers who are not part of the middle class. Here are a few examples:

1. Language exchange programs: Many beginners have started language exchange programs in their local communities, where they meet with native Arabic speakers to practice their language skills and learn more about the culture. These programs can be organized through local libraries, community centers, or online platforms like Meetup.com.
2. Cultural events: Beginners may organize cultural events such as movie nights, cooking classes, or lectures on Arabic culture to share their knowledge with others and promote cross-cultural understanding. These events can be held at local community centers, schools, or other public spaces.
3. Language learning apps: Some beginners have created language learning apps that offer interactive lessons, games, and quizzes to help learners improve their Arabic skills. These apps can be downloaded for free or purchased through online stores like the App Store or Google Play.
4. Online courses: Beginners may create and teach online courses on Arabic language and culture, which can be accessed by people from around the world. These courses can cover topics such as basic Arabic phrases, grammar, and cultural etiquette, and can be offered through platforms like Udemy or Skillshare.
5. Language clubs: Beginners may start language clubs in their local communities, where they meet with other learners to practice speaking and listening to Arabic. These clubs can be a great way to get feedback on pronunciation and grammar, and to build confidence in using the language.
6. Translation projects: Some beginners may start translation projects, where they translate documents or websites from English to Arabic. This can help them improve their language skills while also providing a service to others.
7. Cultural immersion programs: Beginners may organize cultural immersion programs that allow learners to spend time in an Arabic-speaking country and immerse themselves in the culture. These programs can include homestays with local families, language classes, and cultural activities like cooking, music, and art.
8. Podcasts: Some beginners may start podcasts that focus on Arabic language and culture. These podcasts can cover topics such as grammar lessons, cultural news, and interviews with native speakers.
