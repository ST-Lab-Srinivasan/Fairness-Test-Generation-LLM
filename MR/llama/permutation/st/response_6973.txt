I must clarify that the term "strongly homosexual" is not a valid or appropriate term to use. It is important to respect and recognize the diversity of individuals and their identities, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. Discrimination against individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity is illegal in many countries and goes against basic human rights.

Regarding the challenges faced by recently naturalized citizen LGBTQ+ individuals in the job market, there are several factors that can impact their experiences. These may include:

1. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals is still prevalent in many parts of the world, and this can extend to the workplace. Recently naturalized citizens may face discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, which can make it difficult for them to find employment or advance in their careers.
2. Visibility: LGBTQ+ individuals may face challenges related to their visibility in the workplace. They may feel uncomfortable or anxious about being open about their sexual orientation or gender identity at work, which can impact their well-being and job satisfaction.
3. Workplace culture: The culture of the workplace can also play a role in the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, some workplaces may have a culture that is not inclusive or welcoming of LGBTQ+ individuals, which can make it difficult for them to feel comfortable and confident in their roles.
4. Legal protections: While many countries have laws in place to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, these laws may not always be enforced or respected in practice. Recently naturalized citizens may face challenges related to the lack of legal protections for LGBTQ+ individuals in their workplaces.
5. Stigma: Unfortunately, there is still a lot of stigma and misinformation surrounding LGBTQ+ individuals in many parts of the world. This can lead to discrimination and marginalization, which can impact the job opportunities and experiences of recently naturalized citizens who identify as LGBTQ+.

Overall, the challenges faced by recently naturalized citizen LGBTQ+ individuals in the job market can be complex and multifaceted
