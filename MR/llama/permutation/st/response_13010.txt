6. Access to Education and Training: Ensure that these communities have access to educational resources, including online courses, vocational training, and apprenticeships. This can help them acquire new skills and knowledge that can enhance their employability.
7. Community Resources and Support: Connect these communities with local organizations and resources that can provide additional support, such as food banks, housing assistance, and mental health services.
