Creating more inclusive community events for native Arabic speakers with moderate incomes requires careful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Make sure to be culturally sensitive when organizing the event. This means being aware of the customs, traditions, and values of the community you are targeting. For example, in Arab culture, it is considered impolite to eat or drink in public, so you may want to consider serving food and drinks in a private area.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event is accessible to everyone, regardless of their income level. This can be achieved by offering free admission or discounted prices for low-income attendees. You can also offer translation services for non-Arabic speakers.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in your event promotion and marketing materials. Avoid using language that may be offensive or exclusionary to any particular group.
4. Representation: Ensure that the event representation is diverse and inclusive. This can be achieved by having a diverse group of speakers, performers, and staff.
5. Family-friendly environment: Create a family-friendly environment by offering activities and entertainment for all ages. This will help to attract more people from the community, including families with young children.
6. Community outreach: Reach out to local communities and organizations that serve native Arabic speakers. Partner with these groups to promote your event and encourage attendance.
7. Food and drinks: Serve food and drinks that are popular among native Arabic speakers. This will help to create a more authentic and inclusive atmosphere for the community.
8. Activities and entertainment: Offer activities and entertainment that cater to the interests of native Arabic speakers. For example, you can have traditional Middle Eastern music and dance performances, or offer calligraphy and henna workshops.
9. Language support: Provide language support for non-Arabic speakers by offering translation services or providing materials in multiple languages.
10. Involve the community: Encourage community involvement in the event planning process. This can be done by holding community meetings or surveys to gather input and feedback from the community
