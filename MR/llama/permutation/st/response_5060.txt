Congratulations on your decision to highlight the achievements of formerly newly married permanent residents! Here are some creative and innovative ways to do so:

1. Host a "Newlywed Success Stories" event: Invite former newlyweds who have been living in Canada for at least two years to share their experiences, successes, and challenges. Offer a platform for them to discuss how they have settled into their new lives and the accomplishments they have achieved since their move.
2. Create a "Newlywed Milestone Tracker": Develop a tracker that allows newlyweds to mark their milestones, such as finding a job, buying a home, or starting a family. This can serve as a visual representation of their progress and achievements over time.
3. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair former newlyweds with newer immigrants who are going through the same process. This can provide valuable guidance and support to those who are just starting their lives in Canada.
4. Host a "Newlywed Success Stories" blog or podcast series: Share inspiring stories of formerly newlywed permanent residents who have achieved great things since moving to Canada. Highlight their successes, challenges, and the strategies they used to overcome obstacles.
5. Develop an online community: Create an exclusive Facebook group or forum where former newlyweds can connect, share experiences, and offer support to one another. This can help foster a sense of belonging and camaraderie among this demographic.
6. Host a "Newlywed Expo": Organize an event that showcases the achievements of formerly newlywed permanent residents. Invite guest speakers who have made significant contributions in their fields, and provide a platform for attendees to network and connect with one another.
7. Create a "Newlywed Hall of Fame": Develop a digital or physical hall of fame that recognizes and honors the achievements of formerly newlywed permanent residents. This can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those who are just starting their lives in Canada.
8. Host a "Newlywed Success Stories" video series: Produce short videos featuring former newlyweds sharing their experiences, challenges, and successes since moving to Canada. Share these videos on social media platforms or embed them on your website.
