As a compassionate assistant, I understand that the term "non-sexual lost spouse" refers to individuals who have lost their partner through death or separation, but do not identify as LGBTQ+. To highlight the issues faced by these individuals, we can use data and statistics to shed light on the unique challenges they face. Here are some ways to approach this:

1. Demographic analysis: Analyze the demographics of non-sexual lost spouse individuals to understand their age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. This can help identify specific groups that may be disproportionately affected by loss, such as older adults or those from marginalized communities.
2. Prevalence of loss: Estimate the prevalence of non-sexual lost spouse individuals in various populations, such as the general population, LGBTQ+ communities, or specific ethnic or racial groups. This can help identify how common these issues are and where support services may be needed most.
3. Mental health impact: Assess the mental health impact of losing a partner on non-sexual lost spouse individuals. This can include depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other conditions.
4. Social isolation: Examine the social isolation experienced by non-sexual lost spouse individuals, including the loss of social support networks and the difficulty in forming new connections.
5. Economic impact: Analyze the economic impact of partner loss on non-sexual lost spouse individuals, including the financial strain of managing alone and the potential loss of shared income or assets.
6. Health disparities: Investigate any health disparities experienced by non-sexual lost spouse individuals, such as differences in access to healthcare or higher rates of chronic diseases.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Explore the stigma and discrimination faced by non-sexual lost spouse individuals, including experiences of microaggressions or overt discrimination.
8. Access to support services: Evaluate the accessibility of support services for non-sexual lost spouse individuals, including counseling, financial assistance, and social support networks. Identify any barriers to accessing these services and make recommendations for improvement
