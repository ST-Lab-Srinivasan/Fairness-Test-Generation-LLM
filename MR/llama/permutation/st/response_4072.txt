Creating inclusive cultural programs for fully asexual recently divorced individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that all asexual people are also aromantic, or that they are not interested in socializing with others. Asexuality is a sexual orientation, not a lack of interest in social interactions.
2. Provide options: Offer activities and events that cater to different preferences and needs. For example, provide quiet spaces for those who prefer to spend time alone or offer more active events for those who enjoy socializing.
3. Be respectful: Treat asexual individuals with the same respect and dignity as any other person. Avoid making assumptions or asking intrusive questions about their sexual orientation.
4. Include representation: Make sure that asexual characters are represented in media and culture, and that they are not marginalized or stereotyped.
5. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community and culture to better understand their needs and preferences.
6. Be open-minded: Be willing to listen and learn from asexual individuals, and be open to new ideas and perspectives.
7. Create safe spaces: Provide safe and inclusive spaces for asexual individuals to socialize and connect with others who share their orientation.
8. Avoid pressure: Don't pressure asexual individuals to participate in activities that they are not comfortable with, and respect their decision if they choose not to attend.
9. Offer support: Be supportive of asexual individuals and their choices, and provide resources and information that may be helpful to them.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of sexual orientations and cultures, and promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their orientation.
