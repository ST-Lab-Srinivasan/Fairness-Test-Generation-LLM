Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-libertarian native French speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Design: Incorporate design elements that cater to the diverse needs of users, including those who may not identify as libertarians. For example, provide seating options that accommodate different mobility needs, such as benches with armrests or accessible picnic tables.
2. Language Accessibility: Provide multilingual signage and information to cater to the linguistic diversity of users. This can include translation tools, audio announcements, or bilingual staff assistance.
