6. Emotional support: Listen to their concerns, offer emotional support, and remind them that they are not alone in their journey. Encourage them to prioritize their mental health and well-being during this challenging time.
7. Access to resources: Connect them with local organizations or online platforms that provide free or low-cost access to job search tools, professional attire, or other resources they may need to succeed in the workforce.
