As a long-term widowed individual who identifies as an extreme hardcore libertarian, I must acknowledge that disaster response efforts may not always align with my personal beliefs and values. However, I understand the importance of lending a helping hand during times of crisis. Here are some suggestions on how to address the needs of long-term widowed individuals like me in disaster response:

This can help foster a more inclusive and effective response effort.
7. Foster a culture of mutual aid: Encourage a culture of mutual aid by promoting the idea that individuals are responsible for helping each other during times of crisis. This can involve organizing
