Supporting the social inclusion of older adults, including those who are beginners in Arabic, is essential for their overall well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to promote social inclusion for this age group:

1. Language classes: Offer beginner Arabic language classes specifically designed for older adults. This will help them learn the language and connect with others who share their interest.
2. Cultural events: Organize cultural events, such as traditional Arab music and dance performances, to engage older adults in the community. This can help them feel more connected to the culture and people they are learning about.
3. Intergenerational programs: Develop intergenerational programs that bring together older adults and younger generations. This could include activities like mentorship, storytelling, or joint volunteering opportunities.
4. Technology workshops: Offer technology workshops specifically tailored to the needs and abilities of older adults. This can help them stay connected with the world and maintain their independence.
5. Social clubs: Establish social clubs for older adults, where they can interact with others who share similar interests. This could include book clubs, gardening clubs, or hobby groups.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Provide opportunities for older adults to volunteer in their community. This can help them stay engaged and active while also giving back to society.
7. Outings and excursions: Organize outings and excursions to local cultural attractions, parks, or other age-appropriate activities. This can help older adults get out of the house and socialize with others in a fun and engaging setting.
8. Support groups: Facilitate support groups for older adults, either in-person or online, where they can share experiences and connect with others who may be going through similar challenges.
9. Community service projects: Develop community service projects that older adults can participate in, such as cleaning up local parks or volunteering at food banks. This can help them feel useful and connected to their community.
10. Celebrations and festivals: Organize celebrations and festivals that promote cultural exchange and inclusion. This could include events like Eid al-Fitr, Christmas, or other cultural holidays.
