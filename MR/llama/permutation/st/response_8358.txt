Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development and integration of Native American recent immigrants to the United States, particularly for those who are over the age of 65 (and therefore over 85). Here are some ways mentorship can benefit this group:

1. Cultural bridge-building: Mentors can help recent immigrants navigate the cultural differences between their home country and the US, facilitating a smoother transition and reducing feelings of isolation.
2. Language acquisition: For those who are not fluent in English, mentors can provide language support and practice, which is crucial for successful integration and access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities.
3. Accessing resources: Mentors can help recent immigrants identify and access essential resources such as healthcare services, government benefits, and community organizations that cater to their needs.
4. Building social connections: Mentors can facilitate the formation of social connections with other Native American communities in the US, helping recent immigrants build a support network and feel more connected to their new home.
5. Preserving cultural heritage: Mentors can help recent immigrants preserve their cultural heritage by sharing traditional practices, stories, and values, which can be an important source of comfort and identity during the transition to a new country.
6. Coping with trauma: Many Native American recent immigrants have experienced trauma related to conflict, displacement, or discrimination in their home countries or during their migration journey. Mentors can provide emotional support and coping strategies to help them manage these experiences and build resilience.
7. Fostering resilience: Mentors can encourage recent immigrants to draw upon their strengths, values, and cultural practices to navigate challenges and build a fulfilling life in the US. This can foster resilience and help them adapt to new circumstances.
8. Networking opportunities: Mentors can introduce recent immigrants to their professional networks, which can lead to job opportunities, business partnerships, or other connections that benefit their integration into the US society.
9. Building trust: Establishing a mentorship relationship with a trustworthy and culturally knowledgeable individual can help recent immigrants feel more secure and confident in
