The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are not conservative. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited freedom of expression: In countries with strict military regimes, there may be limitations on the freedom of expression and press freedom. This can make it difficult for non-conservative individuals to express their opinions openly, as they may face censorship or even reprisals for speaking out against the government.
2. Repression of dissent: Military governments are often characterized by a strong desire to maintain order and control, which can lead to the suppression of dissenting voices. This can result in human rights abuses, such as arbitrary arrests, detention without trial, and torture.
3.
