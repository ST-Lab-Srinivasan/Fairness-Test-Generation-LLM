Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers from an ethnically full Asian background requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures. Avoid using terms or phrases that stereotype or marginalize any particular group. For example, use "Asian" instead of "Oriental," which has been historically seen as offensive.
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural programs you offer represent a diverse range of Asian cultures. This can be achieved by featuring different countries, languages, customs, and traditions. For example, you could include programs on Japanese tea ceremonies, Korean K-pop, or Filipino food festivals.
3. Accessibility: Make sure your cultural programs are accessible to all, regardless of their English proficiency level. Offer programs that cater to beginners and provide opportunities for language learning and cultural exchange. For example, you could offer beginner-friendly workshops on basic phrases in Asian languages or cultural etiquette.
4. Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and community groups to reach a wider audience. This can help you tap into existing networks and build relationships with ethnically full Asian communities. For example, you could partner with a local Asian grocery store or restaurant to co-host a cultural event.
5. Education and Awareness: Educate yourself and others about the diversity of Asian cultures and histories. This can help dispel stereotypes and promote understanding and appreciation. For example, you could organize workshops on the history and significance of different Asian festivals or traditions.
6. Intersectionality: Be mindful of the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and other factors that may affect an individual's experience of cultural programs. Ensure that your programs are inclusive and respectful of all identities and experiences. For example, you could offer programs that cater specifically to LGBTQ+ Asian communities or women-only spaces.
7. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to ensure that your cultural programs are meeting the needs and expectations of the ethnically full Asian community
