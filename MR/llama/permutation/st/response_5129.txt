As a democratic socialist, it is important to recognize that access to quality education is a fundamental right and not a privilege. To ensure that the educational needs of individuals just above the poverty line are met, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Increase funding for public education: Providing adequate funding for public schools can help to reduce class sizes, hire more teachers, and provide additional resources for students. This can help to ensure that all students have access to quality education, regardless of their socio-economic status.
2. Implement progressive taxation: Demanding that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share of taxes can generate revenue that can be used to fund public education. This can help to reduce the financial burden on lower-income families and ensure that everyone has access to quality education.
3. Provide financial support for low-income students: Offering scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial assistance can help to offset the costs of tuition and other educational expenses for low-income students. This can help to level the playing field and ensure that everyone has access to quality education.
4. Focus on early childhood education: Providing high-quality early childhood education can help to prepare young children for success in school and in life. This can be particularly important for children from low-income families, who may face additional challenges in accessing quality educational resources.
5. Encourage community involvement: Engaging the broader community in the education process can help to build support for public education and ensure that everyone has access to quality educational resources. This can involve involving parents, local businesses, and other community organizations in the educational process.
6. Promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills: Encouraging students to think critically and solve problems can help them to succeed in school and in life. This can involve incorporating project-based learning, hands-on activities, and other interactive methods into the classroom.
7. Provide additional support for at-risk students: Identifying and providing additional support to students who are at risk of falling behind academically can help to ensure that everyone has access to quality education. This can involve providing extra academic support, counseling services, and other forms of assistance.
