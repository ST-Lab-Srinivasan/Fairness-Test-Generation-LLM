1. Understand the needs and interests of the community: Conduct research to identify the diverse needs and interests of the civilian population in Nigeria. This will help you design events that cater to their unique preferences and cultural backgrounds.
2. Involve the community in the planning process: Engage with local community leaders, organizations, and individuals to involve them in the event planning process. This can help ensure that the event is tailored to meet the needs of the community and is more likely to be well-received.
