Supporting the educational aspirations of native Chinese speakers who are separated can be challenging, but there are several ways to help them achieve their goals. Here are some strategies that you can consider:

1. Provide language support: Native Chinese speakers may face difficulties in learning a new language, especially if they are not exposed to it regularly. Offer language classes or hire a tutor who is fluent in both Chinese and the local language to help them improve their language skills.
