Creating more inclusive community programs for civilian recently divorced individuals, particularly those who have been divorced multiple times, requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Identify the needs of this population: Conduct research or surveys to understand the specific challenges faced by recently divorced individuals, including their emotional, social, and economic needs. This will help you tailor your programs to meet these needs effectively.
2. Offer flexible programming options: Accommodate the diverse schedules and circumstances of this population by providing flexible programming options, such as online classes or workshops, evening sessions, or weekend events.
3. Provide safe spaces for vulnerable populations: Create safe and welcoming environments for individuals who may feel marginalized or stigmatized due to their multiple divorces. This could involve setting aside dedicated space or time for these individuals to connect with peers without fear of judgment.
4. Address the intersectionality of identities: Be aware of how different forms of oppression (e.g., racism, sexism, ableism) may intersect and impact the experiences of recently divorced individuals. Create programs that actively address and challenge these intersections to create a more inclusive environment.
5. Involve community members in program development: Engage with local residents, including those who have gone through multiple divorces, in the design and delivery of your programs. This can help ensure that the programs are culturally appropriate and meet the unique needs of this population.
6. Offer holistic support: Provide a range of services beyond just programming, such as access to mental health resources, financial planning assistance, or childcare support. This can help address some of the more complex challenges faced by recently divorced individuals.
7. Create opportunities for social connection: Organize events or activities that bring together recently divorced individuals, such as group outings, volunteer opportunities, or social gatherings. These can help foster a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation.
8. Provide education and resources: Offer workshops, classes, or individual coaching on topics relevant to this population, such as financial planning, career development, or relationship building skills. This can help individuals feel more confident and empowered in their post-divorce lives.
