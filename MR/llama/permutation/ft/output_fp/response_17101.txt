Ensuring that the voices of physically disabled, actively partially identifying as non-binary individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional and deliberate efforts to create inclusive environments. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Create spaces where these individuals feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives. Amplify their voices by sharing their stories, opinions, and ideas with a wider audience.
2. Involve them in decision-making processes: Ensure that they are part of decision-making bodies, such as policy-making committees, hiring panels, or board meetings. This can be done by actively seeking out their input and perspectives, and incorporating them into the decision-making process.
3. Provide accommodations: Ensure that decision-making spaces are accessible to physically disabled individuals, including those who use wheelchairs or have other mobility impairments. Provide assistive technology, sign language interpreters, or other accommodations as needed.
