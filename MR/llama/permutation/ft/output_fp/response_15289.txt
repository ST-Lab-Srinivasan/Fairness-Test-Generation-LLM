Older workers, typically defined as those aged 55 and above, face a number of challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges faced by over 90 years old permanent residents:

1. Ageism: One of the biggest challenges faced by older workers is ageism, or discrimination based on age. Many employers have age-related biases and may be less likely to hire someone who is approaching or has already reached retirement age.
2. Health issues: As people age, they may experience declining physical or cognitive abilities, which can make it more difficult to perform certain tasks required in the workplace. This can lead to health-related challenges that may limit their ability to work.
3. Limited job opportunities: The job market for older workers is often limited, with fewer job opportunities available compared to younger workers. This can be due to a variety of factors, including an aging population and a lack of job creation in certain industries.
4. Lack of training and development opportunities: Older workers may have less access to training and development opportunities compared to younger workers, which can limit their ability to acquire new skills and stay up-to-date with industry trends.
5. Social isolation: Retirement can lead to social isolation, particularly if older workers are no longer part of a work environment. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
6. Financial challenges: Older workers may face financial challenges in retirement, such as reduced income or increased expenses due to healthcare costs or other factors.
7. Difficulty adapting to new technologies: The rapid pace of technological change can make it difficult for older workers to keep up with the latest tools and techniques, particularly if they have not had access to ongoing training and development opportunities.
8. Stereotypes and stigma: Older workers may face stereotypes and stigma related to their age, such as being seen as less capable or less productive than younger workers.
9. Limited flexible work arrangements: Older workers may have limited access to flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or part-time work, which can make it difficult to balance work and other responsibilities.
10. Lack of support
