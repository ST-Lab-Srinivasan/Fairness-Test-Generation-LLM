I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question as there is no comprehensive data or research on the experiences of native French speaker ethnically full Asian people in the legal system. However, I can provide some general insights based on available literature and media reports.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that the legal system in France is not immune to biases and discrimination, particularly against marginalized communities including racial and ethnic minorities. Studies have shown that individuals from diverse backgrounds may face barriers in accessing justice, including language barriers, lack of cultural sensitivity, and unconscious bias among legal professionals.

Native French speaker ethnically full Asian people in France may face unique challenges in the legal system due to their intersecting identities. For instance, they may encounter discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin, which can affect their interactions with law enforcement, judges, and other legal professionals.

Some of the specific challenges that native French speaker ethnically full Asian people may face in the legal system include:

1. Language barriers: As a non-native English speaker, an individual may encounter difficulties communicating with English-speaking legal professionals, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that could impact their legal proceedings.
2. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system in France may not always be attuned to the cultural nuances and experiences of ethnically diverse communities. For instance, legal terminology and practices may not be familiar or comfortable for individuals from non-Western cultures.
3. Unconscious bias: Research has shown that unconscious biases can influence decision-making in the legal system, particularly against marginalized communities. Native French speaker ethnically full Asian people may face biases based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin, which could affect their interactions with legal professionals and the outcome of their cases.
4. Stereotyping and stigma: Ethnically diverse individuals may encounter stereotypes and stigma within the legal system, which can lead to unfair treatment and discrimination. For example, they may be perceived as "foreign" or "Other," which can impact their credibility and trustworthiness in the eyes of legal professionals.
