Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique cultural, social, and historical contexts. Here are some strategies that educators and policymakers can consider:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American recent immigrants may face challenges adapting to mainstream educational settings due to cultural differences. Educators can use culturally responsive teaching practices, such as incorporating traditional knowledge and perspectives into the curriculum, to create a more inclusive learning environment.

Educators can provide language support services, such as bilingual education programs or English language learner (ELL) classes, to help them improve their language skills.
3. Cultural orientation: Newly arrived Native American immigrants may need guidance on how to navigate the US educational system. Educators can offer cultural orientation programs that provide information on academic expectations, school policies, and social norms.
4. Mentorship and support: Pairing recent immigrants with experienced mentors who share their cultural background can help them adjust to the new environment. Mentors can provide emotional support, answer questions, and help navigate the educational system.
5. Community engagement: Building partnerships with Native American communities and organizations can help educators better understand the needs of recent immigrants and provide more effective support. Community engagement can also help increase student motivation and involvement in education.

7. Professional development: Providing educators with professional development opportunities that focus on culturally responsive teaching, language support, and cultural competency can help them better serve the needs of Native American recent immigrants.
8. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocating for policies that address the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants in education can lead to systemic changes that promote greater inclusivity and equity in schools.
