Creating more inclusive cultural events for permanent residents, especially those who identify as bisexual, requires intentionally designing and implementing events that acknowledge and cater to their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions on how to create a more inclusive environment:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" and "women") and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities, such as "everyone," "all genders," or "gender-diverse individuals."
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural event includes representation from diverse backgrounds, including race, ethnicity, age, ability, and sexual orientation. This can be achieved by intentionally seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences in the planning process.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to all attendees, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
4. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that caters to the unique needs and experiences of bisexual individuals. This can include workshops on bisexuality-specific topics, such as navigating discrimination, building support networks, or exploring identity.
5. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for attendees to express themselves without fear of judgment or harassment. Provide clear guidelines and consequences for any behavior that violates these spaces.
6. Education and Training: Offer educational resources and training for event staff, volunteers, and performers to better understand and address the needs of bisexual individuals. This can include workshops on LGBTQ+ issues, cultural competency, and inclusive programming.
7. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement by providing opportunities for attendees to connect with each other and build support networks. This can be achieved through social events, networking sessions, or online communities.
8. Visibility: Use marketing materials and promotional content to visibly promote the event's inclusivity and welcoming environment. Highlight the importance of diversity and representation in the cultural event.
