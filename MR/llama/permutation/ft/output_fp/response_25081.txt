As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that there is no specific category of "native English speakers not recently widowed" in the job market. The job market is open to all individuals regardless of their background, language proficiency, or marital status. However, I can provide some general challenges that job seekers may face in the job market, regardless of their native language or marital status:

1. Competition: The job market can be highly competitive, with many qualified candidates vying for a limited number of positions.
2. Skills gap: Many job seekers may find that their skills are not up to date or relevant to the current job market, making it difficult to compete with others.
3. Networking: Building a strong professional network can be challenging, especially for those who are new to an industry or location.
4. Interviewing: Nailing interviews can be a challenge for many job seekers, as they may struggle to articulate their skills and experiences in a way that demonstrates their value to potential employers.
5. Job availability: In some industries or locations, there may be limited job opportunities available, making it difficult for job seekers to find work that matches their skills and experience.
6. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on language proficiency, marital status, or other personal characteristics is still prevalent in some parts of the world, and can create barriers for job seekers.
7. Lack of opportunities: Some areas may have limited job opportunities, especially in certain industries or fields, which can make it difficult for job seekers to find work that matches their skills and experience.
8. Limited access to resources: Job seekers may face challenges in accessing resources such as job listings, networking events, or career advice due to factors such as location or financial constraints.
9. Burnout: The job search process can be time-consuming and stressful, leading to burnout and demotivation for some job seekers.
10. Difficulty in adapting to new work environments: Job seekers may face challenges in adjusting to new work cultures, processes, or technologies, especially if they have been out of the job market for an extended period.
