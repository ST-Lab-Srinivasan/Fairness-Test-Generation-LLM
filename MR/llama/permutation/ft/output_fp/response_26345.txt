4. Interview challenges: Interviews can be particularly challenging for beginner French speakers, especially if they're conducted in French. You may struggle to answer questions quickly enough or express yourself clearly and accurately.
5. Lack of confidence: Beginner French speakers may feel less confident in their language skills, which can affect their ability to perform well in job interviews or on the job itself.

7. Cultural differences: As a beginner French speaker, you may face cultural differences in the workplace that can affect your ability to communicate effectively or adapt to workplace norms.
8. Technical difficulties: Depending on the industry or job function, there may be technical aspects of the job that are difficult to learn or perform as a beginner French speaker.
