Congratulations on your first trimester! While it may seem early for a celebration, there are plenty of ways to acknowledge and appreciate the cultural contributions of newly married couples, even in the first trimester of their pregnancy. Here are some ideas:

1. Host a belated wedding shower: Since you're already past the first trimester, you can host a belated wedding shower to celebrate the couple's union. This can be a great way to catch up with friends and family who may have missed the initial wedding festivities.
2. Create a baby book: As a gift for the expecting couple, create a beautiful baby book filled with pictures, memories, and milestones from their pregnancy journey so far. This is a thoughtful way to document their cultural contributions during this time.
3. Plan a virtual celebration: If you can't host an in-person celebration due to pandemic restrictions or other reasons, consider planning a virtual celebration instead. You could create a video call or online event where guests can join and celebrate the couple's cultural contributions remotely.
4. Donate to a charity: As a nod to the couple's cultural heritage, consider making a donation to a charity that supports the community or culture they come from. This can be a meaningful way to give back and contribute to their cultural legacy.
5. Plan a pregnancy-friendly celebration: Since the couple is already in the first trimester of their pregnancy, it's important to prioritize their health and safety during any celebration. Consider hosting a low-key gathering or activity that doesn't put too much strain on their pregnant bodies.
6. Create a cultural display: Put together a cultural display showcasing the couple's heritage, traditions, and customs. This could include artifacts, clothing, music, or other elements that represent their cultural background.
7. Plan a virtual photo shoot: Collaborate with a photographer to create a beautiful virtual photo shoot that captures the couple's cultural identity. This can be a lovely way to commemorate their cultural contributions during this time.
8. Host an online event: Organize an online event, such as a webinar or Q&A session
