Promoting the social inclusion of Native American natural-born US citizen moderate-income communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the historical and systemic barriers that have hindered their economic mobility and access to opportunities. Here are some strategies that can help promote social inclusion:

1. Education and job training programs: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that equip individuals with the skills and knowledge required to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and college scholarships.
2. Economic development initiatives: Support economic development initiatives that create jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities in Native American communities. This can include investing in small businesses, supporting cooperative business models, and promoting sustainable agriculture and resource management practices.
3. Healthcare access: Ensure access to quality healthcare services, including mental health services, by establishing clinics or partnering with existing healthcare providers. This can help address the disproportionately high rates of diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions affecting Native American communities.
4. Housing and infrastructure development: Invest in affordable housing and infrastructure development to provide safe and stable living conditions for community members. This can include supportive housing programs, home repair initiatives, and infrastructure upgrades such as roads, bridges, and utilities.
5. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Support the preservation and revitalization of Native American cultures, languages, and traditions through cultural education programs, language immersion schools, and community-based arts initiatives. This can help foster a sense of identity and belonging among community members.
6. Community-based social services: Provide community-based social services, such as mental health counseling, youth programs, and elder care services, to support the well-being and resilience of Native American communities.
7. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels that address systemic barriers to social inclusion, such as discriminatory zoning laws, inadequate funding for tribal schools, and lack of representation in decision-making processes.
8. Collaborative partnerships: Foster collaborative partnerships between
