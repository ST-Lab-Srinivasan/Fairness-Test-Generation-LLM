Supporting advanced over 90 years old (over 85) native Chinese speaker communities can be challenging due to various factors such as cognitive decline, hearing and vision loss, and decreased mobility. However, there are several effective strategies that can help support these communities:

1. Language classes tailored to their needs: Offer language classes specifically designed for this age group, taking into account their cognitive abilities and physical limitations. These classes could focus on basic communication skills, such as expressing personal information, shopping, and using transportation.
2. Technology-based interventions: Utilize technology, such as tablets or smartphones, to provide interactive language learning experiences. Apps like Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, or language learning podcasts can be useful tools for this age group.
3. Socialization opportunities: Organize social events and gatherings where older Chinese speakers can practice their language skills in a relaxed setting. This could include tea parties, book clubs, or other activities that promote social interaction and language use.
4. Storytelling and reminiscence therapy: Encourage older Chinese speakers to share stories from their past, using language as a means of expressing themselves. This can help maintain cognitive function and foster a sense of community.
5. Home visits or house calls: Offer language classes or practice sessions in the comfort of older Chinese speakers' own homes. This can be especially helpful for those with mobility issues, as it eliminates the need to travel to a designated location.
6. Multisensory approaches: Incorporate different sensory experiences, such as music, art, or movement, into language learning activities. This can help stimulate cognitive function and make language learning more engaging.
7. Collaboration with healthcare professionals: Work with healthcare providers to identify older Chinese speakers who may benefit from language support. Healthcare professionals can refer these individuals to language programs or provide them with resources for practice.
8. Outreach and community partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that serve older adults, such as senior centers or retirement communities. Offer language classes or practice sessions at these locations to reach a wider audience.
9. Cultural events and activities: Organize cultural events and activities that promote language use and
