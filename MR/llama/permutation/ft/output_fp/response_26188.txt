As a beginner Chinese speaker, children may face several challenges when navigating the healthcare system in China. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: As a non-native Chinese speaker, children may struggle to communicate their symptoms or concerns to medical professionals, which can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed treatment.
