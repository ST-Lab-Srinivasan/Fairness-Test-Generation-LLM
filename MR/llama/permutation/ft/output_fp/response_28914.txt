As a sociologist, I must inform you that there is no specific group of people called "recently divorced democratic socialists." Democratic socialism is a political ideology that advocates for a mix of economic and social equality, as well as the collective ownership of the means of production. It does not necessarily have any direct impact on an individual's marital status or personal life.

Marriage and divorce are complex social institutions that can have far-reaching consequences for individuals, regardless of their political beliefs. The impact of marital status on a person's life can vary greatly depending on factors such as cultural norms, legal frameworks, and individual circumstances. Here are some potential impacts of marital status on the lives of individuals:

1. Emotional toll: Going through a divorce can be emotionally challenging, especially if there are children involved or if one partner is blamed or shamed for the breakdown of the marriage. Divorced individuals may experience feelings of sadness, grief, anger, and anxiety.
2. Financial instability: Divorce can lead to financial insecurity, as two incomes become one. This can be especially challenging for those who were previously financially reliant on their spouse. Democratic socialists may prioritize economic equality and may experience financial difficulties as a result of divorce.
3. Social isolation: Divorce can lead to social isolation, particularly if the couple had a close-knit social circle. Divorced individuals may find themselves without a support network, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
4. Child custody arrangements: If there are children involved in the divorce, the custody arrangement can have a significant impact on the lives of both parents. Democratic socialists may prioritize the well-being of children and may advocate for shared or joint custody arrangements.
5. Identity reconstruction: Divorce can lead to identity reconstruction as individuals redefine themselves outside of their marital roles. This can be a challenging but potentially transformative experience, particularly for those who have been deeply embedded in traditional gender roles and expectations.
6. Newfound independence: Going through a divorce can lead to newfound independence, as individuals learn to navigate the world on their own
