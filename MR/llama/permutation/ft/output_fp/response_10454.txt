Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled Nigerians, as it can shape their access to resources, opportunities, and social services. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to education and healthcare: The political affiliation of an individual or family can affect their access to quality education and healthcare. For example, children of wealthy politically connected individuals may have access to better schools and hospitals, while those from less privileged backgrounds may face barriers to accessing these resources.
