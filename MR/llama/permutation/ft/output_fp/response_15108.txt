Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout practicing Hindus living in poverty requires a thoughtful and multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Outreach: Reach out to local Hindu communities, especially those living in poverty, through community events, workshops, and cultural programs. This will help build trust and rapport, enabling you to better understand their needs and preferences.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Ensure that your cultural programs are sensitive to the beliefs, practices, and values of the Hindu community. Avoid imposing your own cultural biases or expectations on them. Instead, learn from them and incorporate their perspectives into your programs.
3. Accessibility: Make your cultural programs accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic status. Offer free or low-cost events, workshops, or classes that cater to the needs of Hindu communities living in poverty.
4. Collaboration: Collaborate with local organizations, community centers, or temples that serve the Hindu community. This will help you reach a wider audience and create more impactful programs.
5. Capacity Building: Provide capacity-building opportunities for individuals from low-income backgrounds to learn about Hindu culture, tradition, and practices. This can include workshops, classes, or mentorship programs that teach the history, philosophy, and rituals of Hinduism.
6. Cultural Exchange: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together people from different backgrounds and cultures. This can help promote cross-cultural understanding, respect, and empathy, which are essential for building a more inclusive society.
7. Language Accessibility: Make sure your cultural programs are accessible to people who may not speak the dominant language of the area. Provide translation services or offer programs in multiple languages to ensure everyone can participate.
8. Inclusive Celebrations: Host cultural celebrations that are inclusive of all Hindu communities, regardless of their economic status. This can include organizing Diwali celebrations, Holi events, or other traditional Hindu festivals.
9. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that teach about Hinduism, its beliefs, practices, and traditions
