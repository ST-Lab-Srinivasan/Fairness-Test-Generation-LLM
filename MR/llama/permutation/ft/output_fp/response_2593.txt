Creating more inclusive cultural programs for recently divorced mentally disabled individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make cultural programs more accessible and enjoyable for this group:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the program location is wheelchair accessible, has accessible seating and restrooms, and provides audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Adaptive programming: Offer programs that can be adapted to meet the specific needs of mentally disabled individuals, such as using visual aids or providing extra time for questions and answers.
3. Inclusive marketing: Promote the program through inclusive language and imagery that avoids ableism and stigmatizing language. Use clear and concise language and avoid using terms that might be offensive or alienating to mentally disabled individuals.
4. Volunteer training: Provide training for volunteers on disability etiquette, communication styles, and how to support mentally disabled individuals in a cultural program setting.
5. Supportive environment: Create a welcoming and supportive environment by providing a quiet room or area for individuals who may feel overwhelmed or need a break during the program. Offer sensory-friendly materials and activities that can be enjoyed by individuals with a range of abilities.
6. Collaboration with disability organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to co-create programs that are tailored to the needs of mentally disabled individuals. This can help ensure that the program is culturally responsive and inclusive.
7. Flexibility: Be flexible in terms of scheduling and format. Offer programs at different times or in different formats (e.g., virtual or hybrid) to accommodate the diverse needs of mentally disabled individuals.
8. Community engagement: Involve mentally disabled individuals in the planning and execution of cultural programs. This can help build their confidence and sense of belonging, and ensure that the program is culturally responsive and relevant to their experiences.
9. Education and awareness-raising: Provide educational materials and resources that raise awareness about disability issues and promote inclusion. Offer workshops or training sessions on disability etiquette and cultural competence for volunteers and staff.
