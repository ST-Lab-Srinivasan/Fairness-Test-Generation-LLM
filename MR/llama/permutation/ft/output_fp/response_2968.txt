Creating more inclusive social policies for upper lower middle-income long-term widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognize the distinct experiences of long-term widows: Long-term widows often face unique challenges, such as social isolation, loss of economic security, and emotional distress. Policies should recognize these differences and provide targeted support to address them.
2. Increase access to financial assistance: Many long-term widows struggle with financial insecurity due to the loss of their partner's income. Governments can establish or enhance programs that provide financial assistance, such as pension top-ups, one-time payments, or ongoing monthly stipends.
3. Promote access to healthcare: Long-term widows may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to loss of insurance coverage or decreased mobility. Governments can improve access to affordable healthcare by expanding public insurance programs, providing subsidies for private insurance, or investing in telemedicine services.
4. Address social isolation: Long-term widows often experience social isolation due to the loss of their partner and reduced social connections. Governments can encourage community engagement by funding programs that provide social activities, transportation, or home-based care services.
5. Provide mental health support: Grief and trauma are common among long-term widows. Mental health professionals should be trained to work with this population, and governments can provide funding for counseling services or hotlines.
6. Encourage education and skill-building: Many long-term widows may feel unfulfilled or uncertain about their future career prospects. Governments can offer vocational training, online courses, or scholarships to help them acquire new skills and pursue meaningful employment.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Long-term widows may feel disconnected from younger generations. Governments can establish mentorship programs that pair older widows with young people, allowing them to share experiences and build relationships.
8. Advocate for age-friendly policies: Governments should develop age-friendly policies that recognize the unique needs of long-term widows
