Promoting the accessibility of public services for ethnically full Caucasian, actively partially identifying as non-binary individuals requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide training and education to public service providers on the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals. This can help them understand and address the unique needs of this community.
2. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., male/female) and instead use terms such as "they/them" or "their/theirs."
3. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that public facilities are accessible to non-binary individuals. This can include providing gender-neutral bathrooms, as well as signage and other visual cues that acknowledge and respect non-binary identities.
4. Identification Options: Offer gender-neutral identification options on forms and documents. For example, provide a "non-binary" or "genderqueer" option in addition to male/female.
5. Training for Public Facing Staff: Provide training for public facing staff on how to interact with non-binary individuals. This can include learning about the experiences of non-binary individuals and how to provide respectful and inclusive service.
6. Consultation and Involvement: Engage with non-binary communities and organizations to ensure that services are designed and delivered in an inclusive manner. This can involve consulting with non-binary individuals and organizations on the design of services, as well as involving them in decision-making processes.
7. Policies and Procedures: Develop policies and procedures that are inclusive of non-binary identities. For example, a policy that allows individuals to use their preferred name and pronouns can help promote respect and inclusivity.
8. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the experiences of non-binary individuals and the importance of inclusive service delivery. This can involve partnering with local organizations and events to reach a wider audience.
9. Performance Metrics: Develop performance metrics that measure the accessibility and inclusivity of public services for non-binary individuals. This
