Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deep in poverty but have not been married for a long time requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the unique challenges and needs of this demographic. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Focus on education and job training: Many individuals who are not deep in poverty but have not been married for a long time may face barriers to finding and keeping stable employment. Providing access to education and job training programs can help them acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the labor market.
2. Offer support for childcare: Many people who are not deep in poverty but have not been married for a long time may be struggling to balance work and family responsibilities, particularly if they have children. Providing affordable childcare options or supporting families with financial assistance can help them better manage their responsibilities.
3. Encourage social connections: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for individuals who are not deep in poverty but have not been married for a long time. Encouraging social connections through community programs, volunteer opportunities, or other initiatives can help them build relationships and a sense of belonging.
4. Address discrimination and stigma: Unfortunately, there may be discrimination and stigma associated with being an older, never-married individual. Addressing these issues through awareness campaigns, policy changes, or social support programs can help create a more inclusive society.
5. Provide financial assistance: Depending on the specific needs of the individual, providing financial assistance through scholarships, grants, or other forms of aid can help them cover basic expenses, pay off debt, or invest in their future.
6. Support independent living: As individuals age, they may face challenges related to mobility, accessibility, and housing. Providing support for independent living, such as home modifications or assistive technology, can help them maintain their independence and quality of life.
7. Encourage intergenerational connections: Many individuals who are not deep in poverty but have not been married for a long time may feel disconnected from younger generations. Encouraging intergenerational connections through mentorship programs, cultural exchange, or other initiatives can help build bridges between different age groups.
8. Foster community engagement
