Instead of focusing on celebrating the cultural contributions of specific groups, it's important to recognize and appreciate the diversity and individuality of all people. Here are some ways to promote inclusivity and respect for everyone:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the experiences and perspectives of people from different backgrounds and cultures. Learn about their traditions, beliefs, and values, and show genuine interest in their lives.
2. Avoid stereotypes: Refrain from making assumptions or stereotypes based on a person's marital status, pregnancy, or any other personal characteristic. Treat everyone as unique individuals with their own experiences and stories.
3. Promote inclusivity: Encourage diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of life, including workplaces, social events, and communities. Create spaces where everyone feels welcome and valued.
4. Support marginalized groups: Stand in solidarity with marginalized groups, such as those who have experienced discrimination or are facing social inequality. Listen to their voices, amplify their messages, and work towards creating a more equitable society.
5. Embrace diversity: Celebrate the diverse cultures, traditions, and experiences of all people. Recognize that everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their background or circumstances.

By promoting inclusivity and respect for everyone, we can create a more just and equitable society where everyone feels valued and appreciated.
