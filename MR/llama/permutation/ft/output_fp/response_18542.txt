I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide you with some suggestions on how to create more inclusive community events for people who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy and cisgender infant females. Here are some ideas:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using terms like "moms" or "ladies" that may exclude people who do not identify as cisgender women. Instead, use terms like "community members," "attendees," or "guests."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible to people with disabilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
3. Gender-neutral facilities: Provide gender-neutral bathrooms or offer a private changing area for those who may need it.
4. Inclusive programming: Offer activities and workshops that are inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid programs that assume cisgender norms, such as gendered crafting projects or gendered sports teams. Instead, offer activities like yoga, meditation, or creative writing that can be enjoyed by everyone.
5. Safe space policy: Establish a safe space policy that protects attendees from harassment or discrimination based on their gender identity or expression. Train event staff and volunteers on how to recognize and address any incidents of harassment or discrimination.
6. Inclusive advertising: Use language in event advertising that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using language like "expectant mothers" or "moms-to-be," instead use terms like "community members" or "attendees."
7. Partner with LGBTQ+ organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations to co-host the event or promote it through their channels. This can help reach a more diverse audience and create a more inclusive environment.
8. Flexible scheduling: Offer events at times that are convenient for people with different work schedules, childcare responsibilities, or other commitments. This can include evenings or weekends when
