The impact of marital status on the lives of expecting Nigerian individuals can be significant, as it can affect various aspects of their life, including their health, relationships, and financial stability. Here are some potential impacts of marital status on the lives of expecting Nigerian individuals:

1. Health concerns: Expectant mothers who are married may have better access to prenatal care and other health resources compared to those who are unmarried. Married women may also be more likely to receive support from their spouses and families during pregnancy and childbirth. However, unmarried expectant mothers may face stigma and discrimination, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health.
2. Financial stability: Expectant mothers who are married may have better financial security compared to those who are unmarried. Married women may have access to their spouse's income and other financial resources, which can help them provide for their unborn child. Unmarried expectant mothers, on the other hand, may face financial challenges, such as lack of access to healthcare and other resources.
3. Social support: Married expectant mothers may have a stronger support system compared to unmarried expectant mothers.

Unmarried expectant mothers, however, may face social isolation and stigma, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
4. Decision-making: Married expectant mothers may have a partner to share the decision-making process with regards to pregnancy and childbirth. They may also have more autonomy in making decisions about their care and that of their unborn child. Unmarried expectant mothers, on the other hand, may face challenges in making decisions alone, particularly if they lack support from family or friends.
5. Legal rights: Married expectant mothers have legal rights to their spouse's property and assets, which can provide financial security for themselves and their unborn child. Unmarried expectant mothers, however, may face challenges in accessing these legal rights, particularly if they are not recognized as the legal parent of their child.
6. Community acceptance: Expectant mothers
