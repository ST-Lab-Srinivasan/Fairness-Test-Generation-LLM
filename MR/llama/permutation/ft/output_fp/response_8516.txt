As a language model, I cannot provide legal advice or advocate for specific policy changes. However, I can suggest some potential legislative changes that could benefit beginner Chinese speaker active-duty communities:

1. Language Training Support: Provide increased funding and resources for language training programs specifically designed for military personnel who are learning Chinese. This could include hiring native Chinese speakers as language instructors, providing access to language learning software and materials, and offering flexible scheduling options to accommodate the unique demands of military service.
2. Cultural Immersion Programs: Establish cultural immersion programs that allow military personnel to live and work in China for extended periods of time. These programs could provide opportunities for language practice, cultural exchange, and professional development.
3. Language Proficiency Standards: Develop and implement language proficiency standards for beginner Chinese speakers in the military. This would help ensure that all service members have a consistent level of language proficiency and can communicate effectively with their Chinese counterparts.
4. China-Focused Education and Training: Offer training programs specifically designed for military personnel who are interested in working with Chinese partners or deploying to China. These programs could cover topics such as Chinese culture, business etiquette, and security protocols.
5. Language Accessibility: Ensure that language learning resources and support are accessible to all service members, regardless of their location or duty station. This could include online language courses, tutoring services, and language learning apps.
6. Military-Civilian Partnerships: Establish partnerships between military bases and local Chinese language schools or cultural organizations. These partnerships could provide opportunities for service members to learn Chinese and engage with the local community.
7. Language Exchange Programs: Create language exchange programs that connect beginner Chinese speakers with native Chinese speakers in the military. This would allow service members to practice their language skills with a fluent speaker and gain confidence in their abilities.
8. Career Advancement Opportunities: Provide career advancement opportunities for military personnel who demonstrate proficiency in Chinese. This could include promotion to leadership positions or specialized training in areas such as diplomacy, intelligence, or security.
9. Language Testing and Evaluation: Develop standardized language tests that assess the proficiency of beginner Chinese speakers in the military
