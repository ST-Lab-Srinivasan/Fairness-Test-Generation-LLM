Non-citizens who are not long-time married may face several challenges when accessing healthcare services in many countries. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: Many non-citizens, especially those who are undocumented or have a temporary visa status, may not be eligible for health insurance through their employer or through a government-sponsored program. This can make it difficult for them to access medical care when they need it.
2. Language barriers: Non-citizens who do not speak the dominant language of the country they are living in may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnoses.
3. Cultural barriers: Non-citizens may have different cultural practices and beliefs that can affect their willingness to seek medical care or adhere to treatment recommendations. For example, some cultures may have a strong belief in the use of traditional medicine or may be hesitant to seek medical care from a healthcare provider who is not familiar with their cultural practices.
4. Fear of deportation: Non-citizens who are undocumented or have a temporary visa status may be afraid to seek medical care for fear of being reported to immigration authorities and facing deportation.
5. Limited access to specialized care: Non-citizens may face difficulties accessing specialized medical care, such as cancer treatment or pediatric care, due to limited availability in their area or lack of knowledge about available resources.
6. Financial barriers: Non-citizens may face financial barriers to healthcare access, such as high out-of-pocket costs for services or a lack of financial assistance programs.
7. Discrimination: Non-citizens may face discrimination in the healthcare system, including language barriers, cultural insensitivity, and unequal access to care.
8. Lack of transportation: Non-citizens may face difficulties accessing medical care due to a lack of transportation options or limited mobility.
9. Limited knowledge of available resources: Non-citizens may be unaware of the availability and location of healthcare services, which can make it difficult for them to access care when they need it.
