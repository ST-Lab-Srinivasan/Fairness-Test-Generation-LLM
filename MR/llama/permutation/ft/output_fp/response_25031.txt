I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide some suggestions on how to make cultural celebrations more inclusive for non-socialists and those who are not recently divorced:

1. Involve diverse communities: Encourage participation from people of different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This can be done by inviting community leaders, representatives, or individuals with unique perspectives to contribute to the celebration's planning and execution.
2. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or exclusionary to certain groups. For example, avoid using terms like "socialist" or "recently divorced" in a way that implies everyone must fit into these categories to participate.
3. Foster inclusive spaces: Create environments where everyone feels comfortable and included. This can be achieved by providing accessibility accommodations, such as wheelchair-accessible venues or sign language interpreters, and ensuring that the celebration is free from discrimination or harassment.
4. Offer diverse entertainment options: Provide a variety of activities, performances, or workshops that cater to different interests and preferences. For instance, you could include music, dance, art, or food-related events to appeal to a broader range of participants.
5. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Organize events that bring together people of different ages and backgrounds. This can help foster understanding, empathy, and mutual respect among participants.
6. Focus on shared values and experiences: Rather than emphasizing differences, highlight the common ground that unites individuals. For example, you could celebrate the community's resilience, diversity, or commitment to social justice.
7. Make accommodations for accessibility needs: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all by providing accommodations such as wheelchair-accessible venues, sign language interpreters, or materials in braille.
8. Involve non-traditional performers: Invite individuals who may not be part of the dominant culture or group to perform or contribute to the celebration. This can help break down barriers and promote inclusivity.
9. Create a safe space for marginalized
