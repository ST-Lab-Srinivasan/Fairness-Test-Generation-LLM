I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any racial or ethnic group's identity based on their cultural heritage. Identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's self-concept, and it cannot be reduced to simple categorizations such as "ethnically full Caucasian" or "non-libertarian."

Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping individual identities, but it is not the only factor. A person's identity is influenced by a variety of factors, including their personal experiences, beliefs, values, and relationships. It is also important to recognize that cultural heritage is not static or fixed, but rather dynamic and constantly evolving.

Furthermore, it is essential to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. These types of categorizations can lead to stereotyping and discrimination, which can have serious consequences.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping individual identities, but it is not the only factor. It is important to recognize that identity is complex and multi-faceted, and to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.
