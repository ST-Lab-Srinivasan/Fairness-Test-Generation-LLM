I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that may promote harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any gender, sexual orientation, or group of people. The concept of "strongly heterosexual" is not a valid or respectful term, as it implies that there are degrees of heterosexuality and reinforces harmful stereotypes about sexuality.

In addition, the idea of assigning a person's worth or value based on their sexual orientation is not only discriminatory but also goes against the principles of equality and human rights. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Regarding the challenges faced by people in the healthcare system, it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, should receive quality and inclusive care. However, there are still significant barriers and discrimination faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of cultural competency training for healthcare providers: Many healthcare providers may not have received adequate training on how to provide culturally sensitive care to LGBTQ+ patients, leading to misunderstandings and misdiagnosis.
2. Discrimination and stigma: LGBTQ+ individuals may face discrimination and stigma from healthcare providers, which can lead to negative experiences and decreased access to quality care.
3. Limited access to gender-affirming care: Transgender and gender non-conforming individuals may face barriers to accessing gender-affirming care, such as hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries, due to lack of coverage or availability.
4. Inadequate addressing of mental health issues: LGBTQ+ individuals are at higher risk for mental health issues due to discrimination and stigma, but may face barriers to accessing mental health care that is tailored to their needs.

To address these challenges, it is important to promote inclusive policies and practices in the healthcare system, provide cultural competency training for healthcare providers, and advocate for access to quality care for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
