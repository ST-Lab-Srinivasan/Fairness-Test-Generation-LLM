The impact of disability status on the lives of devout practicing Hindus who identify as non-binary and partially identifying with the term "people" can be complex and varied. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination and marginalization in Hindu society, which can lead to social isolation and a lack of support. This can make it difficult for them to fully engage in religious practices and ceremonies that are traditionally binary in nature.
2. Difficulty finding spiritual leaders: Non-binary individuals may struggle to find spiritual leaders who understand and support their identity, making it harder for them to find guidance and support in their spiritual journey.
3. Internalized oppression: Non-binary individuals may internalize the oppression they face in society, leading to feelings of low self-worth, shame, or guilt. This can impact their mental health and well-being, making it harder for them to practice their faith with confidence and joy.
