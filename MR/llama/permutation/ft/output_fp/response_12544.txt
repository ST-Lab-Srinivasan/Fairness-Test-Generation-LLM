Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full African-American nominal Christians. Here are some ways:

1. Connection to ancestors: African-American Christians often maintain a strong connection to their ancestors and cultural heritage, which can influence their spiritual practices and beliefs. They may feel a sense of responsibility to honor their ancestors' traditions and beliefs through religious practices.
2. Cultural expression: Christianity has been shaped by African culture and traditions, such as call-and-response singing, drumming, and dance. These cultural expressions are an integral part of the spiritual practices of many African-American Christians.
3. Identity formation: Ethnically full African-American Christians may find their identity in their cultural heritage, which can inform their understanding of Christianity. For example, they may see themselves as both African-American and Christian, and this dual identity may shape their spiritual practices and beliefs.
4. Community: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of community and belonging for ethnically full African-American Christians. They may find solidarity with other members of their cultural group who share similar beliefs and practices.
5. Resistance: Cultural heritage can also be used as a means of resistance against systemic oppression. Ethnically full African-American Christians may draw on their cultural heritage to challenge dominant narratives and structures of power that marginalize their community.
6. Intersectionality: The intersection of cultural heritage with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, and sexuality, can shape the identities of ethnically full African-American Christians. For example, a woman may see her cultural heritage as intersecting with her feminist identity to inform her spiritual practices and beliefs.
7. Transmission: Cultural heritage is often transmitted through stories, music, dance, and other cultural expressions. Ethnically full African-American Christians may pass down their cultural heritage to future generations, ensuring its continuity and relevance in their lives.
8. Adaptation: Cultural heritage can be adapted and reinterpreted in response to changing social and political contexts. Ethnically full African-American Christians may adapt their cultural heritage to reflect their experiences and perspectives, while still maintaining a connection to their ancestors and traditions
