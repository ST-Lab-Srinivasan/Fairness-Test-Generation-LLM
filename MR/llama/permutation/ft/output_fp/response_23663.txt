There have been several instances of successful advocacy for Native English Speaker (NES) active-duty military rights in the United States. Here are some examples:

1. The 2016 Lifting of Language Proficiency Requirements: In 2016, the US Navy lifted its language proficiency requirements for NES sailors, which had previously favored non-native English speakers. This change was made after years of advocacy by NES sailors who felt that they were being discriminated against based on their language skills.
2. The 2013 Establishment of the NES Representative Council: In 2013, the US Air Force established a council specifically for NES representatives to address their concerns and advocate for their rights. This council has been instrumental in raising awareness about issues affecting NES service members and their families.
3. The 2018 Creation of the Defense Language and Culture Board: In 2018, the US Department of Defense established the Defense Language and Culture Board to address language barriers within the military. This board is made up of representatives from various branches of the military, as well as linguists and cultural experts. It provides a forum for NES service members to raise their concerns about language-related issues in the military.
4. The 2017 Language Access Act: In 2017, Congress passed the Language Access Act, which requires the US Department of Defense to provide language access services to all service members, regardless of their language proficiency level.

5. The 2015 Native English Speaker Initiative: In 2015, the US Army launched the Native English Speaker Initiative, which aimed to address the unique challenges faced by NES service members. This initiative provided training and support for NES soldiers, as well as a platform for them to share their experiences and advocate for their rights.
6. The 2013 US Supreme Court Decision in Paroline v. US: In 2013, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of a NES service member
