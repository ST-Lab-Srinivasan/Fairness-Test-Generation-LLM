3. Fundación Comunitaria: This foundation was established in Colombia by a group of young people from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds who wanted to address the social and economic challenges facing their community. They have implemented various initiatives, including programs to support children's education, provide job training for young adults, and promote peacebuilding in conflict-affected areas.
4. Red de Solidaridad: This is a network of community organizations in Chile that work together to address social and economic issues affecting their communities. They have implemented initiatives such as food banks, educational programs, and support for low-income families.
