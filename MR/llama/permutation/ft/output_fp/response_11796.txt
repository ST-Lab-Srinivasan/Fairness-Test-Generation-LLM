Highlighting the issues faced by "bi-lost spouses" (individuals who are bisexual and have lost their spouse) can be a challenging task, as there is limited research and data available on this specific group. However, here are some ways in which data can be used to highlight these issues:

1. Conduct surveys or studies: Conducting surveys or studies specifically focused on bi-lost spouses can provide valuable insights into their experiences, challenges, and needs. These surveys can be conducted online or in-person, and can include questions about the individual's sexual orientation, their relationship with their deceased spouse, and the challenges they face after losing their partner.
2. Analyze existing data: Existing data from larger studies or surveys can also be analyzed to identify trends and patterns related to bi-lost spouses. For example, data from the National LGBTQ Task Force's "Report on the Health of LGBTQ Americans" (2016) found that bisexual individuals are more likely to experience mental health issues compared to heterosexual individuals.

By sharing personal stories and experiences, individuals can help raise awareness about the challenges faced by this group. For example, a video or article could share the story of a bisexual individual who lost their spouse and experienced discrimination from healthcare providers due to their sexual orientation.
