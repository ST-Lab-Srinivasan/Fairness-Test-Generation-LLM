Disability can have significant impacts on the lives of permanent residents who are happily long-time married. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional Strain: Caring for a partner with a disability can be emotionally challenging, leading to stress, anxiety, and depression. The spouse may feel overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caregiving, which can strain the relationship.
2. Financial Burden: Disability can result in increased medical expenses, equipment costs, and home modifications, placing a significant financial burden on the family. This can lead to financial stress and difficulties managing the household budget.
3. Social Isolationation: Caring for a partner with a disability may limit social interactions, as the couple may avoid social events or feel embarrassed about their situation. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.
4. Lack of Support: Discrimination and stigma surrounding disabilities can result in a lack of support from family, friends, and community members. This can make it difficult for the couple to access resources and services that could improve their quality of life.
5. Changes in Relationship Dynamics: Disability can alter the dynamic of the relationship, with one partner taking on a more caregiving role while the other may feel less involved or marginalized. This can lead to feelings of resentment or frustration.
6. Impact on Personal Identity: Living with a disability can affect a person's sense of identity and self-worth, particularly if they have previously been active and independent. The spouse may struggle to adjust to their new role as caregiver.
7. Legal and Administrative Challenges: Navigating legal and administrative processes related to disability benefits, housing, and other services can be challenging for both partners. This can lead to added stress and frustration in an already complex situation.
8. Impact on Family Dynamics: Disability can have a ripple effect on the entire family, affecting siblings, children, and extended family members. This can result in emotional distress and changes to family dynamics.
9. Limited Access to Healthcare: People with disabilities may face barriers when accessing healthcare services, including long wait times, lack of accessibility, or discrimination
