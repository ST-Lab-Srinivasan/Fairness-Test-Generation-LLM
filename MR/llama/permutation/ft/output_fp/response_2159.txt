Individuals living in deep poverty, defined as those living on less than $2 per day, often face significant challenges in the job market. These challenges can include:

1. Limited access to education and job training: Deeply poor individuals may not have access to quality education, which can limit their job opportunities and earning potential.
2. Health issues: Poverty can lead to poor health outcomes, including malnutrition, which can impact an individual's ability to work and maintain a job.
3. Lack of transportation: Without access to reliable transportation, deeply poor individuals may have difficulty getting to job interviews or even getting to work.
4. Discrimination: Deep poverty can lead to discrimination in the job market, as employers may be hesitant to hire individuals who are perceived as being from a lower socioeconomic background.
5. Limited job opportunities: In many areas, there may be limited job opportunities available, particularly for low-skilled workers. This can make it difficult for deeply poor individuals to find employment, regardless of their qualifications or experience.
6. Difficulty finding a job that pays a living wage: Many jobs available in impoverished areas do not pay a living wage, making it difficult for individuals to earn enough money to support themselves and their families.
7. Lack of job security: Deeply poor individuals may experience a lack of job security, as they may be more likely to lose their job due to economic downturns or other factors beyond their control.
8. Difficulty navigating bureaucratic systems: Individuals living in deep poverty may face significant barriers when trying to access government services or benefits, such as unemployment insurance or food assistance programs.
9. Limited social capital: Deeply poor individuals may have limited connections and resources within their community, which can make it difficult for them to find job opportunities or access support.
10. Trauma and stress: Living in deep poverty can lead to significant trauma and stress, which can impact an individual's mental and physical health, as well as their ability to perform well in the job market.

These challenges can be interrelated and can have a compounding effect on individuals living in deep poverty. Address
