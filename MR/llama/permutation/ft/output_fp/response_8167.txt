1. Listen and validate their experiences: Start by listening to their stories, acknowledging their struggles, and validating their identity. This helps build trust and creates a safe space for them to express themselves.

8. Be mindful of language usage: Avoid using language that is offensive or alienating, and instead use inclusive terminology that acknowledges and respects their identity.
9. Encourage self-care and wellness: Support non-binary
