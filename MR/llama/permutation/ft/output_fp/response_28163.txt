Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US and long-time veterans in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, cultural backgrounds, and barriers to success. Here are some strategies that educators and policymakers can use to address these groups' specific needs:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for educators to help them understand the histories, traditions, and contemporary experiences of Native American and veteran communities. This training should include information on the social, economic, and political factors that affect these populations.
2. Inclusive Curriculum: Develop an inclusive curriculum that reflects the diverse backgrounds and experiences of Native American and veteran students. This can include incorporating Native American and military history, literature, and cultural practices into the curriculum.
3. Support Services: Provide support services specifically tailored to the needs of Native American and veteran students. This can include tutoring, mentoring, and counseling services that address the unique challenges these populations face.
4. Community Partnerships: Build partnerships with Native American and veteran organizations to provide additional resources and support for these students. These partnerships can help bridge the gap between the educational system and these communities.
5. Identity-Based Programs: Develop identity-based programs that specifically cater to the needs of Native American and veteran students. For example, a program that provides cultural enrichment activities, mentorship opportunities, and academic support specifically for Native American students can help them feel more connected and supported in their educational journey.
6. Veteran-Friendly Policies: Develop policies that are veteran-friendly, such as flexible scheduling options, credit for military service, and other forms of recognition for their service. This can help address the unique challenges faced by veterans in higher education.
7. Community Engagement: Foster community engagement and involvement in educational institutions to promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange. This can be achieved through events, workshops, and other activities that bring together students from different backgrounds.
8. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that educational facilities are accessible and inclusive for Native American and veteran students. This can include providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility,
