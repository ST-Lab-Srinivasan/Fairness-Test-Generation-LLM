Meeting the educational needs of beginner English speakers as solo students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help ensure their success. Here are some suggestions:

1. Personalized learning: Beginner English speakers may require more personalized attention and instruction than other learners. Teachers can use various teaching methods, such as one-on-one tutorials or small group classes, to tailor the learning experience to each student's needs and pace.
2. Adaptable curriculum: The curriculum should be adaptable to the individual student's level of proficiency, interests, and learning style.
