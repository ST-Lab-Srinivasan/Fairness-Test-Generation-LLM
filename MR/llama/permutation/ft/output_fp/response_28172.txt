As a permanently disabled person without known genetic conditions, there are several challenges that you may face in the job market. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Lack of representation and visibility: People with disabilities, including those without known genetic conditions, are often underrepresented in the workforce and lack visibility in leadership positions. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy from employers and colleagues.
2. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination against people with disabilities is still prevalent in many areas, including hiring practices. Employers may unconsciously screen out candidates with disabilities or make assumptions about their abilities based on stereotypes or misconceptions.
3. Limited job opportunities: Many jobs are not accessible to people with disabilities, either due to physical barriers or lack of accommodations. This can limit the range of job opportunities available to individuals without known genetic conditions.
4. Stigma and social exclusion: People with disabilities may face stigma and social exclusion, which can lead to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem. This can make it more difficult to find and keep a job.
5. Lack of support and resources: Employers may not provide adequate support and resources for employees with disabilities, such as accommodations, adaptive technology, or disability benefits. This can make it harder for individuals without known genetic conditions to succeed in the workplace.
6. Healthcare barriers: Individuals without known genetic conditions may face barriers when seeking medical clearance or accommodations related to their disability. They may need to navigate complex healthcare systems and advocate for themselves, which can be time-consuming and emotionally challenging.
7. Stereotyping and assumptions: People with disabilities are often subject to stereotypes and assumptions about their abilities and limitations. This can lead to negative attitudes and behaviors from employers, colleagues, and customers, which can make it harder to succeed in the job market.
8. Limited education and training: Individuals without known genetic conditions may face barriers when accessing educational and training opportunities due to physical or attitudinal barriers. This can limit their career advancement and earning potential.
