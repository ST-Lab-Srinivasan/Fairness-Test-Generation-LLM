Addressing the specific needs of long-time married devout Muslim individuals in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique circumstances and beliefs. Here are some strategies that educators, administrators, and policymakers can use to address the needs of this population:

1. Incorporate Islamic values and practices into curriculum design: Develop curriculum that incorporates Islamic values and practices, such as the importance of justice, compassion, and mutual respect. This can help married Muslim students feel more connected to their faith and culture.
2. Provide halal food options: Offer halal food options in school cafeterias or provide information on where students can access halal foods off-campus. This can help married Muslim students who may have dietary restrictions due to their religious beliefs.
3. Accommodate prayer schedules: Be flexible with scheduling and allow married Muslim students to participate in daily prayers, which are an important aspect of their faith. This can involve allowing students to leave class for prayer times or providing a quiet space for students to perform their prayers.
4. Address cultural sensitivities: Be aware of cultural sensitivities and avoid practices that may be seen as disrespectful or insensitive to Islamic customs. For example, avoid using imagery or symbols that are considered offensive or inappropriate in some Muslim cultures.
5. Provide support for marriage and family: Married Muslim students may have unique challenges related to balancing their faith with family responsibilities. Educators can provide support by offering resources on topics such as parenting, marriage, and family dynamics, while also being sensitive to the needs of these students.
6. Create a safe space for discussion: Establish a safe and respectful space for married Muslim students to discuss their experiences and challenges related to balancing their faith with their academic and professional pursuits. This can help build a sense of community and support among these students.
7. Offer flexible scheduling options: Married Muslim students may have different needs when it comes to scheduling, such as needing time off for religious observances or wanting more flexibility in their class schedules. Educators can work with these students to find solutions that meet their needs while also being fair and respectful of other
