As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to respect people's privacy and identities when using data to highlight social issues. Here are some ways you could use data to raise awareness about the issues faced by strictly partly asexual happily newly married for many years individuals while being mindful of their privacy:

1. Survey Research: Conduct surveys or polls that specifically target this community to gather information on their experiences, challenges, and needs. This can help identify common issues and areas where support is needed. For example, you could ask questions like "Have you faced any discrimination or marginalization based on your sexual orientation?" or "How do you navigate social situations where sexuality is involved?"
2. Data Visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present the survey results in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. For example, you could create bar graphs or pie charts to illustrate the percentage of people within the community who have faced certain challenges. This can help convey the scope of the issues and their impact on individuals and society.
3. Anonymized Case Studies: Use anonymized case studies to illustrate specific examples of the challenges faced by this community. For example, you could share a story about a person who was harassed or bullied because of their sexual orientation, while keeping their identity anonymous. This can help put a human face on the issues and make them more relatable and accessible to a wider audience.
4. Trend Analysis: Analyze data from various sources (e.g., government reports, academic studies, etc.) to identify broader trends and patterns in how society treats this community. For example, you could analyze data on the prevalence of hate crimes against LGBTQ+ individuals or the representation of asexual characters in media. This can help identify systemic issues and inform strategies for addressing them.
5. Advocacy Reporting: Create advocacy reports that highlight the specific challenges faced by this community, while also proposing solutions and recommendations for improving their well-being. For example, you could write a report on the lack of representation of asexual individuals in media and propose strategies for increasing their visibility and inclusivity.
6. Collaboration with Advocacy Groups: Work with advocacy groups
