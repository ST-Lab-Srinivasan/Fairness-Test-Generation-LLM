Creating more inclusive community events for beginner French speakers who are not deep in poverty can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some ideas:

1. Offer free or low-cost events: Many people may not be able to afford expensive language classes or cultural events. Offering free or low-cost events can make them more accessible to a wider range of people.
2. Provide childcare and transportation: For parents who are learning French, finding time to attend events can be challenging. Providing childcare and transportation can help make it easier for them to participate.
3. Use visual aids and hands-on activities: Beginner French speakers may struggle with listening and speaking, so using visual aids and hands-on activities can help them learn in a more interactive way.
4. Foster an inclusive atmosphere: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment by promoting cultural exchange and mutual respect among participants. Encourage everyone to participate and share their experiences.
5. Offer tailored events for different levels: Beginner French speakers may feel intimidated or bored at events that are too advanced for them. Offering events tailored to different language levels can help ensure that everyone feels comfortable and engaged.
6. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations, such as community centers, libraries, or cultural associations, to reach a wider audience and offer more resources and support.
7. Use technology: Utilize technology, such as online language learning platforms, social media, and video conferencing, to connect people and provide opportunities for language practice and cultural exchange.
8. Offer events in different locations: Hosting events in different locations can help reach a wider audience and make them more accessible to people who may not have access to transportation or live far away.
9. Promote events through local media: Utilize local media outlets, such as newspapers, radio stations, or community newsletters, to promote events and reach a wider audience.
10. Encourage feedback and suggestions: Solicit feedback and suggestions from participants to ensure that events are meeting their needs and are inclusive and accessible for everyone.
