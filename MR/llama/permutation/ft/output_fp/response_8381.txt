1. Improved problem-solving: When working with people from diverse backgrounds, you bring together unique skill sets, knowledge, and experiences. This can lead to more creative and innovative solutions as individuals challenge each other's assumptions and approaches (Hackman & Rah, 2018).
2. Enhanced decision-making: Group diversity has been shown to enhance decision-making accuracy by reducing the influence of groupthink and promoting critical thinking (Hackman et al., 2016). Diverse perspectives can help identify potential pitfalls or biases in decision-making processes.
3. Increased empathy and understanding: When interacting with people from different backgrounds, you are more likely to develop empathy and understanding for their experiences and viewpoints (Gaucher et al., 2015). This can lead to better communication and collaboration within teams.
4. Better representation of diverse customer bases: If you work in a customer-facing role, having employees from different backgrounds can help ensure that your organization's products or services are tailored to meet the needs of diverse customer groups (Gaucher et al., 2015).
5. Improved adaptability and resilience: When working with people from different backgrounds, you may encounter unfamiliar situations or challenges.

6. Enhanced creativity and innovation: Group diversity has been linked to increased creativity and innovation due to the collision of ideas and experiences among group members (Hackman et al., 2016).
7. Better conflict resolution: When conflicts arise, diverse perspectives can help identify underlying issues and potential solutions by bringing together different viewpoints and experiences (Gaucher et al., 2015).
8. Improved team dynamics: Interacting with people from different backgrounds can lead to better communication, collaboration, and mutual understanding among team members (Hackman & Rah,
