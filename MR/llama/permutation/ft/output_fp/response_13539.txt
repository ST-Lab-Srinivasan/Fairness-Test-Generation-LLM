Supporting the mental health of elderly female non-long-time married people can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to support their mental wellbeing:

1. Social connections: Elderly females who are not long-time married may face social isolation, which can negatively impact their mental health. Encourage them to stay connected with friends and family, and provide opportunities for social interaction through group activities or volunteering.
2. Self-care: Encourage them to engage in self-care activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as yoga, meditation, or listening to music.
3. Cognitive stimulation: Engage them in mentally stimulating activities, such as puzzles, brain teasers, or learning a new skill, to help maintain cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia.
4. Emotional support: Provide emotional support by listening to their concerns and offering words of encouragement. Encourage them to express their feelings and emotions in a safe and non-judgmental environment.
5. Physical activity: Regular physical activity can help improve mental health by reducing stress, improving mood, and promoting cognitive function. Encourage them to engage in activities they enjoy, such as walking, swimming, or gardening.
6. Access to resources: Ensure they have access to resources that promote mental wellbeing, such as counseling services, support groups, or mental health education materials.
7. Respite care: Provide respite care for elderly females who are caring for a family member or friend, to give them a break and reduce the stress of caregiving.
8. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and programs that support the mental health of elderly females, such as age-friendly communities, mental health services, and social support networks.
9. Education and awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of mental health in older adulthood and provide education on mental health issues, treatment options, and self-care strategies.
10. Cultural competence: Be culturally sensitive when providing support to elderly females from diverse backgrounds, recognizing that cultural beliefs and practices can impact mental health and wellbeing
