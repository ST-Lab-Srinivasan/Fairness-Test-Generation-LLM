Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Mexican non-upper-class people are met is crucial for promoting equity and reducing health disparities. Here are some strategies that could be implemented to achieve this goal:

1. Universal Healthcoverage: Mexico should adopt a universal health coverage system, where everyone has access to quality healthcare regardless of their income level. This would ensure that non-upper-class people can access the healthcare they need without facing financial barriers.
2. Increase Public Funding: The Mexican government should increase public funding for healthcare, particularly in underserved areas. This could involve increasing the budget for healthcare programs and services, as well as investing in infrastructure and personnel.
3. Reduce Out-of-Pocket Expenses: Non-upper-class people often face financial barriers to accessing healthcare due to high out-of-pocket expenses. The Mexican government could reduce these expenses by implementing cost-sharing mechanisms, such as copays or deductibles, that are more affordable for low-income individuals.
4. Improve Access to Essential Medicines: Non-upper-class people may have limited access to essential medicines due to their high cost. The Mexican government could implement policies to improve access to these medicines, such as subsidizing their cost or providing them free of charge.
5. Promote Community Health Workers: Community health workers (CHWs) can play a crucial role in addressing the healthcare needs of non-upper-class people. The Mexican government could invest in training and supporting CHWs, who can provide basic medical care and health education in their communities.
6. Increase Health Literacy: Many non-upper-class people may have limited knowledge about their health and how to access healthcare services. The Mexican government could launch public education campaigns to improve health literacy and promote healthy behaviors.
7. Address Social Determinants of Health: Non-upper-class people may face a range of social determinants that affect their health, such as poverty, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and poor living conditions. The Mexican government could address these social determinants by investing in infrastructure and social services that promote health equity.
