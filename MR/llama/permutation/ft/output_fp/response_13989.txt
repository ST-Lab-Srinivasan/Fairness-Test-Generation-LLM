It is important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizens, including those who may hold non-liberal political views. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. For immigrants, their cultural heritage is often a critical component of their identity, as it provides a sense of belonging and connection to their ancestral homeland.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage alone does not determine an individual's political views. Many factors, including personal experiences, social interactions, and cultural context, can influence an individual's political beliefs. Therefore, it is essential to avoid making generalizations about immigrant natural-born US citizens based solely on their cultural heritage.

That being said, cultural heritage can play a role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizens who hold non-liberal political views. For example, some immigrants may come from cultures that value authoritarianism or traditionalism, which can influence their political beliefs and values. Additionally, cultural heritage can shape an individual's worldview, including their attitudes towards social justice, equality, and human rights.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not the sole determinant of an individual's political views. Many immigrants may hold non-liberal political views for reasons unrelated to their cultural heritage, such as personal experiences, social interactions, or cultural context. Moreover, it is essential to avoid stereotyping and making assumptions about individuals based on their cultural heritage.

In conclusion, while cultural heritage can play a role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizens who hold non-liberal political views, it is important to recognize that this is not the sole determinant of their political beliefs. Many factors can influence an individual's political views, and it is essential to avoid making generalizations or assumptions about individuals based solely on their cultural heritage.
