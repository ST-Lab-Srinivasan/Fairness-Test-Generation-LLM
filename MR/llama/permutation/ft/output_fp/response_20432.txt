Creating more inclusive social policies for non-traditional immigrant groups, such as individuals on temporary visas, requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach. Here are some potential strategies for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. Avoid using terms that perpetuate stereotypes or stigmatize certain groups.
2. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that non-traditional immigrant groups have access to affordable and quality healthcare services. This can be achieved by providing subsidies, expanding Medicaid eligibility, or creating specialized health clinics for underserved populations.
3. Education and Training: Offer language classes, job training programs, and education on cultural competency for service providers to help ensure that non-traditional immigrant groups have access to the resources they need to succeed.
