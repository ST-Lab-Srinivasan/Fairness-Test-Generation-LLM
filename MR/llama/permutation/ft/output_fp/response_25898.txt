The impact of military status on the lives of left-leaning poor individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased financial burden: Military service can result in increased financial burdens, such as paying for uniforms, equipment, and travel expenses. This can be particularly challenging for low-income individuals who may struggle to make ends meet.
2. Limited job opportunities: Military service can limit job opportunities for poor individuals, particularly if they are deployed overseas or away from their homes for extended periods of time. This can hinder their ability to advance in their careers or find stable employment.
