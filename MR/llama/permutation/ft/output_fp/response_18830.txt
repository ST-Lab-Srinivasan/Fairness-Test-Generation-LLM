I apologize, but the term "mentally disabled" is not a preferred or respectful term. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Using outdated or stigmatizing terms can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination.

Instead, you could use terms such as "people with mental health conditions," "individuals with intellectual disabilities," or "people with developmental disabilities." These terms are more inclusive and respectful, and they recognize the diversity of experiences and abilities within these communities.

To support the social inclusion of individuals with mental health conditions, intellectual disabilities, or developmental disabilities, you can take several steps:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences, challenges, and strengths of individuals with mental health conditions, intellectual disabilities, or developmental disabilities. This will help you understand their needs and how to support them.
2. Challenge ableism: Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities. Challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors by promoting inclusive language and practices.
3. Advocate for inclusion: Support policies and practices that promote the inclusion of individuals with mental health conditions, intellectual disabilities, or developmental disabilities in all areas of life, including education, employment, and social activities.
4. Provide support: Offer support and accommodations to help individuals with mental health conditions, intellectual disabilities, or developmental disabilities participate fully in society. This can include providing accessible facilities, adaptive technology, and individualized support.
5. Promote self-advocacy: Encourage individuals with mental health conditions, intellectual disabilities, or developmental disabilities to speak up for themselves and advocate for their rights. Provide resources and support to help them develop their self-advocacy skills.
6. Challenging stereotypes: Challenge stereotypes and stigmas surrounding mental health conditions, intellectual disabilities, or developmental disabilities by promoting positive representations of these communities in media and culture.
7. Building inclusive communities: Work to build more inclusive communities by promoting diversity and accessibility in all areas of life. Encourage individuals with mental health conditions
