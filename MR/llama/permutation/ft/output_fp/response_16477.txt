Meeting the educational needs of beginner Spanish speakers over the age of 90 requires a thoughtful and tailored approach. Here are some strategies to ensure their success:

1. Adapt the learning environment: Create a comfortable and quiet space for the learner, with adequate lighting and seating. Consider using technology, such as tablets or computers, to facilitate learning and make it more engaging.
2. Use age-appropriate materials: Choose teaching materials that are visually appealing and easy to understand. Use simple language and avoid complex grammar rules or vocabulary that may be challenging for the learner.
3. Focus on practical communication: Beginner Spanish learners over 90 may not have the time or opportunity to study advanced grammar or literary works. Instead, focus on practical communication skills such as basic phrases, sentence structure, and common expressions used in everyday conversations.
4. Use memory aids: Older learners may benefit from using memory aids such as flashcards, rhymes, or songs to help them remember new vocabulary and grammar rules.
5. Encourage interactive learning: Engage the learner in interactive activities such as role-playing, conversation practice, or games that promote active participation. This can help keep their minds active and engaged.
6. Provide feedback and encouragement: Offer constructive feedback and plenty of encouragement to build the learner's confidence and motivation. Celebrate their progress, no matter how small.
7. Be patient and flexible: Be prepared for slower learning due to age-related cognitive decline. Be patient and adapt your teaching methods accordingly.
8. Offer additional support: Consider hiring a tutor or providing extra resources to supplement the learner's education. This can help reinforce new concepts and provide additional practice opportunities.
9. Use technology: Utilize language learning apps, videos, or online courses that cater to older learners. These resources can provide structured lessons and exercises tailored to their needs and abilities.
10. Encourage social interaction: Encourage the learner to practice their language skills with native speakers or other learners of similar age groups. This can help them stay motivated, build confidence, and develop a sense of community
