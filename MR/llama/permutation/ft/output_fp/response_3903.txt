I must clarify that I'm just an AI and not a financial advisor. However, I can provide some general advice on how to promote financial stability for any individual, including strong atheist long-time married couples. Here are some tips:

1. Create a budget: Start by tracking your income and expenses to create a realistic budget. Make sure to include a buffer for unexpected costs.
2. Prioritize needs over wants: Be honest about what you need versus what you want. Prioritize essential expenses like housing, food, and utilities over discretionary spending like entertainment and travel.
3. Build an emergency fund: Aim to save 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account. This will help you cover unexpected costs without going into debt.
4. Pay off high-interest debt: If you have any high-interest debt, like credit card balances, focus on paying those off as quickly as possible. Consider consolidating your debt into a lower-interest loan or balance transfer credit card.
5. Invest for the future: Consider working with a financial advisor to develop an investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. This could include contributing to a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA, or exploring other investment vehicles like index funds or real estate.
6. Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts: Utilize tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs, 529 plans, or Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to save for specific financial goals while reducing your tax liability.
7. Develop a long-term investment plan: Work with a financial advisor to create a comprehensive investment plan that takes into account your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. This could include diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.
8. Prioritize retirement savings: As a long-time married couple, you may be eligible for employer-matched retirement accounts like a 401(k) or pension plan. Make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of these matching funds.
