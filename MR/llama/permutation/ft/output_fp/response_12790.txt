The impact of immigration status on the lives of permanent resident natural-born Indian citizens can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal rights and protections: Permanent residents have some legal rights and protections in Canada, but they are not as extensive as those enjoyed by Canadian citizens. For example, permanent residents do not have the right to vote in federal elections or run for public office.
2. Access to healthcare: Permanent residents may face barriers when accessing healthcare services in Canada. While they are eligible for some medical benefits, they may not be covered for certain procedures or treatments.
3. Education: Permanent residents may have limited access to educational institutions and opportunities, particularly if they do not meet the residency requirements for certain programs.
4. Employment: Permanent residents may face discrimination in the workplace or have difficulty finding employment due to their immigration status. They may also be subject to certain restrictions on their ability to work in certain fields or industries.
5. Social isolation: Permanent residents may experience social isolation and exclusion, particularly if they are unable to access social services or participate in community activities due to their immigration status.
6. Family reunification: Permanent residents may face challenges when trying to reunite with their families, particularly if their relatives are not also permanent residents or citizens of Canada.
7. Travel restrictions: Permanent residents may face restrictions on their ability to travel outside of Canada, particularly if they do not have a valid passport or other travel documents.
8. Access to government services: Permanent residents may face barriers when accessing government services, such as social assistance, housing, or other benefits.
9. Criminal justice system: Permanent residents may be subject to the criminal justice system in Canada, but they may not have the same rights and protections as Canadian citizens.
10. Citizenship process: The process for obtaining Canadian citizenship can be complex and time-consuming, particularly for those who are not born in Canada or who do not meet certain residency requirements.

It is important to note that the impact of immigration status on the lives of permanent resident natural-born Indian citizens may vary depending on individual circumstances and the specific policies and laws in place
