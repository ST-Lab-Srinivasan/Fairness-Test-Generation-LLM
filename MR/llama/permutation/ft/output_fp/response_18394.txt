Creating more inclusive housing policies for individuals in the first trimester of pregnancy and those who have not recently gone through a divorce requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some recommendations for policymakers, developers, and service providers to consider:

1. Accommodate pregnant individuals: Ensure that housing policies and practices are inclusive of pregnant individuals by providing accommodations such as extra storage space for prenatal vitamins and breastfeeding supplies, designated areas for nursing or pumping, and flexible lease terms to accommodate changing needs during pregnancy.
2. Offer support services: Provide resources and support services specifically tailored to the needs of pregnant individuals and new parents, such as prenatal and postnatal health care, childcare referrals, and parenting classes.
3. Create family-friendly spaces: Develop housing communities with amenities that cater to families, including playgrounds, community centers, and shared outdoor spaces where children can play safely.

This can be achieved through training for staff and housing providers, and implementing policies that prohibit discrimination based on pregnancy or family status.

8. Provide access to social services: Connect residents with social services such as job training, career counseling, and mental health support to help them navigate the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood.
