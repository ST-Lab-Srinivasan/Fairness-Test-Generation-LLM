Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US, who are happily married and have been in the country for many years, requires a nuanced approach that considers their unique cultural background, language barriers, and socio-economic challenges. Here are some strategies that education providers can adopt to support these individuals:

1. Culturally responsive teaching practices: Native American educators can benefit from culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge the importance of their cultural background in shaping their learning experiences.
