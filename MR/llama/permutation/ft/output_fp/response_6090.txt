It is important to recognize that the healthcare needs of marginalized communities, including those in Mexico, are often neglected or poorly addressed. To ensure that the healthcare needs of Mexican non-lower-class people are met, it is crucial to adopt a comprehensive and inclusive approach that addresses the social determinants of health and prioritizes equity and accessibility.
