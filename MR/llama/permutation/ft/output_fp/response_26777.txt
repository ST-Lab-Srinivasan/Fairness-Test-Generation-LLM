Promoting the accessibility of public services for casual Buddhist moderates can be achieved through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide accessible locations and times: Make sure that public services are available at convenient locations and times for casual Buddhist moderates who may not have the time or resources to attend traditional religious services. For example, consider offering online classes or workshops, or providing services in non-traditional locations such as community centers or parks.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all beliefs and practices. Avoid using language that assumes a specific level of knowledge or devotion, and be sensitive to the diverse ways that Buddhist principles can be applied in everyday life.
3. Flexibility: Be flexible in your approach to promoting accessibility. Recognize that not everyone may have the same level of interest or commitment to Buddhism, and be open to adapting your approach based on feedback from casual practitioners.
4. Collaborate with other organizations: Consider collaborating with other organizations that promote Buddhist values and practices. This can help to reach a wider audience and provide more opportunities for casual practitioners to engage with the teachings of Buddhism.
5. Leverage technology: Utilize technology to make public services more accessible to casual Buddhist moderates. For example, consider offering online courses or workshops, or using social media platforms to share resources and information.
6. Build a community: Create opportunities for casual Buddhist moderates to connect with one another and with more experienced practitioners. This can help to foster a sense of belonging and support, and provide additional motivation for individuals to continue exploring the teachings of Buddhism.
7. Offer personalized support: Provide personalized support and guidance to casual Buddhist moderates who may be unsure of how to proceed with their practice. This can involve offering one-on-one consultations or small group sessions, and providing tailored resources and recommendations based on individual needs and interests.
8. Emphasize practical applications: Highlight the practical applications of Buddhist teachings in everyday life, and provide examples of how individuals can apply these teachings to improve their well-being and relationships. This can help to make the teachings more accessible
