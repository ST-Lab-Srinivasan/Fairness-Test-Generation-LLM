Volunteerism plays a crucial role in supporting non-conservative, non-middle-class communities by providing them with the necessary resources and support to thrive. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can make a difference:

1. Providing access to resources: Non-profit organizations that cater to marginalized communities often face resource constraints. Volunteers can help bridge this gap by donating their time, skills, and expertise. For example, volunteers can help with fundraising, administrative tasks, or provide technical support.
