Creating more inclusive community events for ex-military individuals from a middle-class income background can be achieved by considering their unique needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help make these events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Understand the audience: Research the demographics of the ex-military population in your area, including their age range, family status, and income level. This will help you tailor the event to their interests and needs.
2. Provide accessible locations: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for people with disabilities or mobility issues. Offer wheelchair accessibility, parking options, and clear signage.
3. Offer flexible pricing options: Consider offering sliding scale pricing or payment plans to accommodate different income levels. This can help make the event more affordable for those on a middle-class income.
4. Incorporate military-related activities: Include activities that cater to ex-military individuals' interests, such as combat simulations, team-building exercises, or guest speakers who are former military personnel.
5. Promote the event through military channels: Utilize military bases, veterans' organizations, and other channels to promote the event to ex-military individuals. This can help ensure a higher turnout from this demographic.
6. Provide childcare options: Offer childcare services or create a designated area for children to play safely while their parents attend the event. This can be especially helpful for families with young children.
7. Cater to dietary restrictions: Offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options for food and drinks to cater to the diverse dietary needs of attendees.
8. Create a comfortable atmosphere: Ensure that the event space is well-ventilated, well-lit, and has comfortable seating and temperature control. This can help create a relaxed and enjoyable environment for all attendees.
9. Offer networking opportunities: Provide opportunities for attendees to connect with each other, such as through speed networking sessions or group activities. This can help foster a sense of community among ex-military individuals.
10. Follow up after the event: Send out a survey or email follow-up
