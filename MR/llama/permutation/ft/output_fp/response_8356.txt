Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and well-being of ethnically full Asian individuals over the age of 90, particularly those who are over 85. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to their growth and development:

1. Emotional Support: Older adults may experience social isolation, loneliness, or depression, which can negatively impact their mental health. Mentorship can provide emotional support and companionship, helping them feel less lonely and more connected to society.
2. Preservation of Cultural Identity: As Asian individuals age, they may face challenges in preserving their cultural identity, especially if they are living in a non-Asian dominant culture.

3. Networking Opportunities: A mentor can provide opportunities for social interaction and networking, which can help older adults stay connected to their community and feel more engaged in society. This is particularly important for those who may have limited mobility or social connections due to age-related health issues.
