Creating more inclusive social policies for devout practicing Hindu post-transition early-transition transgender individuals requires a deep understanding of their experiences, challenges, and needs. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of Transgender individuals in Hinduism: The first step is to recognize that transgender individuals exist within the Hindu community. Many Hindu texts and scriptures have references to people who identify as LGBTQ+, and these individuals are not mutually exclusive from the broader Hindu community.
2. Use inclusive language: Use language that includes and respects the identities of transgender individuals. Avoid using gendered terms or making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
3. Provide access to gender-affirming healthcare: Ensure that transgender individuals have access to gender-affirming healthcare, including hormone replacement therapy and gender-affirming surgeries. This can help alleviate mental health issues and improve overall well-being.
4. Create safe spaces for transitioning: Create safe and inclusive spaces for transgender individuals to transition without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can include access to gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, and other spaces that are free from gender-based violence.
5. Address intersectionality: Recognize that transgender individuals may face additional barriers due to their race, class, sexuality, or other aspects of their identity. Address these intersections of oppression by incorporating a critical race and queer theory lens into policy creation.
6. Engage with the community: Consult with transgender individuals and organizations to ensure that policies are inclusive and meet their needs. This can involve conducting focus groups, surveys, or other forms of participatory research.
7. Provide education and training: Offer education and training on issues related to gender identity, diversity, and inclusion for community members, healthcare providers, and educators. This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce discrimination.
8. Address legal barriers: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, or national level that address legal barriers to healthcare access, employment discrimination, and other forms of marginalization
