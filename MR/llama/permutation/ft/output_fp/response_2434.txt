As an NLP model, I cannot directly interact with individuals or provide personalized language learning experiences. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to ensure that the educational needs of active-duty beginner Arabic speakers are met:

1. Assess their level and interests: Before creating any language learning program, it's essential to assess the learners' current level of proficiency in Arabic and their areas of interest. This will help tailor the content to meet their specific needs and goals.
2. Offer a variety of learning resources: Provide access to a range of learning materials, including textbooks, audio/video recordings, language learning apps, and online courses. This will cater to different learning styles and preferences.
3. Develop a structured course curriculum: Design a comprehensive course curriculum that covers all aspects of Arabic language learning, such as grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing, and speaking. Include interactive activities, quizzes, and assessments to evaluate progress.
4. Use authentic materials: Utilize real-life materials like news articles, videos, podcasts, and songs to expose learners to natural language use. This will help them develop a better understanding of how Arabic is used in practical situations.
5. Encourage self-directed learning: Encourage learners to take ownership of their language learning journey by providing access to online resources, language learning apps, and other tools that can be used for self-study.
6. Offer language immersion opportunities: Arrange language immersion programs or exchanges with native Arabic speakers to provide learners with an authentic language learning experience. This will help them develop a deeper understanding of the culture and nuances of the language.
7. Provide feedback and support: Assign a tutor or language coach to provide individualized feedback and support throughout the learning process. This will help learners identify areas for improvement and stay motivated.
8. Use technology-based tools: Utilize digital tools like language learning apps, online courses, and virtual reality environments to enhance the learning experience. These tools can provide interactive and immersive language learning experiences that simulate real-life situations.
9. Encourage peer learning: Create opportunities for learners to interact with each other and practice speaking in Arabic. This
