Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly those in the third trimester of pregnancy who are not widows for an extended period. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during pregnancy, including lack of access to prenatal care, delayed or missed diagnoses, and fear of deportation. This can lead to poor maternal and fetal health outcomes.
2. Prenatal Care: Limited access to prenatal care can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Immigrant women may also face language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers.
3. Birthplace and Citizenship: The birthplace of a child can have significant legal implications for both the mother and the child. Undocumented immigrants may give birth in a hospital or clinic without access to birthing facilities, which can result in complications during delivery. Additionally, children born to undocumented immigrants may face challenges obtaining U.S. citizenship.
4. Family Separation: Immigrant women who are detained or deported during pregnancy may be separated from their spouses or partners, leading to emotional distress and instability for both parents and children.
5. Economic Stress: Pregnant immigrants may face economic challenges due to lack of access to healthcare, employment, or financial resources. This can lead to food insecurity, housing insecurity, and other adverse outcomes for the mother and child.
6. Social Isolationation: Immigrant women may experience social isolation during pregnancy, particularly if they are undocumented and fearful of seeking help from healthcare providers or social services. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression.
7. Lack of Knowledge about Resources: Undocumented immigrants may be unaware of available resources for pregnant women, such as prenatal care, birthing classes, and postpartum support. This lack of knowledge can lead to poor health outcomes for both the mother and child.
8. Fear of Law Enforcement:
