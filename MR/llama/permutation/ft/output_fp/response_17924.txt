Ensuring the educational needs of beginner English speakers who are newly married and enrolling in an education institution can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be employed to meet their unique requirements:

1. Identify their needs: Conduct a needs assessment to identify the language proficiency level, learning style, and other factors that may impact their ability to learn English. This will help educators tailor their teaching methods and materials to meet the individuals' specific needs.
2. Provide accessible resources: Offer a range of learning materials and resources that cater to different learning styles and abilities.
