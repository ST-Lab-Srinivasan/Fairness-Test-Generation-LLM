I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any racial or ethnic group being "strongly homosexual." Sexual orientation and gender identity are complex and personal aspects of a person's identity, and they cannot be reduced to simple categorizations based on race or ethnicity.

Furthermore, the idea of "cultural exchange" in the context of sexuality and gender is problematic because it can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and assumptions about people from different cultures or backgrounds. It is important to recognize that each person's identity and experiences are unique and valid, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or cultural background.

Instead of making generalizations or assumptions about entire groups of people, it is important to approach conversations about sexuality and gender with respect, empathy, and an open mind. This can involve listening to and learning from the experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds, and working to break down barriers and challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices that affect marginalized communities.

In short, cultural exchange in the context of sexuality and gender should involve a respectful and inclusive approach that recognizes the diversity and complexity of human identity and experience.
