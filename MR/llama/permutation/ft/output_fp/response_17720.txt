As a recent immigrant to the US, beginning Chinese speakers may face several challenges when navigating the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they might encounter:

1. Language barriers: Limited proficiency in English can make it difficult for beginners to communicate effectively with healthcare providers, understand medical procedures and treatments, and read and fill out medical forms.
2. Cultural differences: China and the US have different cultures, values, and beliefs regarding healthcare. Beginners may find it challenging to adapt to these differences, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.

4. Different medical practices: China and the US have different approaches to healthcare, including differences in prescription medications, medical procedures, and patient-provider interactions. Beginners might find it challenging to adapt to these differences.
