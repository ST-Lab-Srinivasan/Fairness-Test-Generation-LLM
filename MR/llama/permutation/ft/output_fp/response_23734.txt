Ensuring that the healthcare needs of recent immigrants, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, are met in the United States requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Expand Medicaid eligibility: Many recent immigrants, particularly those from lower-income families, may not have access to healthcare due to lack of insurance or unaffordable premiums. Expanding Medicaid eligibility to include these individuals can help bridge the gap in healthcare coverage.
