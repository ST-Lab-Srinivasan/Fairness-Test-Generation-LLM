As a linguist and interpreter, I can provide you with some general insights on the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers and beginner English speakers in the legal system. Keep in mind that these challenges may vary depending on the specific context and location.

1. Language barriers: The primary challenge for both beginner Arabic and English speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be difficult to understand, especially when navigating complex legal procedures and documents.
2. Cultural differences: Arabic and English cultures have distinct norms, values, and customs.
