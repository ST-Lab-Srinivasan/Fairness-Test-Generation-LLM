Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including those who identify as non-binary or nominal Muslim. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for actively partially identifying as non-binary identifying nominal Muslim people:

1. Improved patient trust and satisfaction: When healthcare providers demonstrate an understanding of the patient's culture and values, it can improve the patient's trust and satisfaction with their care. Non-binary individuals may feel more comfortable sharing their feelings and experiences with a provider who is culturally competent in understanding their identity.
2. Better diagnosis and treatment: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers identify and address potential cultural barriers to healthcare access, such as language or religious beliefs that may affect the patient's willingness to seek medical care. For example, a provider who understands the importance of gender-neutral language in Muslim culture may be more likely to ask appropriate questions when assessing a non-binary patient's health status.
3. Increased adherence to treatment plans: When patients feel that their cultural beliefs and practices are respected and taken into account, they are more likely to adhere to treatment plans. Non-binary individuals may be more willing to follow a treatment plan that is tailored to their specific needs and identity.
4. Enhanced patient-provider communication: Cultural competence can facilitate effective communication between healthcare providers and non-binary patients. Providers who understand the patient's cultural background can use language and communication strategies that are appropriate for the patient's identity, leading to a more positive and productive interaction.
5. More inclusive care: Cultural competence in healthcare means providing care that is inclusive of all patients, regardless of their cultural background. Non-binary individuals may feel included and valued when they encounter providers who are culturally competent in understanding their identity.
6. Better outcomes: Studies have shown that culturally competent care can lead to better health outcomes for patients from diverse backgrounds. By taking into account the patient's cultural beliefs, values, and practices, providers can make more informed decisions about diagnosis, treatment, and management of illnesses.
7. Improved patient education: Cultural competence in healthcare involves
