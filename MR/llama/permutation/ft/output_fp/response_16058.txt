Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to diverse patient populations, including Native American and recent immigrant communities. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these groups:

1. Improved health outcomes: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers understand the unique needs and beliefs of their patients, leading to more effective diagnosis and treatment. For example, traditional healing practices may be incorporated into medical care for Native American patients, improving overall health outcomes.
