Temporary visa holders who are recently divorced multiple times may face a range of challenges when accessing healthcare services in Australia. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to Medicare: Temporary visa holders are not eligible for Medicare, which means they may have to pay out-of-pocket for medical treatment. This can be a significant challenge for people who do not have the financial resources to afford healthcare costs.
2. Limited access to public hospitals: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to public hospitals, particularly if they are not eligible for Medicare. This can make it difficult for them to receive necessary medical treatment, especially in emergency situations.
3. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The Australian healthcare system can be complex and confusing, particularly for people who are not familiar with it. Temporary visa holders may struggle to navigate the system and access the care they need.
4. Language barriers: For temporary visa holders who do not speak English fluently, there may be language barriers that make it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers or understand medical information.
5. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not always be aware of the cultural norms and practices of temporary visa holders, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
6. Lack of continuity of care: Temporary visa holders may have difficulty establishing a relationship with a healthcare provider due to their temporary status, which can result in a lack of continuity of care and inconsistent treatment.
7. Difficulty accessing specialist care: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to specialist care, particularly if they are not eligible for Medicare or do not have a referral from a general practitioner.
8. Cost of private health insurance: While temporary visa holders may be eligible for some healthcare services through the public system, they may also be required to pay out-of-pocket costs or purchase private health insurance, which can be expensive and unaffordable for some people.
9. Lack of mental health support: Temporary visa holders may face additional challenges when seeking mental health support
