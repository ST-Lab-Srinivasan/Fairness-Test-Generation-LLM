The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of older adult average earners can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial strain: Genetic conditions can lead to increased healthcare costs, including medical expenses, lost income due to missed workdays, and reduced productivity. Older adults who are average earners may struggle to manage these costs, especially if they do not have adequate health insurance or savings.
