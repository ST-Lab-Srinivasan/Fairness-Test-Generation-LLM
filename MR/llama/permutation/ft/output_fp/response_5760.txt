Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-native speakers, including those who are beginning to learn Chinese. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can impact the identity formation of beginners:

1. Cultural background: A person's cultural background influences their language learning process and the way they perceive the language. For example, a beginner who comes from a collectivist culture (such as China) may prioritize group harmony over individualism, which can affect their communication style and language usage.
2. Identity formation: Beginners' identities are shaped by their exposure to Chinese culture, history, and values. They may adopt certain aspects of Chinese culture, such as Confucianism or Taoism, and incorporate them into their identity. This can also influence their language learning journey, as they may feel more motivated to learn a language that is associated with their cultural heritage.
3. Intersectionality: A beginner's cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of their identity, such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. For example, a beginner who identifies as a woman of color may face unique challenges in the language learning process due to systemic barriers and biases.
4. Power dynamics: The power dynamics between the learner and the language can also be influenced by cultural heritage. For instance, a beginner from a post-colonial context may feel more empowered to learn a language that was once imposed upon their culture, challenging the dominant power structure.
5. Stereotypes and prejudices: Beginners may encounter stereotypes or prejudices based on their cultural heritage, which can affect their motivation and self-efficacy in learning Chinese. For example, a beginner from East Asia may face stereotypes that they are not capable of learning tones, while a beginner from West Africa may face prejudices due to negative associations with their native language.
6. Language ideology: Beginners' cultural heritage can shape their perceptions of the Chinese language and its associated linguistic and cultural norms. For example, a beginner who values directness and straightforwardness in communication may find it challenging to adapt to the more indirect and nuanced nature of Chinese language.
