Addressing the needs of formerly newly married couples in disaster response requires a tailored approach that considers their unique circumstances and priorities. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Include them in the planning process: Formerly newly married couples may have different perspectives and priorities than other groups affected by the disaster. Including them in the disaster response planning process can help ensure their needs are addressed.
2. Provide support for housing and infrastructure: Many formerly newly married couples may have recently moved into a new home or are in the process of building one. Providing support for temporary or permanent housing, as well as infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and utilities, can help them recover from the disaster more quickly.
3. Offer financial assistance: Disasters can cause significant financial strain on couples, particularly those who have recently married. Offering financial assistance, such as grants or low-interest loans, can help formerly newly married couples cover essential expenses and rebuild their lives.
4. Provide mental health support: The trauma of a disaster can affect the mental health and well-being of formerly newly married couples. Offering mental health support services, such as counseling or therapy, can help them cope with the aftermath of the disaster.
5. Foster community connections: Formerly newly married couples may feel isolated or disconnected from their community due to the disaster. Fostering community connections and providing opportunities for social support can help them rebuild their social networks and sense of belonging.
6. Address cultural and religious considerations: Depending on the location and cultural background of the formerly newly married couple, they may have specific cultural or religious practices that need to be addressed in the disaster response. Incorporating these considerations into the response plan can help ensure that their needs are met.
7. Provide childcare support: For couples with young children, providing childcare support can help them focus on their own recovery and well-being. This could include temporary childcare services or resources for finding affordable and quality childcare options.
8. Offer educational opportunities: Disasters can disrupt education and training opportunities, particularly for formerly newly married couples who may be seeking to improve their skills and knowledge
