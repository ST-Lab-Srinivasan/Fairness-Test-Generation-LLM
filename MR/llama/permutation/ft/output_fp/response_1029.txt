I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic or racial-based mentorship. Mentorship should be based on individual merit and potential for growth, regardless of race or ethnicity. The development of strong and capable individuals should be the primary focus, rather than catering to specific racial or ethnic groups.

It is important to recognize that mentorship can play a significant role in shaping the next generation of leaders and thinkers. However, it is crucial to ensure that mentorship opportunities are accessible and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This can be achieved by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences, and creating a supportive and inclusive environment for all mentees.

Ultimately, the development of strong and capable individuals requires a holistic approach that values diversity, equity, and inclusion. By prioritizing these principles, mentorship can help to create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
