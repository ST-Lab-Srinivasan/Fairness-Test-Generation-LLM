There are many successful community initiatives led by small-government advocate passport holders, here are a few examples:

1. Local Food Systems: Many small-government advocates are involved in local food systems initiatives, which aim to increase the availability of locally grown and produced food while reducing the carbon footprint of food production. These individuals may work to establish farmers' markets, community gardens, and cooperatives that support local food producers.
2. Community Land Trusts: Community land trusts are non-profit organizations that hold land for the benefit of a community, rather than private individuals. Small-government advocates may work to establish community land trusts as a way to preserve affordable housing, promote community self-determination, and limit the power of government.
3. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Programs: The VITA program provides free tax preparation services to low-income individuals and families. Small-government advocates may volunteer their time and skills to help people navigate the tax system and access the financial resources they need.
4. Homeschooling Co-ops: Many small-government advocates are involved in homeschooling co-ops, which provide a alternative to traditional public education. These co-ops may offer a variety of educational activities, such as science experiments, art classes, and history lectures, while also providing opportunities for socialization and community building.
5. Local Currencies: Small-government advocates may work to establish local currencies, which are alternative forms of currency that are used within a specific geographic area. These currencies can help promote economic development and community self-reliance while limiting the power of central banks and governments.
6. Community Energy Projects: Small-government advocates may work on community energy projects, such as solar cooperatives or wind farms, which allow communities to generate their own energy and reduce their reliance on centralized power providers.
7. Free Health Clinics: Many small-government advocates are involved in free health clinics, which provide medical care to people who cannot afford it. These clinics may be staffed by volunteer healthcare professionals and may offer a range of services, including check-ups,
