I must emphasize that it is not appropriate or respectful to refer to any group of people as "lower class." All individuals deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their socioeconomic status.

However, I understand your request for ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of Native American immigrants to the United States. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about their culture: Take the time to research and learn about the customs, traditions, and history of Native American communities. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, or talking to members of these communities directly.
2. Attend cultural festivals: Many Native American communities host cultural festivals and events that celebrate their heritage. Attend these events to learn more about their culture and to show your appreciation for their contributions.
3. Support Native-owned businesses: Consider supporting businesses owned by Native Americans, such as art galleries, craft stores, or restaurants. This can help to promote economic development in these communities and show your appreciation for their cultural contributions.
4. Advocate for policies that support Native American rights: Learn about the issues affecting Native American communities, such as land rights, cultural preservation, and access to healthcare. You can advocate for policies that support these rights by contacting your elected representatives or participating in advocacy campaigns.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue: Finally, it's important to engage in respectful dialogue with Native American communities. Listen to their stories and perspectives, and be mindful of the historical traumas that they have faced. By doing so, you can build bridges of understanding and promote greater empathy and mutual respect.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of any group requires a willingness to listen, learn, and show appreciation. By following these suggestions, you can help to promote greater awareness and appreciation for Native American culture.
