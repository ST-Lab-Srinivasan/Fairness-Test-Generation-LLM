Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American and recent immigrant individuals in the US, including hardcore libertarians. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, traditions, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society. For Native Americans and recent immigrants, their cultural heritage is often closely tied to their ethnic identity and sense of belonging.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of these groups:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and connection to one's community and history.

For example, many Native American tribes have traditional ceremonies and rituals that are an important part of their cultural heritage, and these practices help to define their identity and sense of community.

For example, many Native American tribes have a strong emphasis on community and collectivism, which is reflected in their cultural heritage. Similarly, recent immigrants may bring with them a set of values and beliefs that are centered around their own cultural heritage, such as the importance of family and community.
4. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can play a role in shaping an individual's identity, particularly during times of change or transition. For example, recent immigrants may feel a sense of disconnection from their home culture and identity when they arrive in the US, but as they become more established in their new community, their cultural heritage can help them form a sense of identity and belonging.
5. Resistance and activism: Cultural heritage can also be a source of resistance and activism for marginalized groups. For example, Native
