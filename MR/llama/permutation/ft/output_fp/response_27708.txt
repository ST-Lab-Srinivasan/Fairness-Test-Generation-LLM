Creating more inclusive social policies for lifelong, recently single, long-term, and long-term undocumented individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these populations. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Listen to the voices of marginalized communities: It is essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of lifelong, recently single, long-term, and long-term undocumented individuals. This involves engaging in dialogue with these populations, gathering data and feedback through surveys, focus groups, and other methods, and using this information to inform policy decisions.
2. Acknowledge the intersectionality of identities: Lifelong, recently single, long-term, and long-term undocumented individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination and marginalization based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ability, and immigration status. Policies must take into account the intersectionality of these identities and address the specific challenges faced by each group.
3. Address systemic barriers: Lifelong, recently single, long-term, and long-term undocumented individuals often face systemic barriers to accessing basic rights and services, such as healthcare, education, and employment. Policies must aim to dismantle these barriers by promoting access and inclusivity.
4. Provide a safety net: Lifelong, recently single, long-term, and long-term undocumented individuals may be more vulnerable to poverty, homelessness, and other forms of social exclusion. Policies should aim to provide a safety net through programs such as affordable housing, food assistance, and job training.
5. Promote cultural humility: Cultural humility involves recognizing and respecting the diversity of experiences and perspectives within marginalized communities. Policymakers must strive to understand and appreciate the cultural practices, values, and beliefs of lifelong, recently single, long-term, and long-term undocumented individuals.
6. Address language barriers: Many lifelong, recently single, long-term, and long-term undocumented individuals may face language barriers that hinder their access to services and opportunities
