Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty blue-collar people requires understanding their needs and preferences, as well as addressing the challenges they face. Here are some suggestions to make your community events more inclusive:

1. Identify their interests: Research the hobbies and interests of active-duty blue-collar individuals to tailor your events accordingly. For example, you could host a car show or a DIY workshop for those who enjoy working on vehicles or crafting.
2. Offer flexible scheduling: Many active-duty blue-collar individuals have busy schedules and may struggle to attend events during traditional weekday hours. Consider hosting events on weekends or evenings when they are more likely to be available.
3. Provide childcare options: Military families often have limited access to childcare, making it challenging for parents to participate in community events. Offer on-site childcare or provide information about local resources that can help with this challenge.
