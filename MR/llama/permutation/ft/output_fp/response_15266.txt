As a responsible AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "Native" is a complex and problematic label, as it can be seen as reducing the identity of Indigenous peoples to their ancestral heritage alone. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of Native American identities and experiences, and to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or essentialisms.

That being said, there are a number of challenges faced by moderate Native natural-born US citizens in the healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to culturally competent care: Many Native Americans face barriers when trying to access healthcare that is culturally sensitive and responsive to their needs. This can include a lack of providers who are knowledgeable about Native American culture and practices, as well as language barriers.
2. Health disparities: Native Americans experience significant health disparities compared to the general US population, including higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions. These disparities are often linked to historical trauma, poverty, and lack of access to healthy food and exercise opportunities.
3. Lack of representation in healthcare policy: Native Americans are underrepresented in policy-making positions, which can result in a lack of consideration for their needs and perspectives in healthcare policies and initiatives.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Native Americans may experience stigma and discrimination within the healthcare system, which can affect their ability to access care and feel comfortable seeking help when needed.
5. Limited availability of specialized care: Native Americans may face challenges accessing specialized care, such as mental health services or cancer treatment, due to a lack of providers in their area who are knowledgeable about their specific needs.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The complexities of the US healthcare system can be overwhelming for any patient, but especially for those from marginalized communities who may face additional barriers.
7. Limited access to telehealth services: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas with limited internet access or infrastructure, making it difficult for them to access telehealth services.
8. Limited availability of culturally sensitive health education materials: Many health education materials are not culturally sensitive
