Supporting the economic empowerment of poor Native natural-born US citizen individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the historical and systemic barriers that have hindered their economic progress. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Job Training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that equip individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and college scholarships.
2. Microfinance and Entrepreneurship Support: Offer microloans, financial literacy programs, and entrepreneurship support to help individuals start or grow their own businesses. This can help create jobs and generate income for the individual and their community.
3. Land Access and Ownership: Address the historical injustices of land dispossession by providing access to affordable land and supporting the development of community-owned agricultural projects. This can help individuals and families secure a stable source of food and income.
4. Healthcare and Mental Health Services: Ensure access to quality healthcare and mental health services, including substance abuse treatment and counseling. This can help address the unique health challenges faced by Native communities and improve overall well-being.
5. Community Development and Capacity Building: Invest in community development initiatives that support the growth and sustainability of Native communities. This can include infrastructure development, cultural preservation, and capacity building programs for community leaders.
6. Economic Development Corporations: Establish economic development corporations (EDCs) to provide financial and technical assistance to Native-owned businesses. EDCs can help entrepreneurs access capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities to scale their businesses and create jobs.
7. Tax Incentives and Policy Reforms: Advocate for tax incentives and policy reforms that support the economic development of Native communities. This can include preferential tax treatment for Native-owned businesses, as well as policies that promote tribal sovereignty and self-determination.
8. Partnerships with Mainstream Organizations: Foster partnerships between Native American communities and mainstream organizations to leverage resources and expertise. This can help address the systemic barriers that have hindered economic progress in Native communities
