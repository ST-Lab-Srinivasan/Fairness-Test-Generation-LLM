Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal beginner French speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach to design, planning, and management. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Offer multilingual signage and wayfinding: Provide clear and concise signs in multiple languages, including the local language and other languages spoken by the community, such as Arabic, Chinese, or Spanish. This will help non-French speakers navigate public spaces more easily.
2. Use visual aids and pictures: Incorporate pictures and graphics into signage and wayfinding to help non-French speakers understand the information being conveyed. For example, using pictures of objects or landmarks can help individuals identify their location.
3. Provide audio announcements: Install audio announcement systems in public spaces, such as train stations or airports, that provide information in multiple languages. This can include announcements about delays, schedules, and directions to different areas of the space.
4. Train staff: Ensure that staff members are trained in customer service and communication with non-French speakers. Provide them with resources and support to help them interact effectively with individuals who may not speak French.
5. Create multilingual materials: Develop marketing materials, maps, and other resources that are available in multiple languages. This can help individuals who may not speak French navigate public spaces more easily.
6. Use technology: Utilize technology such as mobile apps or digital wayfinding systems to provide real-time information and navigation assistance to non-French speakers. These tools can also be programmed to provide information in multiple languages.
7. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage the community to embrace diversity and promote inclusivity in public spaces. This can involve hosting cultural events, promoting language classes or workshops, and creating opportunities for individuals to connect with one another.
8. Provide language support services: Offer language support services such as translation assistance or interpretation services to help non-French speakers access public services and navigate public spaces more easily.
9. Design inclusive spaces: Ensure that public spaces are designed to be accessible and inclusive for individuals with disabilities. This can involve providing Braille signage, audio signals for elevators and doors, and accessible seating areas
