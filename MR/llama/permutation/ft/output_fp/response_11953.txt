Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Native and Recent Immigrant Individuals in an Ultra-Conservative Context

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those from diverse backgrounds. In an ultra-conservative context, where traditional values and beliefs are deeply ingrained, the influence of cultural heritage on identity formation can be even more pronounced. This paper explores the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of Native and recent immigrant individuals in an ultra-conservative context.

Theoretical Framework:
This study draws upon intersectionality theory, which posits that multiple identity categories (such as race, gender, and class) intersect and influence each other to produce unique experiences of discrimination and oppression. Within this framework, cultural heritage serves as a crucial intersectional factor, shaping the identities of individuals through their shared cultural practices, values, and beliefs.

Native Individuals:
For Native individuals, cultural heritage plays a vital role in constructing identity. Growing up in an ultra-conservative context, they may experience discrimination and marginalization based on their race or ethnicity. However, through cultural practices such as storytelling, music, and traditional dance, Native individuals can connect with their ancestors and cultural heritage, fostering a sense of belonging and identity. The preservation and celebration of cultural heritage among Native communities can serve as a form of resistance against oppressive systems, allowing individuals to assert their identities and challenge dominant narratives.

Recent Immigrant Individuals:
Recent immigrants to an ultra-conservative context may also face challenges in navigating their cultural heritage. As they encounter new social norms and values, they may feel pressure to conform or risk marginalization. However, through cultural practices such as language, food, and religion, recent immigrants can maintain connections to their home cultures while adapting to their new surroundings. By embracing both their host culture and their cultural heritage, recent immigrants can construct a complex identity that transcends traditional dichotomies of belonging or exclusion.
