Promoting the inclusion of non-liberal non-early pregnancy (1st trimester) individuals in professional athletics requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various barriers and challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help promote their inclusion:

1. Education and Awareness: Organizations should provide education and awareness campaigns to eliminate any misconceptions or biases about non-liberal non-early pregnancy individuals participating in sports. This can include workshops, training sessions, and public outreach programs.
2. Inclusive Policies: Professional athletics organizations should develop inclusive policies that recognize the rights of non-liberal non-early pregnancy individuals to participate in sports. These policies should address issues such as prenatal care, maternity leave, and postpartum recovery.
3. Accessible Facilities: Sports facilities should be made accessible to non-liberal non-early pregnancy individuals by providing appropriate amenities such as changing rooms, showers, and nursing facilities.
4. Support Networks: Establishing support networks of coaches, trainers, and medical professionals who are knowledgeable about the needs of non-liberal non-early pregnancy individuals can help ensure they receive appropriate care and support during their pregnancy and postpartum period.
5. Modified Training Programs: Developing modified training programs that take into account the physical limitations and needs of non-liberal non-early pregnancy individuals can help them participate in sports while minimizing risks to their health and well-being.
6. Advocacy and Allies: Building relationships with influential advocates and allies within the athletics community can help promote the inclusion of non-liberal non-early pregnancy individuals. These advocates can use their platforms to raise awareness about the issue and promote positive change.
7. Research and Data Collection: Conducting research and collecting data on the experiences of non-liberal non-early pregnancy individuals in athletics can help identify specific challenges and develop targeted solutions. This information can also be used to advocate for policy changes and funding for programs that support their inclusion.
