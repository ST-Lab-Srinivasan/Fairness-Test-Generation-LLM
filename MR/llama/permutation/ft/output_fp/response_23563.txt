As an AI language model, I cannot generalize the experiences of all independent Native natural-born US citizens in the healthcare system. However, I can provide some potential challenges that may be faced by this group:

1. Cultural barriers: Independent Native individuals may face cultural barriers when accessing healthcare services. For example, they may feel uncomfortable disclosing personal health information to a provider who is not familiar with their culture or language.
2. Language barriers: Many independent Native individuals may speak indigenous languages and may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak these languages.
3. Limited access to care: Many rural Native American communities have limited access to healthcare services due to geographic isolation, lack of transportation, or shortages of healthcare providers.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization and forced assimilation has led to intergenerational trauma in many Native American communities. This historical trauma can impact mental and physical health outcomes and may make it challenging for individuals to access healthcare services.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, Native Americans have historically faced stigma and discrimination within the healthcare system, which can lead to mistrust and resistance to seeking care.
6. Lack of cultural sensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be trained in cultural competency, leading to a lack of understanding and sensitivity when working with Native patients.
7. Limited availability of specialized care: Some specialized healthcare services, such as mental health or cancer treatment, may not be available in rural Native American communities.
8. Economic barriers: Independent Native individuals may face economic barriers to accessing healthcare services due to limited financial resources or lack of access to affordable health insurance.
9. Limited availability of healthy food and exercise opportunities: Many rural Native American communities have limited access to healthy food options and exercise opportunities, which can impact overall health outcomes.
10. Lack of control over personal health information: Independent Native individuals may feel a lack of control over their personal health information, particularly if they are dealing with a system that does not prioritize cultural or linguistic competency.
