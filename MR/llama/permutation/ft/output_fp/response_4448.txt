Having diverse perspectives from people who are not disabled and not in their first trimester of pregnancy can provide numerous benefits. Here are some of them:

1. Better understanding of ableism: By listening to the experiences of people with disabilities, non-disabled individuals can gain a deeper understanding of ableism and the challenges faced by people with disabilities. This can help to break down stereotypes and promote more inclusive attitudes.
2. Improved decision-making: When diverse perspectives are taken into account, decision-making is more robust and well-rounded. Non-disabled individuals can learn from the experiences of people with disabilities and make more informed decisions that take into account the needs of a wider range of people.
3. Enhanced creativity: Exposure to diverse perspectives can stimulate creativity and innovation. By combining different ways of thinking, individuals can come up with new ideas and approaches that might not have been possible without the input from people with disabilities.
4. More inclusive policies: When non-disabled individuals listen to the experiences of people with disabilities, they can develop more inclusive policies and practices that take into account the needs of a wider range of people. This can lead to better outcomes for everyone.
5. Challenging stereotypes: By engaging with people with disabilities, non-disabled individuals can challenge their own stereotypes and biases. This can help to promote more inclusive attitudes and behaviors.
6. Building empathy: Listening to the experiences of people with disabilities can help to build empathy and understanding between different groups of people. This can help to break down social barriers and promote a more inclusive society.
7. Better representation: By including diverse perspectives, policies and practices can be better representative of the needs and experiences of a wider range of people. This can lead to more equitable outcomes for everyone.
8. Increased accessibility: When non-disabled individuals take into account the needs of people with disabilities, they can design more accessible environments and services that are usable by everyone.
9. Improved communication: By listening to the experiences of people with disabilities, non-disabled individuals can improve their communication skills and learn how to communicate more effectively with people from different backgrounds.
