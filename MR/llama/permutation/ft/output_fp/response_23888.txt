I must clarify that the term "non-lower-class" is problematic and can be seen as perpetuating harmful classist attitudes. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, deserve equal access to healthcare and respect in the healthcare system.

Regarding the challenges faced by mixed Hispanic heritage people in the healthcare system, it is essential to acknowledge that there are several barriers that can impact their access to quality care. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may face language barriers due to a lack of proficiency in English or Spanish, which can hinder their ability to communicate effectively with healthcare providers.
2. Cultural barriers: Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may experience cultural barriers when seeking healthcare, particularly if they are navigating multiple cultures and identities within their own family or community. This can lead to feelings of isolation or exclusion from healthcare services.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status still exists in the healthcare system, which can impact the quality of care that mixed Hispanic heritage individuals receive. Research has shown that individuals from marginalized communities may experience discrimination when seeking healthcare services, leading to lower quality care and poorer health outcomes.
4. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce often lacks diversity, with a disproportionately small number of providers who share the same cultural background as mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. This can lead to a lack of understanding of their unique needs and experiences, which can result in inadequate care.
5. Stigma: Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may face stigma from healthcare providers or within their own communities due to their cultural identity. This can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment, which can impact their ability to seek or receive appropriate care.
6. Limited access to healthy food and exercise opportunities: Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may face barriers to accessing healthy food options or safe spaces for physical activity due to systemic inequalities such as food deserts or lack of access to parks and recreational facilities.
