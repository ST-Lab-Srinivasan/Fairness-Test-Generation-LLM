Older adults who are native speakers of Arabic may face a range of challenges when interacting with the healthcare system, particularly if they do not speak English or their local language is not widely spoken by healthcare providers. Some common challenges faced by very old (90s+) native Arabic speaker people in the healthcare system include:

1. Language barriers: Older adults who are not fluent in the dominant language of their region may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of their medical needs and treatment plans.
2. Cultural differences: Arabic culture places a strong emphasis on family and community support, which can create challenges when navigating the healthcare system as an older adult who may be living alone or without supportive family members.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: Older adults in rural areas or those with limited mobility may have difficulty accessing healthcare facilities, particularly if they do not have reliable transportation or live far from urban areas.
4. Lack of cultural sensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of older Arabic speakers, leading to inappropriate or insensitive care.
5. Limited literacy: Some older adults may have limited literacy skills, making it difficult for them to complete medical forms or understand written information provided by healthcare providers.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Older Arabic speakers may face barriers in accessing specialized care, such as geriatric care, rehabilitation services, or palliative care, due to language and cultural barriers.
7. Discrimination: Unfortunately, older adults from minority backgrounds may experience discrimination in the healthcare system, leading to a lack of trust and confidence in seeking medical care.
8. Stigma associated with aging: Older Arabic speakers may face stigma and negative attitudes towards aging, which can lead to delays in seeking medical care or adherence to treatment plans.
9. Lack of advocacy: Older adults who are not fluent in the local language may have difficulty advocating for their own healthcare needs or navigating the system on their own.
10. Limited availability of cultural and linguistic resources
