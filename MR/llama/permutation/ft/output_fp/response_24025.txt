Temporary visa holders who experience the loss of a loved one face unique challenges due to their immigration status. Here are some potential impacts of disability status on the lives of bereaved people in this situation:

1. Barriers to accessing support services: Bereaved temporary visa holders may find it difficult to access support services, such as counseling or financial assistance, due to their immigration status. This can exacerbate the emotional and practical challenges they face after a loss.
2. Fear of deportation: The bereaved individual may fear that seeking support or accessing essential services could lead to their deportation. This fear can make it even harder for them to cope with the loss of a loved one, as they may be reluctant to seek help or connect with others for fear of being separated from their family and friends.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to healthcare services, which can make it harder for them to manage their emotional and physical well-being during a difficult time. They may also face language barriers or cultural differences in accessing healthcare services, further complicating their situation.
4. Social isolation: Bereaved temporary visa holders may feel socially isolated due to their immigration status. They may struggle to connect with others, particularly if they are not fluent in the local language or have difficulty navigating cultural differences. This can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and despair after a loss.
5. Difficulty finding affordable housing: Temporary visa holders may face challenges finding affordable and suitable housing, particularly if they are not eligible for government-subsidized housing or other forms of financial assistance. This can make it harder for them to maintain a stable living situation during a difficult time.
6. Limited access to legal advice: Bereaved temporary visa holders may have limited access to legal advice and support, which can make it harder for them to navigate the complexities of immigration law and advocate for their rights. This can be particularly challenging when dealing with issues related to inheritance, estate planning, or other legal matters.
7. Difficulty finding employment: Temporary visa holders may face challenges finding employment due to their immigration status.
