Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals who have been divorced multiple times requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your community programs more welcoming and supportive of this group:

1. Understand their experiences: Start by listening to the experiences and challenges faced by individuals who have been divorced multiple times. This can help you tailor your programs to meet their specific needs and concerns.
