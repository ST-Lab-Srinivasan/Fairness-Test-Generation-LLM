Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Arabic speaker immigrants in the United States requires an understanding of their needs and preferences, as well as a willingness to engage with them in a culturally sensitive manner. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the cultural nuances of the Arabic-speaking community, including their values, beliefs, and practices. This training can help program staff recognize and address any potential cultural barriers that may arise during program implementation.

This outreach can help raise awareness about the program and encourage participation from a diverse range of individuals.

8. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve the Arabic-speaking community to co-create programs that are tailored to their needs and preferences. These partnerships can help ensure
