3. Speak up: Use your voice to advocate for the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency, marital status, or other characteristics. Challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices, and promote inclusivity and respect.
4. Support inclusive policies and practices: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, such as language support services, accommodations for diverse needs, and anti-discrimination measures.
5. Engage in community building: Build bridges between different communities by promoting mutual understanding, respect, and empathy. Organize events or activities that bring people together and celebrate diversity.
