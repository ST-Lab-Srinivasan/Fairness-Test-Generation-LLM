Creating more inclusive housing policies for individuals who are not in their early pregnancy or lifelong single can be achieved by considering the following strategies:

1. Flexible Housing Options: Offer a range of housing options that cater to different life stages and needs, such as shared accommodation, co-living spaces, and intergenerational housing. This allows individuals to choose the living arrangement that best suits their current circumstances.
2. Income-based Rent Subsidies: Provide income-based rent subsidies to eligible households, ensuring that they can afford housing without sacrificing other essential needs such as food and healthcare. This support can be targeted towards individuals who are not in their early pregnancy or lifelong single, but may face financial challenges due to various reasons.
3. Supportive Housing Programs: Develop and implement supportive housing programs that provide additional services and resources to help individuals navigate the challenges of independent living. This can include case management, mental health counseling, and access to community-based services.
4. Age-friendly Design: Incorporate age-friendly design principles into housing developments, ensuring that they are accessible and adaptable for people of all ages. This can include features such as wider doorways, lower countertops, and accessible bathroom and kitchen fixtures.
5. Intergenerational Housing: Encourage intergenerational housing models, where older adults live alongside younger generations, fostering a sense of community and support. This can help to address social isolation and provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and mutual support.
6. Family-friendly Policies: Implement family-friendly policies in the workplace and society at large, such as flexible working arrangements, parental leave, and access to childcare services. This can help individuals who are not in their early pregnancy or lifelong single to balance work and family responsibilities more effectively.
7. Education and Awareness: Offer educational resources and workshops that promote inclusive housing options and challenge traditional notions of family structure. This can help to raise awareness and combat discrimination against non-traditional families.
8. Regulatory Reforms: Advocate for regulatory reforms
