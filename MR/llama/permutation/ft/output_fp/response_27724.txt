Unmarried individuals, including those who are single, divorced, or widowed, may face several challenges when it comes to accessing healthcare services. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: Many unmarried individuals may not have access to health insurance through their employer or a spouse's plan, which can make it difficult for them to afford medical care.
2. Limited financial resources: Unmarried individuals may have limited financial resources, which can make it challenging for them to pay for medical expenses out of pocket.
3. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The healthcare system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Unmarried individuals may face additional challenges in navigating the system and finding the care they need.
