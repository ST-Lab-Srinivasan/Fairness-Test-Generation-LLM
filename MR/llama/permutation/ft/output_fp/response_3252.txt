1. Encourage budgeting and saving: Teach casual Buddhists to create a budget and prioritize their spending based on their values and goals. Encourage them to save regularly and make the most of their financial resources.
2. Offer financial planning workshops: Host workshops or online classes that teach casual Buddhists how to manage their finances effectively, including how to create a budget, invest wisely, and plan for retirement.
3. Provide access to financial resources: Offer access to financial resources such as books, articles, and podcasts that provide practical advice on managing money. Encourage casual Buddhists to learn from these resources and apply them to their lives.
