Documented not newly married (DNNM) individuals, also known as unmarried or single persons, face various challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Lack of representation: DNNMs may feel marginalized or underrepresented in the healthcare system due to a lack of consideration for their unique needs and experiences. They may not be included in healthcare decision-making processes, research studies, or public health initiatives.
2. Limited access to care: DNNMs may face barriers when trying to access healthcare services, such as difficulty navigating complex healthcare systems, lack of knowledge about available resources, or limited financial means to pay for healthcare services.
3. Stigma and discrimination: DNNMs may encounter stigma and discrimination in the healthcare system due to societal attitudes towards singleness or unmarried status. Healthcare providers may hold biases or make assumptions based on their marital status, which can affect the quality of care they receive.
4. Limited support: DNNMs may not have a support system in place, such as a spouse or partner, to help them navigate the healthcare system or provide emotional support during illness or injury.
5. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not be culturally competent in addressing the unique needs and experiences of DNNMs, which can result in inadequate care or misdiagnosis.
6. Limited understanding of health disparities: DNNMs may face health disparities due to systemic barriers, such as limited access to healthy food options, safe living environments, or inadequate transportation. Healthcare providers may not fully understand these disparities and their impact on DNNMs' health.
7. Limited advocacy: DNNMs may have limited ability to advocate for themselves due to social isolation, limited access to resources, or lack of knowledge about their rights as patients.
8. Lack of education: Healthcare providers may not provide adequate education on preventive care, healthy behaviors, or disease management specifically tailored to DNNMs' needs and experiences.
9. Limited access to specialized care: DNNMs may face barriers
