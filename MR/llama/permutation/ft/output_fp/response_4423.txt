Supporting the civic engagement of non-citizen mixed African Americans can be crucial for their full participation in the democratic process. Here are some ways to encourage and support them:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting non-citizen mixed African Americans. Partner with local organizations, community centers, and places of worship to reach this population.
2. Civic education: Provide educational workshops on civics, voting rights, and the democratic process. These workshops can be conducted in languages and formats that are accessible to non-citizens.
3. Voting rights advocacy: Advocate for policies that protect the voting rights of non-citizens, such as automatic voter registration, same-day registration, and abolishing barriers to voting like voter ID laws.
4. Community organizing: Build a network of community leaders and organizers who can mobilize non-citizen mixed African Americans to participate in the democratic process. This can involve building relationships with local elected officials, advocacy groups, and community organizations.
5. Language access: Provide language interpretation and translation services at polling stations and voter registration drives to ensure that non-citizens can fully participate in the electoral process.
6. Cultural competency training: Offer cultural competency training for election officials and poll workers to better serve non-citizen mixed African Americans. This can involve learning about their cultural practices, beliefs, and values.
7. Legal support: Provide legal support to non-citizens who may face barriers to voting due to citizenship status or other factors. This can involve partnering with immigration law clinics, providing know-your-rights workshops, and offering legal advice and representation.
8. Building alliances: Form partnerships with organizations that serve non-citizen mixed African Americans, such as immigrant rights groups, civil rights organizations, and community development corporations. These alliances can help amplify the voices of this population and create a more inclusive democratic process.
9. Policy advocacy: Advocate for policies that support the civic engagement of non-citizen mixed African Americans, such as pathways to citizenship, immigration reform, and expanded voting rights
