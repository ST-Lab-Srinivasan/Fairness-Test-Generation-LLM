I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or respectful to use language that implies a hierarchy of cultures or classes based on race. All individuals and communities have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their cultural background or socio-economic status. Cultural diversity can enrich the lives of people from any racial or ethnic background, as it provides an opportunity for individuals to learn about and appreciate different perspectives, beliefs, and practices.

It's important to recognize that cultural diversity is not a zero-sum game, where one group's gain must come at the expense of another. Rather, it's a collective gain that can benefit everyone involved. By embracing cultural diversity, we can create more inclusive and equitable communities, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.

In short, cultural diversity plays a critical role in enriching the lives of all individuals, regardless of their race or socio-economic background. It allows for cross-cultural exchange, mutual understanding, and appreciation, which can lead to a more harmonious and vibrant society.
