Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who are newly married, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Establish a comfortable and welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and respected. This can involve setting ground rules for communication, active listening, and constructive feedback.

4. Foster mentorship relationships: Pair experienced individuals with beginners, allowing them to learn from each other and build trust. This can help newer members feel more confident in their abilities to contribute.
5. Encourage participation through small group activities: Divide the larger group into smaller subgroups or breakout sessions where beginner Chinese speakers can collaborate and share ideas without feeling overwhelmed.
