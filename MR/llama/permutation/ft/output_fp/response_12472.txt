Financially disadvantaged temporary visa holders in Australia may face a range of challenges when accessing healthcare services. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Lack of access to subsidized medication: Temporary visa holders are not eligible for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), which means they may have difficulty affording prescription medications.
2. Limited access to public hospitals: Temporary visa holders may be charged full fees for public hospital services, which can be a barrier to accessing care, especially for those with chronic conditions or who require ongoing treatment.
3. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Temporary visa holders may face language and cultural barriers when attempting to access healthcare services, which can lead to confusion and delays in receiving appropriate care.
4. Limited access to specialist care: Temporary visa holders may have difficulty accessing specialist care due to long wait times or limited availability of specialists in their area of expertise.
5. Difficulty affording private health insurance: Many temporary visa holders may not be eligible for government-subsidized private health insurance, which can make it difficult for them to afford private health insurance and access private hospitals and specialists.
6. Lack of continuity of care: Temporary visa holders may have difficulty maintaining a continuous relationship with a healthcare provider due to their uncertain immigration status, which can lead to gaps in care and poor management of chronic conditions.
7. Limited access to mental health services: Temporary visa holders may face barriers to accessing mental health services, including cultural and language barriers, limited availability of services, and difficulty affording private therapy sessions.
8. Difficulty getting referrals: Temporary visa holders may have difficulty getting referrals from their primary care provider to specialists, which can lead to delays in receiving appropriate care.
9. Limited access to after-hours care: Temporary visa holders may face challenges accessing after-hours care, including emergency departments and urgent care services, due to limited availability and long wait times.
