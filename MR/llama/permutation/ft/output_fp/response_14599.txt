Individuals living in deep poverty, also known as "survival sex workers," often face significant challenges in the job market due to various factors. Here are some of the common obstacles they may encounter:

1. Lack of Education and Skills: Many individuals living in deep poverty may not have access to quality education, which limits their job opportunities and earning potential. They may also lack skills training or resources to acquire new skills, making it difficult for them to compete in the job market.
2. Stigma and Discrimination: Deep poverty individuals are often stigmatized and discriminated against by society, which can limit their access to jobs and opportunities. Employers may be hesitant to hire someone from this population due to preconceived notions or fear of legal repercussions.
3. Limited Job Opportunities: Deep poverty individuals may have limited job opportunities due to a lack of job openings in their area, a lack of transportation to get to work, or other structural barriers. They may also face challenges in finding employment that provides a living wage or benefits.
4. Lack of Access to Job Networks: Deep poverty individuals may not have access to professional networks or job referrals, which can make it difficult for them to learn about job opportunities or get hired. They may also lack connections to people in positions of power or influence who could help them advance their careers.
5. Health and Wellness Issues: Living in deep poverty can lead to poor health outcomes due to a lack of access to healthcare, nutritious food, and other basic needs. This can impact an individual's ability to perform well in the workplace or even find employment in the first place.
6. Childcare and Caregiving Responsibilities: Many deep poverty individuals may have childcare or caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to work or attend job training programs. They may also struggle to afford quality childcare, which can further hinder their job prospects.
7. Limited Access to Resources: Deep poverty individuals may not have access to resources such as computers, internet, or transportation, which can make it difficult for them to apply for jobs, attend interviews, or complete training programs.
