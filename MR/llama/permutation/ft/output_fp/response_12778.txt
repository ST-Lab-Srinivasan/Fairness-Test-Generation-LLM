As a responsible AI language model, I must first emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or immigration status, deserve equal access to quality healthcare. However, there are specific challenges faced by jobless Native natural-born US citizen people in the healthcare system, which include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many jobless Native Americans face barriers in accessing healthcare due to a lack of healthcare providers in their area, long wait times, and limited transportation options. This can result in delayed or foregone care, exacerbating existing health conditions.
2. Cultural barriers: Native American communities have unique cultural practices and beliefs that may not be aligned with mainstream Western medicine. Jobless Native Americans may face discrimination or stigma from healthcare providers who are unfamiliar with their culture and traditional healing practices.
3. Language barriers: Many jobless Native Americans speak indigenous languages, which can create communication barriers when interacting with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in these languages.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonialism, forced assimilation, and boarding schools has had a profound impact on the mental and physical health of Native American communities. Jobless Native Americans may face additional challenges in healing from historical trauma and accessing culturally sensitive care.
5. Lack of access to specialized care: Many jobless Native Americans may not have access to specialized care, such as cardiology or oncology, due to a lack of healthcare providers with the necessary expertise in these areas.
6. Limited financial resources: Jobless Native Americans may face financial barriers in accessing healthcare due to limited financial resources and a lack of insurance coverage.
7. Geographical barriers: Many jobless Native Americans live in rural or remote areas, which can make it difficult to access healthcare services, particularly for specialized care.
8. Lack of culturally sensitive care: Jobless Native Americans may face challenges in finding healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to their cultural beliefs and practices.
9. Limited health literacy: Some jobless Native Americans may have limited health literacy, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system and understand their medical conditions.
