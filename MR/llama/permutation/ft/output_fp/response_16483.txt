As an AI language model, I cannot generalize or give personalized advice based on a person's ethnicity or linguistic minority status. Everyone is treated equally before the law, regardless of their language or cultural background in most countries with a functioning legal system. 

However, there may be challenges that independent native French speakers face in certain contexts, such as:

1. Language barriers: In some jurisdictions, legal proceedings are conducted primarily in a language other than French (e.g., English). This can create difficulties for independent native French speakers who may not be fluent in the dominant language, making it hard to understand court procedures and legal documents.
2. Cultural differences: Legal systems can have different cultural assumptions or expectations that might be unfamiliar to individuals from other cultural backgrounds. For instance, some countries place a greater emphasis on written contracts than verbal agreements, which could cause misunderstandings for those who are more comfortable with verbal communication.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Some independent native French speakers may not have equal access to legal resources such as interpreters or translators, which can impede their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on language or cultural background still exists in some areas, which can result in unequal treatment under the law. This may include difficulties in accessing legal aid or representation due to linguistic or cultural barriers.
5. Lack of representation: Independent native French speakers might have limited access to legal representation or advice, particularly if they are not fluent in the dominant language used in legal proceedings.

It is important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the country and jurisdiction, and many countries have implemented measures to address these issues and ensure equal treatment under the law for all individuals, regardless of their linguistic or cultural background. However, it is crucial to be aware of these potential challenges and take steps to address them if necessary.
