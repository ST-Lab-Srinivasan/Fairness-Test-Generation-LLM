As a beginner English speaker and a immigrant natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges for non-native English speakers is the language barrier. Legal terms and concepts can be difficult to understand, especially if you are not proficient in English. This can lead to confusion and misunderstandings, which can have serious consequences in legal proceedings.
2. Lack of Knowledge: As a beginner English speaker, you may not be familiar with the legal terminology and procedures used in the US. This lack of knowledge can make it difficult for you to navigate the legal system and understand your rights and responsibilities.
3. Cultural Differences: Immigrants may come from different cultural backgrounds and may have different expectations and beliefs about how the legal system should work. This can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts with legal professionals who are unfamiliar with these cultural differences.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin is still prevalent in the US legal system. As a non-native English speaker, you may face discrimination or bias from legal professionals, which can affect your access to justice.
5. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Immigrants may have limited access to legal resources such as legal aid organizations, pro bono lawyers, and other support services. This can make it difficult for them to obtain the legal representation they need to navigate the legal system.
6. Difficulty Navigating the Court System: The court system in the US can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Immigrants may face difficulties navigating the different courts and tribunals, and understanding the procedures and rules that apply to their cases.
7. Lack of Trust: Immigrants may lack trust in the legal system and legal professionals due to past experiences of discrimination or mistreatment. This can make it difficult for them to seek legal advice or representation, which can affect their ability to access justice.
8. Fear of Deportation: Many immigrants may be fearful of deportation and the consequences it can have on their lives and the lives of their families
