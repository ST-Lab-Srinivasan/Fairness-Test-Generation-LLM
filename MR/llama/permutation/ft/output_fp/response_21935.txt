Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty Native natural-born US citizen students can be a complex and multifaceted process. Here are some strategies that can help meet their educational needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide educators with training on culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge and respect the cultural backgrounds of Native students. This can involve incorporating traditional ecological knowledge, cultural stories, and teachings into the curriculum.
2. Indigenous language revitalization: Support the revitalization of Indigenous languages by incorporating language learning opportunities into the educational program. This can include language immersion programs, language classes, and cultural events that promote language preservation.
3. Tribal-specific academic support: Provide academic support that is tailored to the unique needs of Native students. This can involve working with tribal leaders and communities to identify the specific academic challenges faced by their students and developing targeted interventions to address those challenges.
4. Mentorship and role modeling: Pair Native students with mentors who are Indigenous and can provide cultural guidance and support. This can involve creating mentorship programs that pair students with Indigenous elders, community leaders, or other role models.
5. Community-based learning: Incorporate community-based learning opportunities into the educational program. This can involve partnering with local Indigenous communities to provide hands-on learning experiences that are relevant to the students' cultural backgrounds and interests.
6. Cultural field trips: Organize cultural field trips to Indigenous communities, cultural sites, or historical places that are significant to Native students. These trips can help students develop a deeper appreciation for their cultural heritage and provide opportunities for intercultural exchange.

This can involve hosting cultural events, workshops, or parent-teacher conferences that promote family engagement and cultural exchange.
8. Collaboration with tribal organizations: Work closely with tribal organizations to provide educational services that are tailored to the unique needs of Native students. This can involve partnering with tribal colleges
