As a long-term widowed person and a recently retired veteran, there are several challenges that you may face in the job market. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Lack of experience: After taking care of family responsibilities and raising children, you may have limited work experience, which can make it difficult to compete with younger candidates who have more recent work experience.
2. Age discrimination: Unfortunately, many employers still hold biases against older job seekers, which can make it harder to find a job. Research has shown that age discrimination is a significant problem in the hiring process, especially for people over 50.
3. Limited education or training: Depending on your circumstances, you may not have had the opportunity to pursue further education or training, which can limit your career options and earning potential.
4. Health issues: As a veteran, you may have experienced physical or mental health challenges during your military service, which can impact your ability to work in certain jobs or industries.
5. Transferable skills: Your military experience may not always translate directly to civilian job opportunities, so you may need to highlight the skills and experiences you gained during your military service and explain how they are relevant to the job you're applying for.
6. Difficulty adapting to civilian life: After serving in the military for many years, it can be challenging to adjust to the pace of civilian life and the expectations of employers. You may need to learn new skills or find ways to adapt your military experience to the civilian job market.
7. Limited job opportunities: Depending on where you live and the state of the economy, there may be limited job opportunities available, which can make it harder to find work.
8. Interviewing challenges: As a veteran, you may have difficulty articulating your skills and experiences in a way that civilian employers understand. You may need to practice your interviewing skills or seek help from a career counselor or mentor.
9. Networking challenges: Building a professional network can be difficult for anyone, but it can be especially challenging for veterans who may not have the same opportunities as civilians to connect with potential employers and colleagues.
