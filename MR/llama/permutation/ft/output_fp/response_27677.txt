Independent Native natural-born US citizens face a number of challenges within the US healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of cultural competency: Many healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities are located in remote areas, making it difficult for residents to access healthcare services. Additionally, there may be a lack of healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about Native American culture and health issues.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages, which can create communication barriers with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in these languages.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has had a lasting impact on the health and well-being of Native American communities. This historical trauma can manifest in various ways, including higher rates of substance abuse, mental health issues, and chronic diseases.
5. Limited healthcare resources: Many Native American reservations have limited resources for healthcare, including a shortage of medical facilities, equipment, and personnel.
6. Health disparities: Native Americans experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems, compared to the general US population. They also experience shorter life expectancy and lower quality of life.
7. Limited health insurance coverage: Many Native Americans lack access to affordable health insurance, which can limit their ability to receive necessary medical care.
8. Mistrust of the healthcare system: Historical trauma and a lack of cultural competency in the healthcare system have led to mistrust and reluctance among some Native Americans to seek medical care or adhere to treatment plans.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Native Americans may face barriers to accessing specialized care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or neurosurgeons, due to a lack of providers in their area or limited transportation options.
10. Lack of culturally sensitive health education: Many health education materials and programs may not be tailored to the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities,
