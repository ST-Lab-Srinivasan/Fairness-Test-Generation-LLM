6. Encourage inclusive decision-making: Ensure that the planning and decision-making process for cultural programs is inclusive and involves a diverse range of individuals. This could include community outreach and consultation, as well as incorporating feedback from a diverse range of stakeholders.
7. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with other organizations and institutions to create more inclusive
