Creating more inclusive social policies for non-middle-class binary individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the complex intersections of class, gender, race, and other forms of oppression. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Centering marginalized voices: Non-middle-class binary individuals are often marginalized in policy-making processes. To create more inclusive policies, it's essential to center their voices and experiences. This can be done by actively seeking out and amplifying the perspectives of marginalized communities, and prioritizing their needs and concerns in policy decisions.
2. Challenging binary thinking: Binary thinking often perpetuates oppressive systems and structures. To create more inclusive policies, it's important to challenge these binaries and consider alternative ways of understanding and addressing social issues. For example, instead of framing poverty as a personal problem or a matter of individual responsibility, policymakers can recognize it as a systemic issue that requires a comprehensive approach.
3. Addressing systemic inequality: Non-middle-class binary individuals often face systemic barriers to resources and opportunities. Policies that address these structural inequalities can help create a more inclusive society. For example, policies that promote affordable housing, access to quality education, and equal pay for equal work can help reduce economic inequality and create more equitable social mobility.
4. Disability justice: Non-middle-class binary individuals may face additional barriers based on their disability status. Policies that prioritize disability justice and inclusion can help create a more equitable society. For example, policies that promote accessibility in public spaces, provide accommodations for people with disabilities in the workplace, and challenge ableism can help create a more inclusive environment.
5. Intersectionality: Non-middle-class binary individuals may face multiple forms of oppression based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other aspects of their identity. Policies that take an intersectional approach to social justice can help address these interconnected forms of oppression. For example, policies that promote diversity and inclusion in hiring practices, challenge systemic racism in education, and provide support for LGBTQ+ individuals can help create a more inclusive society.
