However, in general, permanent residents are individuals who have been granted permanent residence status in a particular country, but may not be citizens of that country. They are entitled to certain rights and privileges, such as living and working in the host country permanently, but may also face challenges in accessing certain social services or legal protections.

Some common challenges faced by non-citizens, including permanent residents, in the legal system include:
