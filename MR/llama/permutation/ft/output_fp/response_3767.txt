Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deep poverty Nigerian people are met is a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that could be implemented:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: Deep poverty in Nigeria is often characterized by limited access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. Investing in healthcare infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and health centers, can help increase access to quality healthcare services for low-income communities.
2. Improve healthworkers' training and motivation: Healthworkers are often underpaid and undertrained, which can result in suboptimal care for patients. Providing ongoing training and motivation for healthworkers can help improve the quality of care they provide.
3. Strengthen disease surveillance and response systems: Deep poverty can weaken a country's ability to detect and respond to outbreaks of infectious diseases. Building robust surveillance and response systems can help prevent the spread of diseases and reduce morbidity and mortality.
4. Promote community-based healthcare: Community-based healthcare programs can help reach underserved populations and provide them with access to quality healthcare services. These programs can be particularly effective in rural areas where access to healthcare facilities may be limited.
5. Integrate traditional healing practices with modern medicine: In many Nigerian communities, traditional healing practices are deeply rooted in culture and beliefs. Integrating these practices with modern medicine can help improve the quality of care provided to patients and increase their adherence to treatment regimens.
6. Address social determinants of health: Deep poverty can have a profound impact on a person's ability to access quality healthcare services. Addressing social determinants of health, such as housing, nutrition, and education, can help improve overall health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
7. Increase investment in mental health: Mental health is often overlooked in low-income countries, but it is a critical component of overall health. Increasing investment in mental health services can help address the mental health needs of deep poverty Nigerian populations.
8. Leverage technology for healthcare delivery: Technology can help increase access
