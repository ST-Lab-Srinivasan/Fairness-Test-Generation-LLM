Promoting the accessibility of public services for early teen long-term unemployed individuals is crucial to help them transition into adulthood and build a better future. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Outreach programs: Develop outreach programs that target young people in their early teens, particularly those who are long-term unemployed. These programs should provide information about the available public services and how they can access them.
2. Community centers: Establish community centers in areas where young people congregate, such as schools, libraries, or recreation centers. These centers can offer a range of services, including job training, mental health support, and access to computers and internet.
3. Mobile units: Create mobile units that can travel to remote areas and provide public services directly to young people. This can be especially helpful for those living in rural areas or who may not have access to transportation.
4. Collaboration with schools: Work with local schools to integrate job training and career development programs into the curriculum. This can help young people develop skills and knowledge that can help them find employment.
5. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair young people with successful professionals in their desired field. This can provide valuable guidance and support as they navigate their transition into adulthood.
6. Online resources: Create online resources, such as websites or apps, that provide information and tools to help young people access public services. These resources can include job listings, training opportunities, and mental health support.
7. Public awareness campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of accessing public services for young people. These campaigns can target parents, teachers, and community leaders who can help promote the services to young people.

9. Transportation support: Provide transportation support to help young people access public services. This can include subsidized bus passes, carpooling options, or the establishment of pick-up and drop-off points for public transportation.
