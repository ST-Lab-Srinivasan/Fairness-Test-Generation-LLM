To ensure that the educational needs of Native English Speaker Not Widowed For A Long Time (NESNWAFT) students are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Assess their linguistic proficiency: NESNWAFT students may have varying levels of proficiency in English, depending on their individual experiences and exposure to the language. Conducting assessments can help identify areas where they need additional support or scaffolding.
