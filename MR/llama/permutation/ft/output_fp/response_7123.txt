Protecting the legal rights of moderate nominal Christians and other religious groups requires a multifaceted approach that involves various strategies and policies. Here are some ways to ensure that their legal rights are protected:

1. Establishment Clause protections: The First Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibits the government from establishing any religion, including Christianity. This clause helps protect the legal rights of moderate nominal Christians by preventing the government from favoring one religion over another or from promoting religious beliefs over non-belief.
2. Free Exercise Clause protections: The First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause ensures that individuals have the right to practice their religion freely, as long as they do not harm others or infringe on their rights. This clause helps protect the legal rights of moderate nominal Christians by preventing the government from interfering with their ability to practice their faith without fear of persecution or discrimination.
3. Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRA): RFRAs are state and federal laws that aim to restore the protections of the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause, which have been eroded over time through judicial interpretations. These laws help protect the legal rights of moderate nominal Christians by providing additional safeguards against government interference with their religious beliefs and practices.
4. Anti-discrimination laws: Moderate nominal Christians, like any other religious group, have the right to be free from discrimination in employment, education, housing, and other areas. Anti-discrimination laws help protect their legal rights by prohibiting discriminatory practices based on religion or belief.
5. Education reform: Many moderate nominal Christians may send their children to public schools, where they may face pressure to conform to certain religious beliefs or practices. Education reform that promotes religious diversity and inclusivity can help protect the legal rights of these individuals by ensuring that their children are not forced to adhere to a particular religion or worldview.
6. Public accommodation laws: Moderate nominal Christians, like any other individual, have the right to be treated with dignity and respect in public spaces. Public accommodation laws help protect their legal rights by
