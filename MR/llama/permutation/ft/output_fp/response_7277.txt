4. Promote diversity and inclusion: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the community and include perspectives from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities.

11. Offer adaptive programming: Develop cultural programs that are adaptable to the needs of individuals with disabilities, such as offering adapted dance or theater performances.
