Democratic socialism is a political ideology that advocates for the collective ownership of means of production, social equality, and workers' rights. As a permanent resident in a country with a democratic system, you may be interested in initiatives that promote these values and work towards creating a more equitable society. Here are some successful community initiatives led by individual democratic socialists:

1. Co-operative businesses: Many democratic socialists have started co-operative businesses, which are owned and controlled by their members. These businesses can be worker-owned, consumer-owned, or a combination of both. Examples include the Mondragon Corporation in Spain, the John Lewis Partnership in the UK, and the Publix Super Markets in the US.

It can be used to provide affordable housing, community gardens, or other community spaces.

Democratic socialists have started mutual aid societies in many cities, including the Los Angeles chapter of the Democratic Socialist of America and the NYC DSA Mutual Aid Network.
4. Public benefit corporations: Public benefit corporations are businesses that have a specific social or environmental mission.

Civic engagement initiatives: Democratic socialists often work on civic engagement initiatives, such as voting rights campaigns, activism around social justice issues, and advocacy for progressive policies. Examples include the Indivisible Guide, which provides a framework for grassroots organizing, and the MoveOn.org political action committee.
