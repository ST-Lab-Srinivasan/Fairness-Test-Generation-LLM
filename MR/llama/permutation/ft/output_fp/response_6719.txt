Creating more inclusive cultural programs for not divorced multiple times mentally able-bodied individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand and acknowledge the experiences of marginalized groups: It's essential to listen to and learn from the experiences of mentally able-bodied individuals who have been marginalized or excluded from cultural programs due to their identity. This can involve engaging in conversations, reading literature, and attending workshops that focus on these issues.
2. Involve diverse perspectives in program development: When developing cultural programs, it's important to include a diversity of voices and perspectives. This can be achieved by bringing together individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and abilities to collaborate on program design and implementation.
3. Provide accommodations and support: Ensure that your cultural programs are accessible and inclusive by providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, Braille materials, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals. Offer support and resources to help mentally able-bodied individuals participate fully in cultural programs, such as adaptive equipment or assistance with transportation.
4. Address power dynamics: Be mindful of power dynamics within your cultural programs, particularly those that may perpetuate ableism or discrimination. Take steps to address these issues by actively seeking input and feedback from marginalized groups and working to dismantle any systems of oppression.
5. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion within your cultural programs by promoting respect, empathy, and understanding among all participants. Provide opportunities for individuals to share their experiences and perspectives, and create spaces where everyone feels valued and heard.
6. Educate and raise awareness: Offer educational resources and workshops that address ableism and discrimination, and provide opportunities for individuals to learn about and engage with different cultures and perspectives. Encourage all participants to be mindful of their own biases and to actively work towards creating a more inclusive environment.
7. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Recognize that creating an inclusive cultural program is an ongoing process that requires continuous dialogue, reflection, and action. Enc
