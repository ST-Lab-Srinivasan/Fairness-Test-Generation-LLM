To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Arabic speakers, including recently single students, are met, here are some strategies and suggestions:

1. Assess their level: Before designing any lesson plan, it's essential to assess the students' current level of proficiency in Arabic. This will help you identify their strengths, weaknesses, and areas that require more attention.
