Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-class, non-newly married individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help create a more equitable society:

1. Affordable Housing: Provide affordable housing options, including rental units and homeownership opportunities, to ensure that non-upper-class individuals have access to decent and safe housing. This can be achieved through government subsidies, tax incentives for developers, and zoning regulations that encourage mixed-income housing.
2. Education and Training: Offer accessible and affordable education and training programs, including vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs, to help non-upper-class individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability. This can also include programs aimed at reducing the gender and racial wage gap.
3. Healthcare Access: Ensure that non-upper-class individuals have access to affordable and quality healthcare services, including mental health support. This can be achieved through expanded Medicaid coverage, subsidized health insurance programs, and investment in community health centers.
4. Job Creation and Support: Foster job creation and support for non-upper-class individuals by providing incentives for businesses that hire and train low-income workers, creating jobs in underserved communities, and investing in workforce development programs.
5. Childcare and Family Support: Provide affordable childcare options and family support services to help non-upper-class individuals balance work and family responsibilities. This can include subsidized childcare, parental leave policies, and support for single parents.
6. Income Support: Implement progressive taxation policies that redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor, and provide a safety net of social welfare programs, such as unemployment benefits, food assistance, and cash transfers, to help non-upper-class individuals during times of crisis.
7. Community Development: Invest in community development programs that promote social cohesion and inclusive growth, including community gardens, cooperatives, and microfinance initiatives. This can help build a sense of community and economic security among non-upper-class individuals.
