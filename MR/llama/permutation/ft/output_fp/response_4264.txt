Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner Spanish speakers, including cisgender individuals, requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some recommendations:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" and "women") and instead use gender-neutral terms like "people," "individuals," or "community." For example, instead of saying "The men are going to the gym," say "Everyone is welcome to join us at the gym."
2. Accessible Education: Provide education and resources that are accessible and inclusive of all gender identities. This can include using gender-neutral language in educational materials, providing accommodations for students who may not identify with traditional gender categories, and creating safe spaces for all students to learn and grow.
3. Gender-Neutral Facilities: Ensure that facilities are accessible and comfortable for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity. This can include providing gender-neutral restrooms, locker rooms, and changing areas.
4. Inclusive Hiring Practices: Ensure that hiring practices are inclusive of all gender identities. Use language in job postings that is inclusive and welcoming to all candidates, and consider using blind hiring processes to help eliminate unconscious bias.
5. Support for Transgender and Non-Binary Individuals: Provide support and resources specifically for transgender and non-binary individuals. This can include access to gender-affirming care, such as hormone therapy and gender confirmation surgeries, as well as mental health services to support individuals in their transition.
6. Advocacy and Allyship: Use your platform to advocate for the rights and dignity of all gender identities. This can include speaking out against discrimination and oppression, and actively supporting organizations that serve marginalized communities.
7. Community Building: Foster a sense of community and belonging among all individuals, regardless of their gender identity. This can involve creating spaces for people to connect and build relationships, as well as providing opportunities for people to share their experiences and perspectives.
8. Inclusive Policy-Making: Ensure that policy-making processes are inclusive of all gender identities.
