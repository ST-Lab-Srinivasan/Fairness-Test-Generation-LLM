Addressing the specific needs of Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, cultural backgrounds, and socio-economic challenges. Here are some strategies to address their specific needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train educators to understand the cultural practices, values, and beliefs of Native American communities. This can involve incorporating traditional teachings, stories, and language into the curriculum to make it more relevant and engaging for students.
2. Bilingual education: Offer bilingual education programs that teach in both English and the indigenous language of the student's community. This can help Native American students maintain their cultural identity while also improving their academic performance.
3. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and practices into science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. For example, teach about the medicinal properties of plants and how they can be used in modern medicine.
4. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that connect Native American students with successful Indigenous professionals in their communities. This can provide students with role models and help them see the potential for success in fields they may not have considered before.
5. Cultural events and workshops: Host cultural events and workshops that celebrate Native American traditions and practices. These can include powwows, drumming circles, and traditional craft-making activities.
6. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Indigenous organizations and communities to provide students with hands-on learning experiences and cultural immersion opportunities.
7. Support for language revitalization: Provide resources and support for Native American languages, which are often at risk of disappearing. This can involve hiring language teachers, developing language learning materials, and hosting language classes for community members.
8. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the unique needs of Native American students, such as those who may need to attend classes around traditional ceremonies or events.
9. Professional development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for educators to learn about Indigenous cultures, histories, and experiences. This can help them better understand and support the specific needs of Native American students.
