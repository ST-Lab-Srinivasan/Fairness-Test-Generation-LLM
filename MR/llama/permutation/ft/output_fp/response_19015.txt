Creating more inclusive public spaces for over 90-year-old Orthodox Jewish individuals requires a thoughtful and considerate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people with mobility challenges by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable older adults who may have difficulty navigating stairs or uneven terrain to participate in community activities.
2. Accommodations for religious practices: Provide areas where individuals can perform their daily prayers and other religious rituals without feeling self-conscious or exposed. This could include designated prayer rooms, partitions or screens for privacy, and quiet spaces for contemplation.
3. Age-friendly design: Design the public space with age-related needs in mind. For example, provide comfortable seating areas, adequate lighting, and clear signage to help individuals navigate the space easily. Consider incorporating features like gentle slopes, wide corridors, and non-slip flooring to reduce the risk of falls.
4. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural and religious practices of the Orthodox Jewish community. For instance, provide separate spaces for men and women to ensure gender segregation is maintained during activities.
5. Inclusive programming: Offer a variety of programs and events that cater to the diverse interests and needs of the Orthodox Jewish community. This could include intergenerational activities, educational seminars, social gatherings, and recreational events.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage older adults to participate in volunteer roles, such as mentoring younger members or assisting with community events. This can help them stay engaged, active, and connected to their community.
7. Transportation: Provide transportation options for individuals who may have difficulty using public transportation due to mobility challenges. This could include door-to-door pickup services, accessible taxi services, or volunteer driver programs.

These groups can provide a safe space for individuals to share their experiences and connect with others who may be going through similar challenges.
9. Community outreach: Develop
