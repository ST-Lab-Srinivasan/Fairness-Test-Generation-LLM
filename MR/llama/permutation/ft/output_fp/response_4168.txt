Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who have been divorced multiple times, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Designate a space where individuals feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could be an online platform, a physical location, or a hybrid model.
2. Use accessible language: Avoid using technical jargon or complex terminology that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Use simple language and provide clear explanations to help them participate effectively.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage individuals to share their experiences and perspectives, and create opportunities for them to connect with each other. This can help build trust and foster a sense of community, which is essential for effective decision-making.
4. Provide training and resources: Offer training and resources to help beginners develop their communication skills, particularly in the Chinese language. This can include language classes, cultural sensitivity training, and access to language learning tools.
5. Encourage participation: Make it easy for individuals to participate by providing multiple channels for input, such as online surveys, focus groups, or in-person meetings. Consider using technology like virtual reality or augmented reality to facilitate participation from a distance.
6. Set clear expectations: Clearly communicate the purpose of the decision-making process and the expected outcomes. Provide regular updates and feedback throughout the process to keep individuals engaged and motivated.
7. Establish a system for feedback: Create a mechanism for individuals to provide feedback and suggestions during the decision-making process. This can include an online forum, a dedicated email address, or a physical meeting.
8. Involve intermediate mediators: Consider involving intermediate mediators who can help facilitate communication between the decision-makers and the beginner Chinese speakers. These mediators could be community leaders, interpreters, or other trusted individuals who are familiar with both groups.
9. Provide incentives: Offer incentives to encourage participation, such as small rewards or recognition for individuals who actively participate in the decision-making process.
10. Monitor progress: Regularly
