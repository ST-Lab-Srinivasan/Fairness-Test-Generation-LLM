Highlighting the issues faced by low-income and marginalized communities, including those in Mexico, can be a complex task as it requires a comprehensive understanding of the social, economic, and political factors that affect their well-being. Here are some ways data can be used to highlight these issues:

1. Examine income distribution: Use statistical data to analyze the distribution of income in Mexico and identify the gaps between different socioeconomic groups. For instance, you could look at the Gini coefficient, which measures the level of inequality in the distribution of income. A higher Gini coefficient indicates more inequality.
2. Analyze poverty rates: Use data from official sources like the Mexican government or international organizations to analyze poverty rates in Mexico. Look at the number of people living below the poverty line and the percentage of the population that is poor. You could also examine the rates of extreme poverty, which is defined as living on less than $1.90 per day.
3. Investigate access to basic services: Use data to assess access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. For example, you could look at the number of doctors per 100,000 people, the literacy rate, or the percentage of the population with access to improved sanitation facilities.
4. Examine social exclusion: Use data to identify groups that are at risk of social exclusion, such as indigenous peoples, Afro-Mexicans, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Look at factors such as education levels, employment rates, and access to healthcare for these groups.
5. Analyze housing conditions: Use data to examine the quality of housing in Mexico. Look at factors such as overcrowding, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and the prevalence of substandard housing.
6. Investigate migration patterns: Use data to understand the reasons why people migrate within Mexico or from other countries. Look at factors such as economic conditions, violence, and political instability.
7. Examine health outcomes: Use data to assess the health outcomes of different communities in Mexico. Look at factors such as life expectancy, infant mortality rates, and prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and obesity.
