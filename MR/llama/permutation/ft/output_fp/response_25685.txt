Lower-income individuals who hold a passport may face several challenges when accessing healthcare services, particularly in countries with limited or underdeveloped healthcare systems. Here are some of the common challenges faced by these individuals:

1. Financial barriers: Lower-income individuals may struggle to afford medical treatment, tests, and prescription medications, which can lead to delayed or foregone care. In some cases, they may have to choose between paying for healthcare and other basic needs, such as food and housing.
2. Limited access to healthcare facilities: In rural or remote areas, lower-income individuals may have limited access to healthcare facilities, including clinics, hospitals, and specialized care. This can lead to longer wait times and delays in receiving necessary medical care.
3. Language barriers: Individuals who are not fluent in the local language may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, which can result in misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
4. Lack of awareness about healthcare services: Lower-income individuals may be less aware of their rights and entitlements under the healthcare system, including available services, coverage, and financial assistance programs.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may face discrimination or stigma when seeking healthcare, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
6. Difficulty navigating complex systems: Lower-income individuals may struggle to navigate the complex healthcare system, including finding providers, filing claims, and understanding insurance policies.
7. Limited availability of specialized care: In some countries, specialized medical care may be limited or unavailable in certain areas, particularly for lower-income individuals who may not have access to private healthcare options.
8. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Lower-income individuals may face additional barriers when seeking mental health services, including lack of availability, stigma, and financial constraints.
9. Limited access to preventive care: Lower-income individuals may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of health issues.
