Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper middle-income and non-recently widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of these groups. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Address income inequality: One of the primary reasons why non-upper middle-income individuals face exclusion from social policies is income inequality. Policymakers can implement progressive taxation, increase the minimum wage, and provide benefits such as housing subsidies or food assistance to help reduce income disparities.
2. Provide access to affordable healthcare: Ensure that all individuals have access to quality, affordable healthcare by implementing a universal healthcare system or improving existing public programs. This can include expanding Medicaid, creating state-based insurance marketplaces, and providing financial assistance for low-income individuals.
3. Improve education and job training: Many non-upper middle-income individuals face barriers to accessing quality education and job training. Policymakers can invest in public schools, community colleges, and vocational training programs to provide more opportunities for economic mobility.
4. Address systemic racism and discrimination: Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender can prevent non-upper middle-income individuals from accessing social services. Policymakers must address these issues by implementing anti-discrimination policies, promoting diversity and inclusion, and providing resources to marginalized communities.
5. Increase access to affordable housing: Housing costs can be a significant burden for non-upper middle-income individuals, leading to housing insecurity or homelessness. Policymakers can implement rent control measures, increase funding for affordable housing programs, and provide assistance for first-time homebuyers.
6. Promote social connections: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for non-upper middle-income individuals, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. Policymakers can invest in community programs, promote volunteer opportunities, and support initiatives that foster social connections.
7. Address mental health issues: Mental health challenges are prevalent across income groups but may be more severe for non-upper middle-income individuals
