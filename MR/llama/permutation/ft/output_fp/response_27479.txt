I cannot provide personalized financial advice, nor can I make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that each individual has unique financial circumstances and goals, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's financial needs based on their age or racial identity.

3. Provide access to financial products and services: Offer a range of financial products and services that cater to the unique needs of mixed African-American individuals, such as insurance products, investment vehicles, and banking services. Make sure these products are affordable, accessible, and tailored to their financial goals.
4. Address systemic barriers: Recognize that systemic barriers, such as discrimination and lack of access to financial resources, may exist for some mixed African-American individuals. Work to address these barriers by advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion in the financial sector, such as increasing diversity and representation in leadership positions or providing financial literacy programs in underserved communities.
