It is important to recognize that the experiences of individuals with different immigration statuses can vary greatly, and it is not appropriate to make generalizations about a group of people based on their immigration status. However, I can provide some general insights into the potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-lower middle-income non-liberal individuals:

1. Barriers to Basic Needs: Individuals with irregular or undocumented immigration status may face barriers in accessing basic needs such as healthcare, education, and employment. They may be denied access to these services due to their immigration status, which can hinder their ability to improve their socio-economic conditions.
2. Discrimination and Stigma: Non-liberal societies may have a history of discrimination against certain ethnic or national groups, including migrants and refugees. Individuals with irregular immigration status may face stigma and discrimination in their daily lives, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization.
3. Lack of Access to Social Services: In many non-liberal societies, undocumented migrants may be ineligible for social services such as housing, food assistance, and legal aid. This can leave them vulnerable to poverty, exploitation, and violence.
4. Fear of Deportation: Individuals with irregular immigration status may live in constant fear of deportation, which can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. The threat of deportation can also limit their ability to access basic needs such as healthcare and education.
5. Limited Political Power: Non-liberal societies often have limited political representation for marginalized groups, including migrants. This can limit their ability to advocate for their rights and interests, and can perpetuate systemic inequality.
6. Difficulty Accessing Legal Pathways: In some non-liberal societies, the legal pathways for migration are limited or restricted, which can make it difficult for individuals to obtain legal status. This can lead to a cycle of illegal migration, which can be dangerous and exploitative.
7. Vulnerability to Trafficking: Non-liberal societies may have limited protections against human trafficking, which can
