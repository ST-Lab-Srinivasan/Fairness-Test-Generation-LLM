Ensuring that the voices of native Arabic speakers, who are also native natural-born US citizens, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting diversity and inclusivity in the United States. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Representation in leadership positions: Encourage and support the election or appointment of Arabic speakers to leadership positions in government, businesses, and other organizations. This will provide a platform for their voices to be heard at the highest levels of decision-making.
2. Community engagement: Engage with local Arabic-speaking communities through outreach programs, town hall meetings, and other events. This will help build trust and foster dialogue between leaders and the communities they serve.
3. Language access: Provide language interpretation and translation services to ensure that Arabic speakers have equal access to information and opportunities for participation in decision-making processes.
4. Cultural competency training: Offer cultural competency training for leaders and decision-makers to help them understand the values, beliefs, and practices of Arabic-speaking communities. This will enable them to make more informed decisions that are responsive to the needs of these communities.
5. Community-based initiatives: Support community-based initiatives that empower Arabic speakers to take an active role in decision-making processes. This can include programs that provide training and resources for community leaders, as well as initiatives that promote civic engagement and participation.
6. Advocacy and activism: Advocate for policies and practices that promote the inclusion of Arabic speakers in decision-making processes. This can involve working with advocacy groups, organizing protests or rallies, and using social media to raise awareness about issues affecting these communities.
7. Education and awareness: Educate the broader community about the experiences and perspectives of Arabic speakers. This can involve organizing cultural events, exhibitions, and workshops that showcase the richness and diversity of Arabic culture.
8. Collaboration with other marginalized groups: Build alliances with other marginalized groups, such as Latinos, African Americans, and LGBTQ+ individuals. This can help create a stronger voice for Arabic speakers
