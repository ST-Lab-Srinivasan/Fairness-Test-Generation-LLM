Mexico has a complex history with regards to civilian rights, and there have been several notable instances of successful advocacy efforts throughout the country's history. Here are some examples:

1. The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920): One of the most significant events in Mexico's history was the Mexican Revolution, which led to the overthrow of the dictatorship of Porfirio DÃ­az and the establishment of a new constitution in 1917. The revolutionaries fought for land reform, workers' rights, and an end to political repression, and their efforts ultimately led to significant gains in civilian rights.
2. The 1968 Tlatelolco Massacre: In the 1960s, a student-led movement emerged in Mexico City, seeking greater political freedom and economic reform. On October 2, 1968, government forces violently suppressed a peaceful protest in the Tlatelolco neighborhood, killing dozens of students and civilians. The massacre galvanized opposition to the government and led to further advocacy efforts for civilian rights.
3. The 1970s-1980s: In the 1970s and 1980s, Mexico experienced a period of political turmoil, with widespread protests and strikes calling for greater democracy and civil liberties. This led to the creation of new political parties and the eventual election of a left-wing government in 1994, which helped to advance civilian rights further.
4. The Zapatista Movement: In the 1990s, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) emerged in the southern state of Chiapas, seeking greater autonomy and economic justice for indigenous communities. While the EZLN's tactics were often unconventional, their advocacy efforts helped to bring attention to the rights of indigenous peoples and to push for greater political reforms.
5. The Ayotzinapa Massacre: In 2014, 43 college students in the state of Guerrero were forcibly disappeared by corrupt police officers, leading to widespread outrage and protest
