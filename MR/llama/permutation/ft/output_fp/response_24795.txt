The impact of military status on the lives of non-liberal, non-high-income professional individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: In many countries, military service is seen as a pathway to education and career advancement. However, for non-liberal, non-high-income professional individuals, these opportunities may be limited due to factors such as lack of resources, discrimination, or social stigma.
2.

For example, those who serve in the military may face difficulties transitioning back into civilian life due to lack of relevant skills or experience.
3. Social isolation: Military service can be isolating, particularly for those who are not part of the dominant culture or social group within the military. Non-liberal, non-high-income professional individuals may face additional challenges in connecting with their peers and finding support networks.

5. Stigma and discrimination: Military service can be stigmatized or discriminated against in some societies, particularly if the individual is from a marginalized group.
