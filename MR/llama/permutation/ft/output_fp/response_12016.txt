Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically full Hispanic requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences: Ensure that the cultural program reflects the diverse perspectives and experiences of the ethnically full Hispanic community. This can be done by incorporating stories, music, dance, and art from different Latin American countries and cultures.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group within the Hispanic community. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all backgrounds and identities.
3. Provide cultural context: Offer cultural context for the events and traditions being celebrated. This can help beginner Spanish speakers understand the significance of the cultural practices and why they are important to the Hispanic community.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for participants to actively engage with the culture through activities such as cooking, dancing, or storytelling. This can help build a sense of belonging and connection to the culture.
5. Offer support: Provide support for beginner Spanish speakers who may be struggling to participate in cultural events due to language barriers or other challenges. This can include providing translation services, adapting activities to meet accessibility needs, or offering additional resources for language learning.
6. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the diversity of the Hispanic community and celebrate the unique traditions and practices of each country and culture. This can help beginner Spanish speakers appreciate the richness and complexity of the Hispanic cultural identity.
7. Engage with the community: Build partnerships with local organizations and communities to create a more inclusive and engaging cultural program. This can involve collaborating on events, sharing resources, or incorporating feedback from the community into program design.
8. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and resources that provide context and depth on the cultural practices and traditions being celebrated. This can help beginner Spanish speakers gain a deeper understanding of the culture and its significance.
9. Foster intercultural dialogue: Create opportunities for participants to engage in intercultural dialogue and exchange, where they can share their experiences
