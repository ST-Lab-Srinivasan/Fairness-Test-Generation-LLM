Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed Hispanic Heritages Ultra-Conservatives

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those from mixed backgrounds. The identities of ultra-conservative individuals with mixed Hispanic heritage are no exception. This paper seeks to explore how cultural heritage influences their sense of self and informs their beliefs, values, and practices.

Theoretical Framework:
Cultural heritage encompasses the customs, traditions, and history that a group of people inherit from their ancestors. For individuals with mixed Hispanic heritage, cultural heritage can be complex and multifaceted, consisting of multiple identities, languages, religions, and cultural practices. This complexity can shape their identities in various ways, including:

1. Sense of belonging: Individuals may feel a strong connection to one or more cultures in their heritage, which can influence their sense of belonging and identity.
2. Cultural values: The cultural values and beliefs of their ancestors can shape their worldview and inform their decisions and behaviors.
3. Intersectionality: The intersection of different cultures in their heritage can lead to a more nuanced understanding of identity, as individuals navigate multiple identities and experiences.
4. Resistance and rebellion: Ultra-conservative individuals with mixed Hispanic heritage may use cultural heritage as a means of resistance or rebellion against dominant cultures or societal norms.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews and focus groups to gather data from ultra-conservative individuals with mixed Hispanic heritage. Participants will be recruited through purposive sampling, ensuring a diverse range of experiences and perspectives. Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis, focusing on the ways in which cultural heritage shapes their identities and informs their beliefs and practices.

Expected findings:
This study will provide insight into how cultural heritage influences the identities of ultra-conservative individuals with mixed Hispanic heritage. Findings may include:
