Creating more inclusive community events for recently pregnant or parenting women requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some tips to help make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Communicate clearly: Make sure your event communication includes language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Use terms like "parent" or "caregiver" instead of "mother" or "father," and avoid making assumptions about someone's family status.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that your event location is wheelchair accessible and has a breastfeeding area, if needed. Provide gender-neutral restrooms or make sure there are designated areas for people of all genders to use.
3. Childcare options: Offer childcare services or provide information on local resources where parents can drop off their children during the event. This will help reduce stress and allow parents to fully participate in the event without worrying about their children's needs.
4. Inclusive programming: Plan activities that are inclusive of all gender identities, such as gender-neutral crafts or games. Avoid activities that assume a specific gender role or identity.
5. Gender-inclusive marketing: Use language in your promotional materials that is inclusive and respectful of all genders. Avoid using gendered terms like "moms" or "dads" and instead use language like "parents," "caregivers," or "guardians."
6. Flexible scheduling: Consider offering events at different times or locations to accommodate parents with varying schedules, such as those who need to attend during naps or after bedtime.
7. Support for diverse needs: Be aware of the diverse needs of your community and make sure your event is accessible to all. Provide accommodations like sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing.
8. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all genders during the event. Avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity or using language that is derogatory or offensive.
9. Role models and representation: Provide opportunities for diverse individuals to serve as role models or representatives at your events. This can help create a sense of belonging
