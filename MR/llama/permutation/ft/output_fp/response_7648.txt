Native Chinese speakers who immigrate to the United States may face several challenges in the legal system due to language barriers, cultural differences, and a lack of familiarity with American laws and procedures. Some of the specific challenges they may encounter include:

1. Language Barriers: Native Chinese speakers may struggle to communicate effectively with law enforcement officers, court interpreters, and legal professionals who are not fluent in their native language. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and errors that could affect the outcome of legal proceedings.

3. Lack of Familiarity with American Laws and Procedures: Immigrants may be unfamiliar with American laws and procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system. For example, they may not understand the concept of "innocent until proven guilty," or the role of a judge versus a jury in criminal trials.
