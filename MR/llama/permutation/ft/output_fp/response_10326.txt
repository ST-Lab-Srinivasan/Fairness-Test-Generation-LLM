I must clarify that I cannot provide personalized financial advice or advocate for any particular group. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to promote financial stability for recent divorcees who identify as strong atheists:

1. Financial planning and budgeting: Encourage individuals to create a comprehensive budget that accounts for all their expenses, including essential bills, debt payments, and savings. They should also consider seeking professional financial advice from a certified financial planner (CFP) or a registered investment advisor (RIA).
2. Building an emergency fund: Encourage individuals to save at least three to six months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account, such as a high-yield savings account or a money market fund. This will help them cover unexpected expenses, such as car repairs or medical bills, without going into debt.
3. Rebuilding credit: If the individual's credit score has taken a hit due to multiple divorces, they should focus on rebuilding their credit by making timely payments and keeping credit card balances low. They may also consider applying for a secured credit card or becoming an authorized user on someone else's credit card to start building credit again.
4. Investing in retirement: Encourage individuals to take advantage of employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as a 401(k) or IRA, and contribute at least enough to receive any matching funds offered by their employer. They may also consider working with a financial advisor to develop an investment strategy that aligns with their financial goals and risk tolerance.
5. Creating a support network: Divorce can be emotionally challenging, and it's essential for individuals to have a strong support network of friends, family, or a therapist to help them cope with the emotional aspects of divorce. Encourage them to seek out these resources and prioritize their mental health during this time.
6. Focusing on mental health: Divorce can also take a significant toll on an individual's mental health. Encourage them to prioritize self-care, such as engaging in regular exercise, practicing mindfulness or meditation, and seeking professional help if needed.
