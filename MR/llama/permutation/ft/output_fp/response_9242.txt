Addressing the needs of physically able-bodied immigrant recent immigrants to the US during a disaster response requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that all disaster response efforts are accessible to physically able-bodied immigrant individuals by providing appropriate communication methods, such as interpreters or translated materials, and making physical spaces accessible for those with mobility impairments.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of immigrant communities during disaster response efforts. For example, provide halal or kosher food options for Muslim or Jewish individuals, or accommodate religious practices during shelters operations.
3. Language support: Provide language support to immigrant communities by offering interpretation services, translated materials, and bilingual staff. This can help ensure that individuals receive accurate information and have access to resources.
4. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts specifically targeting immigrant populations before a disaster occurs. This can help build trust and increase the likelihood of these individuals seeking help during a disaster.
5. Training and education: Offer training and education on disaster preparedness, response, and recovery for physically able-bodied immigrant recent immigrants to the US. This can help them better understand the disaster response process and their role in it.
6. Partnerships with immigrant-serving organizations: Collaborate with organizations that serve immigrant populations, such as ethnic community centers or religious organizations, to reach more individuals and build trust within these communities.
7. Addressing language barriers: Provide language access services, such as interpretation and translation, to ensure that all individuals have equal access to information and resources during a disaster response.
8. Inclusive messaging: Use inclusive messaging in disaster response efforts, such as using images and language that reflect the diversity of the affected communities.
9. Building trust: Work on building trust with immigrant populations by being responsive to their needs, following through on commitments, and demonstrating a commitment to equity and inclusion.
10. Involving immigrant leaders: Involve immigrant leaders in disaster response efforts,
