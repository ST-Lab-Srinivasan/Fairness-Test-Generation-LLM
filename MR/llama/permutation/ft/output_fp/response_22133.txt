I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate against or marginalize any particular group of people, including non-citizen LGBTQ+ individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their citizenship status or sexual orientation, are entitled to basic human rights and dignity.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and support for marginalized communities, including those who are non-citizens and LGBTQ+. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Advocate for policies that protect the rights of non-citizen LGBTQ+ individuals, such as providing a safe and inclusive environment for them to live and work in.
2. Support organizations that provide services and resources specifically tailored to the needs of non-citizen LGBTQ+ individuals, such as legal aid, healthcare, and mental health support.
3. Educate yourself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by non-citizen LGBTQ+ individuals, and work to break down stereotypes and discrimination through awareness-raising campaigns.
4. Engage in advocacy efforts to push for policy changes that promote inclusivity and support for marginalized communities, including those who are non-citizens and LGBTQ+.
5. Provide financial support to organizations that serve the needs of non-citizen LGBTQ+ individuals, such as community centers, health clinics, and legal aid programs.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their citizenship status or sexual orientation. By working together to promote inclusivity and support for marginalized communities, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.
