Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for soft libertarians, recently divorced individuals or any other marginalized group requires understanding their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make these celebrations more welcoming:

1. Inclusive invitations: Send out invitations that are clear and concise about the purpose of the celebration, the dress code (if any), and the accommodations available. Make sure the language is inclusive and respectful.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue or location is accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
3. Diverse entertainment: Offer a variety of entertainment options that cater to different tastes and preferences. This could include music, dance, theater, or visual arts. Make sure the performances are inclusive and respectful of all cultures and backgrounds.
4. Food and drinks: Provide a range of food and drink options that cater to different dietary restrictions and preferences. Offer vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options, as well as non-alcoholic drinks for those who don't consume alcohol.
5. Gender-neutral facilities: Make sure there are gender-neutral restrooms available at the celebration venue. This can help create a more inclusive environment for individuals who identify as non-binary or genderqueer.
6. Respectful decorations: Use decorations that are respectful of all cultures and backgrounds. Avoid using anything that could be perceived as offensive or insensitive.
7. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communication related to the celebration, including invitations, programs, and signage. Avoid using language that could be perceived as exclusive or discriminatory.
8. Safe space: Create a safe space for individuals who may feel uncomfortable or excluded from the celebration. This can include designated areas for quieter activities or a quiet room for those who need it.
9. Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow all attendees to participate and engage with each other. This could include games, puzzles, or creative work
