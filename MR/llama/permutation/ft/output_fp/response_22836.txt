Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help make the experience more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and awareness for program staff and volunteers. This will help them understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of Asian participants and create a more inclusive environment.
2. Language support: Offer language support to participants who may need additional assistance in understanding Chinese culture and customs. This can be done through interpreters, translators, or bilingual staff members.
3. Cultural programming: Incorporate cultural programming that celebrates the diverse backgrounds of Asian participants. For example, include traditional dances, music, and art from different Asian cultures in the program.
4. Safe space creation: Create a safe and inclusive space for participants to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by establishing ground rules and expectations for behavior, and providing a supportive environment.
5. Inclusive marketing: Use language and imagery in marketing materials that are inclusive and respectful of Asian cultures. Avoid using stereotypes or perpetuating harmful representations of Asian people.
6. Partnership with Asian organizations: Collaborate with local Asian organizations to gain insight into the needs and preferences of Asian communities. This can help tailor programs to meet their specific cultural needs.
7. Community engagement: Engage with the local Asian community through outreach and outreach events. This can help build trust and create a sense of belonging among participants.
8. Flexibility in program design: Offer flexible program designs that cater to the diverse needs of Asian participants. For example, offer different levels of language classes or cultural programs based on participant's interests and needs.
9. Accessibility: Ensure that the program is accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or assistive technology.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate and solicit feedback from participants on the cultural programs. Use this information to make improvements and ensure that the program is inclusive and meeting the needs of all participants
