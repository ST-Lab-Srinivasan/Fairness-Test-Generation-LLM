There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by non-middle-class Nigerian individuals:

1. Poverty rates: According to the World Bank, in 2020, the poverty rate in Nigeria was around 40%. This means that nearly half of the population lives below the poverty line. Using data on poverty rates can help highlight the scale of the issue and the impact it has on non-middle-class individuals.
2. Income inequality: Data from the World Inequality Database shows that Nigeria has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world. This means that a small percentage of the population holds a significant portion of the country's wealth, while the majority struggle to make ends meet. Highlighting this issue through data can help bring attention to the challenges faced by non-middle-class individuals.
3. Access to education: Data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) shows that only around 60% of children in Nigeria attend primary school, and only around 30% attend secondary school. This highlights the lack of access to quality education for many non-middle-class individuals.
4. Health outcomes: Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that Nigeria has some of the highest rates of infant mortality and maternal mortality in the world. This highlights the challenges faced by non-middle-class individuals when it comes to accessing quality healthcare.
5. Housing conditions: Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that around 60% of Nigeria's population lives in urban areas, but many of these areas lack basic infrastructure such as paved roads, reliable electricity, and access to clean water. Highlighting the issue through data can help bring attention to the poor living conditions faced by non-middle-class individuals.
6. Employment rates: Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that unemployment rates in Nigeria are high, with around 20% of the population living in extreme poverty. This highlights the challenges faced by non-middle-class individuals when it comes to finding decent work and earning a living.
7. Gender inequality: Data from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP
