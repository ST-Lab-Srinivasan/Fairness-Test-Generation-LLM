4. Cultural competency training: Provide cultural competency training for election officials, poll workers, and community leaders to better understand the needs and experiences of Native American communities.
5. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to build trust and encourage participation among Native American populations. This can involve partnering with local organizations and community leaders to reach a wider audience.
6. Online resources: Create online resources, such as interactive maps and infographics, to help permanent residents learn about their voting rights and access election information.
7. Election protection: Train poll watchers and provide legal support to ensure that Native American voters are protected from discrimination or other forms of barriers at the polls.
8. Voting rights advocacy: Advocate for policies and laws that protect the voting rights of Native Americans, such as measures to prevent voter suppression or improve access to voting stations.
