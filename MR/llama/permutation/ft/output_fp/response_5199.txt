Ensuring the healthcare needs of marginalized populations, including those living in poverty in Mexico, requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various social, economic, and political factors. Here are some strategies that can help meet the healthcare needs of these communities:

1. Community-based healthcare: Set up clinics or health centers in marginalized areas, staffed by healthcare professionals who speak the local language and are familiar with the cultural norms of the community. These facilities should offer comprehensive primary care services, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and emergency care.
2. Mobile health clinics: Utilize mobile health clinics to reach remote or hard-to-reach areas, providing basic healthcare services and promoting health education in the local language. These clinics can also serve as a platform for outreach and engagement with community members.
3. Health promotion and disease prevention: Implement targeted health promotion and disease prevention programs, focusing on the most common health issues affecting marginalized communities. This may include initiatives to improve nutrition, increase physical activity, and reduce exposure to environmental hazards such as pollution or second-hand smoke.
4. Collaboration with local organizations: Work closely with local community organizations, such as civil society groups, religious organizations, and indigenous peoples' organizations, to reach marginalized populations and address their healthcare needs. These partnerships can help leverage local knowledge and resources to improve healthcare access and outcomes.
5. Addressing social determinants of health: Understand that health is influenced by a range of social determinants, including poverty, education, housing, and employment. Develop programs and policies that address these factors directly, such as microfinance initiatives, educational programs, and housing improvement schemes.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, or federal levels to address systemic barriers to healthcare access, including inadequate funding, lack of infrastructure, and discrimination. This may involve lobbying government officials, engaging in public campaigns, and building coalitions with other advocacy groups.
7. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for healthcare providers, community leaders
