Creating more inclusive community events for newly naturalized citizens aged 65 and older requires careful planning, consideration of their needs, and incorporation of their cultural backgrounds. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and engaging:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds of the seniors and design the event accordingly. This includes offering food, music, and activities that cater to their tastes and preferences. For example, if many of the seniors are from Asian cultures, provide Asian-inspired dishes and decorations.
