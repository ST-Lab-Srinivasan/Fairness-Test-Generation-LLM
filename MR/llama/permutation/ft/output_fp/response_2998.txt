Advocacy for veteran rights in Nigeria has been ongoing for several years, and there have been some successful campaigns and initiatives to raise awareness and improve the lives of veterans. Here are some examples:

1. Veterans' Empowerment Project (VEP): This project was launched in 2017 by the Nigerian Army Wives Association (NAWA) in collaboration with the Nigerian Navy Wives Association (NNWA) and the Air Force Wives Association (AFAW). The project aims to empower veterans through vocational training, mentorship, and entrepreneurial support.
2. Nigerian Veterans Trust Fund: Established in 2013, this trust fund provides financial assistance to veterans who are in need of medical attention, education, and other forms of support. The fund is managed by the Nigerian Army, and it has helped thousands of veterans access the care they need.
3. National Veterans Day: Since 2015, Nigeria has observed a National Veterans Day on November 11th to honor and recognize the contributions of veterans to the country's security and stability. The event brings together veterans, government officials, and civil society organizations to celebrate the achievements of veterans and promote their welfare.
4. Advocacy for mental health support: Mental health challenges are a significant issue among veterans in Nigeria, particularly those who have served in conflict zones. In 2018, the Nigerian Army Wives Association launched a mental health campaign to raise awareness of this issue and provide support to veterans struggling with PTSD and other mental health conditions.
5. Job creation initiatives: Several organizations, including the Nigerian Army Wives Association and the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), have launched job creation initiatives specifically for veterans. These programs aim to provide vocational training and employment opportunities to help veterans reintegrate into civilian life.
6. Advocacy for veteran-friendly policies: Civil society organizations, such as the Nigerian Veterans Association (NVA), have been advocating for policies that promote the welfare of veterans. These include legislation that grants veterans preferential treatment in employment and education, as well
