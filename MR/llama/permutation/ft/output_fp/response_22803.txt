As a non-recently widowed long-time veteran, you may face a number of challenges when entering the job market. Here are some potential issues to consider:

1. Ageism: As a veteran over the age of 50, you may face ageism in the workplace. Many employers have unconscious biases against older workers, assuming they will not be as productive or energetic as younger employees.
2. Limited job opportunities: With the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, many jobs that were once available to veterans may no longer exist. You may find yourself competing with younger, tech-savvy candidates for a limited number of positions.
3. Transferable skills: After spending years in the military, you may have developed a unique set of skills and experiences that are not easily transferable to civilian life. Employers may be hesitant to hire someone without direct civilian work experience, making it difficult to find a job that matches your qualifications.
4. Networking challenges: As a long-time veteran, you may have outdated connections or struggle to make new ones in the civilian world. This can limit your access to job opportunities and make it harder to get hired.
5. Difficulty adapting to civilian life: After serving in the military for an extended period, you may find it challenging to adjust to the pace of civilian life and the expectations of employers. This can lead to difficulties in finding and keeping a job.
