As a recruitment consultant, I have worked with several mid-50s temporary visa holders and have observed that they face unique challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges faced by this age group:

1. Ageism: Unfortunately, many employers tend to prefer younger candidates for jobs, especially in industries where youthful energy and enthusiasm are seen as key assets. As a result, mid-50s temporary visa holders may face discrimination or bias based on their age.
