To highlight the issues faced by beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers, we can use data from various sources, including language learning apps, surveys, and linguistic studies. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Language learning app data: Many language learning apps, such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone, provide usage data on their users. By analyzing this data, we can identify the most common mistakes made by beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers, as well as their progress over time. For example, we could track the frequency of errors related to verb conjugation, noun gender, or sentence structure.
2. Surveys: Conducting surveys among language learners can provide valuable insights into their experiences and challenges. We can ask questions about their level of proficiency, the difficulties they face when learning French or Spanish, and their preferred learning methods. This data can help us understand the common issues faced by beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers.

For example, studies have shown that beginner French speakers often struggle with the complex grammar and pronunciation rules of French, while native Spanish speakers may find it difficult to master the subtleties of French vocabulary and idiomatic expressions.
4. User-generated content: Analyzing user-generated content, such as language learning blogs or social media posts, can provide valuable insights into the challenges faced by beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers. By analyzing the language used in these sources, we can identify common mistakes, confusions, or areas of struggle.
5. Corpus analysis: Analyzing large datasets of texts in French and Spanish can help identify common patterns and trends in language use among beginner learners. For example, we could analyze a corpus of texts written by beginner French speakers to identify the most common grammatical errors or vocabulary mistakes.
6. User feedback: Analyzing user feedback from language learning platforms can provide valuable insights into the challenges faced by beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers. By analyzing user feedback, we can identify common issues, such as difficulty with grammar, pronunciation, or voc
