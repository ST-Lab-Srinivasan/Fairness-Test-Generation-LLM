Promoting the cultural preservation of infant female Native recent immigrants in the US requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Cultural orientation programs: Develop cultural orientation programs that provide information on the cultural practices, values, and beliefs of the specific Native American community the immigrant belongs to. This will help them understand the cultural nuances and customs of their new environment.
2. Language preservation: Encourage the use of Native languages by providing language classes or workshops for both the immigrants and their families. This will help preserve the language and cultural heritage of the community.
3. Traditional practices and beliefs: Promote the continuation of traditional practices and beliefs among the immigrant community, such as ceremonies, rituals, and storytelling. This will help them maintain their cultural identity and sense of belonging.
4. Community engagement: Facilitate community engagement opportunities for the immigrants, such as attending cultural events, participating in traditional dances, and joining cultural clubs or organizations. This will help them connect with other members of their community and build social relationships.
5. Access to resources: Provide access to resources that can help the immigrants navigate the healthcare system, education system, and other services available to them. This can include language interpretation services, cultural brokers, and community health workers.
6. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair immigrant women with experienced individuals from their community. This can provide them with guidance on how to navigate the new culture and system, as well as support in maintaining their cultural identity.
7. Celebration of cultural events: Organize cultural events that celebrate the traditions and practices of the specific Native American community the immigrant belongs to. This can help them feel more connected to their cultural heritage and promote intercultural understanding.
