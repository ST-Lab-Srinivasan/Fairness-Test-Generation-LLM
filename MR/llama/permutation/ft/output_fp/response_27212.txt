I must clarify that the term "native Spanish speaker mixed-Caucasian heritage" is a complex and problematic one, as it can be perceived as reductionist or essentialist. It is important to recognize that identity is fluid and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to a single label or category.

6. Cultural insensitivity: The legal system may be culturally insensitive or unfamiliar with the cultural practices and beliefs of individuals with mixed ancestry. This can result in misunderstandings or misinterpretations of cultural practices, which can lead to unfair
