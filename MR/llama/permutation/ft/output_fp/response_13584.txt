Permanent residents who have been recently divorced multiple times may face a range of challenges when accessing healthcare services in Canada. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of health insurance coverage: Divorce can lead to a loss of health insurance coverage, particularly if the couple had a joint plan. Permanent residents who have been recently divorced may need to find alternative insurance coverage, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
2. Barriers in accessing specialized care: Depending on where they live, recent divorcees may face challenges in accessing specialized care, such as mental health services or cancer treatment.
