Celebrating the cultural contributions of Native American recent immigrants to the US middle class can be done in various ways. Here are some suggestions:

1. Host Cultural Events: Organize cultural events such as powwows, traditional dances, and music performances to showcase the rich cultural heritage of Native Americans. These events can be attended by the local community, including middle-class people who may not be familiar with Native American culture.
2. Create an Interactive Museum Exhibit: Develop an interactive museum exhibit that showcases the history, traditions, and contributions of Native American communities. The exhibit can include artifacts, images, and multimedia displays that allow visitors to learn about Native American culture in a hands-on manner.
3. Support Native American Businesses: Encourage middle-class people to support Native American businesses by shopping at local stores owned by Native Americans or purchasing products made by Native American artisans. This can help to economically empower these communities and promote cultural exchange.
4. Provide Cultural Education: Offer workshops, lectures, or classes that teach middle-class people about Native American culture, history, and traditions. These educational programs can help to build bridges of understanding between different cultures and promote cross-cultural learning.
5. Celebrate Native American Holidays: Observe and celebrate traditional Native American holidays such as the Thanksgiving holiday, which is an opportunity for middle-class people to learn about and appreciate Native American culture.
6. Create a Mentorship Program: Develop a mentorship program that pairs middle-class individuals with Native American mentors who can share their knowledge and experiences of living in both cultures. This can help to promote cultural exchange, understanding, and mutual respect.
7. Film and Documentaries: Produce documentaries or films that highlight the cultural contributions of Native Americans to the US society. These media can help to raise awareness about Native American history, traditions, and struggles among middle-class people who may not be familiar with these issues.
8. Community Service Projects: Organize community service projects that bring together middle-class people and Native Americans to work on initiatives that benefit both communities. These projects can help to build bridges of understanding and promote cross-cultural collaboration.
