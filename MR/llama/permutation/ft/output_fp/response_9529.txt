Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting advanced age communities, particularly those with a high percentage of residents over the age of 85. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can contribute to these communities:

1. Social Connection: Volunteering provides opportunities for older adults to connect with their peers and community members, helping to combat loneliness and isolation. This is particularly important for those who may be experiencing the loss of a spouse or friends, or those who have mobility issues that limit their ability to leave their homes.
2. Skill Sharing: Many older adults have extensive experience and expertise in various areas, such as gardening, cooking, or crafting. Volunteering provides an opportunity for them to share these skills with others, particularly younger generations, and pass on their knowledge and wisdom.
3. Mental Stimulation: Engaging in volunteer work can help keep older adults' minds active and stimulated, reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Volunteering also provides an opportunity for social interaction, which is essential for maintaining mental health and well-being.
4. Physical Activity: Many volunteer opportunities involve physical activity, such as gardening, cleaning, or delivering meals. This can help older adults stay physically active, which is important for maintaining mobility and reducing the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.
5. Sense of Purpose: Volunteering provides older adults with a sense of purpose and meaning, which can be particularly important as they age. It helps them feel connected to their community and provides an opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of others.

7. Community Building: Volunteering helps build stronger, more cohesive communities by bringing people together around a shared goal or purpose. This can help create a sense of belonging and social capital, which is essential for maintaining mental and physical health in older adulthood.
8. Networking: Volunteering provides an opportunity for older adults to network with other
