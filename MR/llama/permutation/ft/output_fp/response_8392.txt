Preserving the cultural heritage of permanent resident communities, particularly those in their late teens (ages 18-19), is crucial for maintaining social cohesion and intergenerational relationships. Here are some strategies to promote cultural preservation in these communities:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Organize community events, workshops, and festivals that showcase the culture and traditions of the permanent resident community. Encourage participation from all members, including youth, and provide opportunities for them to share their experiences, music, dance, and art.
2. Cultural Education and Training: Offer cultural education programs, such as language classes, traditional craft workshops, and history lessons, specifically tailored to the needs of young people in these communities. This will help them understand and appreciate their cultural heritage better.

Joint initiatives can help build bridges and foster a sense of mutual respect and appreciation.
