Blue-collar workers in Nigeria, such as those in the informal sector or low-income jobs, often face significant challenges when interacting with the legal system. Some of the common challenges faced by blue-collar Nigerians in the legal system include:

1. Limited access to legal services: Blue-collar workers may not have the financial resources to hire a lawyer or access legal aid services, making it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
2. Lack of legal literacy: Many blue-collar workers may not have a good understanding of their legal rights and obligations, which can lead to them being taken advantage of or exploited by unscrupulous individuals or organizations.
3. Limited representation: Blue-collar workers may have limited access to legal representation, particularly in rural areas where there may be a lack of lawyers available to represent them.
4. Language barriers: In a country with over 250 languages spoken, blue-collar workers who do not speak the dominant language of the region they live in may face difficulties communicating with legal professionals and understanding the legal process.
5. Discrimination: Blue-collar workers may face discrimination based on their socio-economic status, race, ethnicity, or other factors, which can lead to unequal treatment under the law.
6. Limited access to justice: Blue-collar workers may have limited access to justice due to various factors such as poverty, lack of infrastructure, and corruption in the legal system.
7. Lack of trust: Blue-collar workers may not trust the legal system or lawyers due to past experiences of being taken advantage of or neglected by the system.
8. Limited knowledge of legal procedures: Blue-collar workers may have limited knowledge of legal procedures and processes, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
9. Difficulty in proving cases: Blue-collar workers may face challenges in proving their cases, particularly if they are up against well-funded and well-represented opponents.
10. Limited access to evidence: Blue-collar workers may have limited access to evidence and resources to build their case, which can make it difficult for them to prove their claims.
