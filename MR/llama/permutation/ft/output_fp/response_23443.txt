Mentorship can play a significant role in the development and well-being of Native American recent immigrants to the US, aged over 90 years old (and over 85). Here are some ways mentorship can benefit this population:

1. Cultural preservation and identity: Many Native American recent immigrants may have experienced cultural disruption and loss due to migration. A mentor can help them connect with their cultural heritage, preserve their traditional practices, and maintain a strong sense of identity.
2. Navigating healthcare systems: Older adults may face challenges navigating healthcare systems in the US, especially if they are not familiar with the language or cultural norms. A mentor can provide guidance on accessing healthcare services, understanding medical terminology, and advocating for their needs.
3. Building social connections: Older adults who have recently migrated to a new country may experience social isolation, which can negatively impact mental and physical health. A mentor can help them build social connections with other Native American individuals and communities, fostering a sense of belonging and support.
4. Navigating ageism and discrimination: Older adults may encounter ageism and discrimination in various settings, such as employment or housing. A mentor can provide emotional support and help them develop strategies to cope with these challenges.
5. Preserving traditional knowledge and skills: Many Native American elders have valuable traditional knowledge and skills that are at risk of being lost due to migration. A mentor can help them preserve these traditions by documenting their stories, sharing cultural practices, and passing on traditional skills to younger generations.
6. Advocating for rights and interests: Older adults may face discrimination or marginalization based on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status. A mentor can help them advocate for their rights and interests within their communities and beyond.
7. Building resilience: Migrating to a new country can be a stressful and challenging experience, particularly for older adults. A mentor can help them build resilience by sharing coping strategies and providing emotional support during difficult times.
8. Exploring new opportunities: Older adults may be interested in exploring new opportunities or pursuing new interests, but
