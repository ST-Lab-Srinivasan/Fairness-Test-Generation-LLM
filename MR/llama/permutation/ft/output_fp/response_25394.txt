As a beginner French speaker, newly married people may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common obstacles they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for beginner French speakers is the language barrier. They may struggle to communicate effectively in a professional setting, which can limit their career opportunities and potential growth.
