The impact of political affiliation on the lives of very old (90s+) native Spanish speakers can vary significantly, depending on a range of factors such as their personal beliefs and values, socioeconomic status, and the political climate in their area. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to healthcare: Older adults with strong political affiliations may have better access to healthcare services due to their social connections and networks within the political party. For example, members of a political party may be more likely to receive support from fellow party members in accessing healthcare services, such as medical care or disability benefits.
