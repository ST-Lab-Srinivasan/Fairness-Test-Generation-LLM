Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-time married beginner English speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or community. For individuals who have spent a significant amount of time married to a non-English speaker, their cultural heritage can influence how they perceive themselves and their place in the world.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage might shape the identities of long-time married beginner English speakers:
