Addressing the needs of individuals with unknown genetic conditions in disaster-affected areas can be challenging, particularly for those living just above the poverty line. However, there are several strategies that can be employed to help address their needs:

1. Community-based approaches: Involve local communities in the disaster response process by training them on basic first aid and triage techniques. This will help ensure that individuals with unknown genetic conditions receive appropriate care and support from people who understand their specific needs.
2. Mobile health clinics: Establish mobile health clinics that can reach remote areas where individuals with unknown genetic conditions may be living. These clinics can provide basic medical care, including screening and diagnosis, as well as linkages to specialized healthcare services.
3. Telemedicine: Utilize telemedicine technologies to connect individuals with unknown genetic conditions in disaster-affected areas with healthcare professionals who can provide remote consultations and support. This can be particularly useful for those living in remote or hard-to-reach areas.
4. Public education campaigns: Launch public education campaigns to raise awareness about the needs of individuals with unknown genetic conditions during disasters. This can help create a more inclusive response and ensure that these individuals receive the support they need.
5. Partnering with NGOs and community groups: Collaborate with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community groups that have experience working with individuals with genetic conditions. These partners can provide valuable expertise and resources to help address their needs during disaster response efforts.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, national, and international levels to better address the needs of individuals with unknown genetic conditions in disaster response. This may involve working with government agencies, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders to raise awareness about their specific needs and ensure that they are included in disaster response efforts.
7. Capacity building: Invest in capacity building programs for healthcare professionals and first responders to better understand the unique needs of individuals with unknown genetic conditions during disasters. This can help ensure that these individuals receive appropriate care and support during emergency situations.
8. Collaboration with academic institutions: Collaborate
