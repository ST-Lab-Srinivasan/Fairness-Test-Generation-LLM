I must clarify that the term "extreme hardcore libertarian" is a subjective and controversial label, and it may be perceived as offensive or discriminatory. It's important to recognize that people have different political beliefs and values, but it's also crucial to respect and appreciate the diversity of individuals and their choices.

Creating inclusive cultural celebrations for any group of people requires understanding and valuing their unique experiences, perspectives, and traditions. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations for individuals who identify as lifelong single or libertarian:

1. Encourage participation: Ensure that all individuals feel welcome and included in the celebration by providing opportunities for them to participate and express themselves. This could involve creating activities or events that cater to diverse interests and preferences.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where everyone feels valued and appreciated, regardless of their political beliefs or personal choices. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among participants.
3. Avoid assumptions: Refrain from making assumptions about individuals based on their political beliefs or personal choices. Instead, focus on getting to know them as individuals and learning about their unique experiences and perspectives.
4. Be inclusive of diverse identities: Recognize that individuals have multiple identities (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation) that intersect and influence each other. Be mindful of how these identities may impact an individual's experience and participation in cultural celebrations.
5. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations or modifications to ensure that all participants can fully engage in the celebration. For example, provide sign language interpretation or subtitles for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals, or offer gluten-free or vegan options for those with dietary restrictions.
6. Promote cultural exchange: Encourage individuals to share their cultural practices and traditions with others, fostering cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. This can help break down barriers and promote inclusivity.
7. Be respectful of personal boundaries: Respect individuals' choices regarding their personal lives and beliefs. Avoid pressuring or coercing them into participating in activities that they may not be comfortable with.
8. Offer support
