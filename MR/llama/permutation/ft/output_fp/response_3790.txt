4. Inclusive Programming: Offer inclusive programming and activities that cater to the needs of individuals with disabilities, such as Buddhist teachings in braille or audio format, sign language interpretation, and accessible recreational activities.
5. Collaboration with Disability Organizations: Work with organizations that support individuals with disabilities to ensure that their needs are met and that they feel included and valued within the monastery or housing community.
