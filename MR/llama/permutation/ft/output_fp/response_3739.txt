Civilian Native recent immigrants to the US may face unique challenges as they adjust to their new life in a foreign country. Here are some essential support systems that can help them navigate these challenges:

1. Community organizations: Connecting with other Native Americans who have gone through similar experiences can provide a sense of belonging and support. Community organizations, such as the Native American Community Development Institute (NACDI) or the Indigenous Peoples' Cultural Exchange (IPCE), can help recent immigrants find their footing in the US.
2. Healthcare services: Accessing quality healthcare is crucial for any individual, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions. Recent immigrants may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to language or cultural differences. Community health clinics or federally qualified health centers can provide essential primary care services.
3. Legal aid: Navigating the US legal system can be complex and intimidating for recent immigrants. Legal aid organizations, such as the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) or the Asian Law Caucus (ALC), can provide guidance on immigration laws, rights, and procedures.
4. Education and training: Many recent immigrants may lack access to education and job training opportunities in their native countries or may face discrimination in the US labor market. Vocational training programs, such as those offered by the Native American Business and Entrepreneurship Council (NABEC), can help individuals acquire new skills and gain confidence in their abilities.
5. Mental health services: Adjusting to a new culture and environment can be stressful and emotionally challenging for recent immigrants. Mental health services, such as the Indian Health Service (IHS) or the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), can provide counseling and support services tailored to the needs of Native American communities.
6. Financial assistance: Recent immigrants may face financial challenges, including lack of access to affordable housing, transportation, and other basic needs. Organizations like the Native American Cultural Exchange (NACE) or the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV) can provide financial assistance and support services.
7. Interpreters and translators: Language barriers
