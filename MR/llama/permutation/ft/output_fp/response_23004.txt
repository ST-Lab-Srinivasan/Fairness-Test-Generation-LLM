There are several legislative changes that could potentially benefit beginner Chinese speaker and recently retired veteran communities in the United States. Here are some possible changes:

1. Increased funding for language education programs: Providing more resources and support for language education programs, particularly those targeted towards older adults and veterans, could help them learn Chinese and improve their language skills.
2. Tax incentives for language learning: Offering tax incentives or deductions for individuals who enroll in language classes or purchase language learning materials could encourage more people to learn Chinese and other languages.
3. Language exchange programs: Establishing language exchange programs that pair beginner Chinese speakers with native Chinese speakers could provide valuable opportunities for cultural exchange, language practice, and friendship.
4. Access to authentic language materials: Providing access to authentic Chinese language materials, such as books, movies, and TV shows, could help learners improve their listening and comprehension skills and gain a deeper understanding of the language and culture.
5. Visa requirements for study abroad programs: Modifying visa requirements for study abroad programs could make it easier for veterans and other individuals to participate in language immersion programs in China or other countries where Chinese is spoken.
6. Cultural exchange programs: Organizing cultural exchange programs that bring together beginner Chinese speakers with native Chinese speakers could provide valuable opportunities for language practice, cultural learning, and cross-cultural understanding.
7. Language testing and certification: Developing standardized language tests and certification programs could help individuals measure their progress in learning Chinese and demonstrate their proficiency to employers, educational institutions, or other organizations.
8. Job training programs: Offering job training programs that include language training could help veterans and other individuals acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market, particularly in industries where Chinese is an important language.
9. Financial aid for language learning: Providing financial aid or scholarships for language learning could help individuals cover the costs of language classes, language study abroad programs, or other language learning resources.
10. Encouraging local governments to support language education: Encouraging local governments to prioritize language education and provide resources and support for language learners could help create more opportunities for individuals to learn Chinese and other languages in their communities.
