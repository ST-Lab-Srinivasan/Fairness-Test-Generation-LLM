Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recent immigrants to the US, including partially asexual individuals, requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Include diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural celebration reflects the diversity of the community by including representations of different cultures, religions, sexual orientations, and gender identities.
2. Provide accommodations for non-binary and asexual individuals: Offer options for non-binary and asexual individuals, such as providing gender-neutral restrooms or having an "opt-out" option for sexual orientation and gender identity surveys.
3. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by recent immigrants, including those who are partially asexual. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy.
4. Create safe spaces: Designate areas where individuals can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could include creating gender-neutral spaces or hosting events specifically for non-binary and asexual individuals.
5. Involve the community in planning: Engage with the local immigrant community to co-create cultural celebrations that are inclusive and representative of their experiences. Encourage feedback and suggestions from participants to ensure the event is welcoming and respectful.
6. Offer alternative participation options: Provide alternatives for individuals who may not want to participate in traditional cultural celebration activities, such as watching from a distance or participating in a support role (e.g., volunteering).
7. Address language barriers: Provide translation services or interpretive support to ensure that all participants can fully engage with the cultural celebration, regardless of their language proficiency.
8. Foster a culture of respect: Encourage participants to be mindful of each other's differences and to treat everyone with kindness and dignity. Provide resources for individuals who may need support navigating cultural differences.
9. Be open to feedback and adaptation: Continuously gather feedback from participants and make adjustments as needed to ensure the cultural celebration remains inclusive and welcoming.
10. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the value of diversity in the cultural celebration, highlighting the unique contributions
