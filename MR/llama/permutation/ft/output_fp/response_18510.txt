Older Chinese individuals encounter several difficulties when using the medical care system as 90-plus year-old native speakers. Some of these obstacles include:

1. Language Barrier: Older generations may have difficulty expressing themselves due to linguistic limitations, making it challenging for healthcare providers to understand their needs and provide appropriate treatment.
