It is important to recognize that the experiences of African Americans in the healthcare system can vary greatly based on a range of factors, including socioeconomic status, access to care, and cultural background. Here are some challenges that progressive ethnically full African Americans may face in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to culturally competent care: Progressive ethnically full African Americans may face barriers in accessing healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about their cultural practices and beliefs. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, or inappropriate treatment.
2. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in the healthcare system, particularly against marginalized communities. Progressive ethnically full African Americans may face discrimination from healthcare providers, which can lead to a lack of trust and confidence in the healthcare system.
