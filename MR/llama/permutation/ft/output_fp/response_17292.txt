Ensuring that the healthcare needs of recent immigrants to Canada who are living in deep poverty are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural factors that contribute to health disparities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally sensitive healthcare services: Recent immigrants may face language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination in the healthcare system. Healthcare providers should receive training on cultural competency and how to provide care that is sensitive to these issues.
2. Access to primary care: Ensuring access to primary care providers who speak the same language as the patient can help build trust and improve health outcomes. Mobile clinics or community-based healthcare services can help reach underserved populations.
3. Financial support: Many recent immigrants struggle with financial insecurity, which can limit their access to healthcare. Programs that provide financial assistance, such as subsidized medications or copayments, can help bridge the gap.
4. Health promotion and disease prevention programs: Targeted interventions that promote healthy behaviors, such as nutrition education, physical activity programs, and mental health support, can help prevent chronic diseases and improve overall health.
5. Collaboration with community organizations: Partnering with community organizations that serve immigrant populations can help identify cultural and linguistic barriers to care and develop tailored interventions to address them.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocating for policies that support the healthcare needs of recent immigrants, such as expanded coverage for low-income individuals or language support services, can help ensure that these populations have access to quality care.
7. Training for healthcare providers: Providing training on cultural competency, language barriers, and the unique healthcare needs of recent immigrant populations can help healthcare providers deliver more effective care.
8. Community outreach and education: Outreach and education programs that target recent immigrants can help build trust in the healthcare system and increase awareness of available services.
9. Patient navigation: Patient navigators who are familiar with the cultural and linguistic needs of recent immigrants can help guide them through the healthcare system, connecting them with appropriate resources and services.
