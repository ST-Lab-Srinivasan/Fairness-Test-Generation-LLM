Addressing the specific needs of Native natural-born US citizen active-duty individuals in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some recommendations for educators and policymakers to address the specific needs of this population:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native natural-born US citizen active-duty individuals have faced historical trauma and ongoing discrimination, which can affect their educational outcomes. Educators must be trained in culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge and respect the cultural backgrounds of these students.
