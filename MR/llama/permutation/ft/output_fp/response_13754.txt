There are many successful community initiatives led by beginner French speakers who are not part of the middle class. Here are a few examples:

1. Language exchange programs: Many beginners have started language exchange programs in their communities, where they meet with native French speakers to practice their language skills and help others improve their English. These programs are often organized through local libraries, community centers, or online platforms.
2. Cultural events: Beginners may organize cultural events, such as film screenings, concerts, or exhibitions, to share French culture with their communities. These events can be a great way to meet other language learners and practice speaking in a fun setting.
3. Volunteer work: Many beginners have volunteered for local organizations or charities, where they use their language skills to help others. This can include working at a soup kitchen, helping at a homeless shelter, or participating in other community service projects.
4. Language learning podcasts: Some beginners have started language learning podcasts, where they share tips, resources, and cultural insights with listeners. These podcasts can be a great way to connect with other learners and practice speaking.
5. Online communities: Many beginners have created online communities or forums for language learners, where they can share their experiences, ask questions, and practice speaking with other learners. These communities can be a valuable resource for beginners who want to connect with others and improve their language skills.
6. Language learning apps: Some beginners have developed language learning apps, such as Duolingo or Babbel, which provide interactive lessons and exercises for language learners. These apps can be a great way to practice speaking and listening in a fun and engaging way.
7. Cultural immersion programs: Beginners may participate in cultural immersion programs, where they live with a French family or spend time in France to immerse themselves in the language and culture. These programs can be a great way to improve language skills and gain cultural insight.
8. Language exchange tours: Some beginners have organized language exchange tours, where they travel to France or other French-speaking countries to practice their language skills with native speakers. These tours can be a great way to immerse oneself in the language and culture, while also meeting other learners and practicing speaking.
