It is important to recognize that the experiences of individuals within a particular racial or ethnic group can vary greatly based on a range of factors, including socioeconomic status, access to resources and opportunities, and systemic forms of oppression. Therefore, it is not appropriate to make generalizations about the challenges faced by "not high-income professional mixed-Caucasian heritage people" in the healthcare system.

However, it is important to acknowledge that there are specific challenges faced by individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic groups within the healthcare system, including:

1. Discrimination and bias: Studies have shown that individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic groups may face discrimination and bias within the healthcare system, which can result in delayed or inadequate care, and poorer health outcomes.
2. Language barriers: Individuals who are non-native English speakers may face language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnoses.
3. Cultural insensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the cultural beliefs and practices of individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic groups, which can result in inappropriate or insensitive care.
4. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the patient population, leading to a lack of representation and understanding of the specific needs and experiences of marginalized communities.
5. Limited access to resources: Individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic groups may face barriers to accessing healthcare resources, including transportation, childcare, and linguistic interpretation services, which can hinder their ability to receive appropriate care.
6. Stigma and shame: Individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic groups may experience stigma and shame related to their race or ethnicity, which can impact their willingness to seek medical care or disclose sensitive information to healthcare providers.
7. Health disparities: Individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic groups may face health disparities due to a range of factors, including limited access to healthy food options, inadequate housing, and exposure to environmental toxins.
