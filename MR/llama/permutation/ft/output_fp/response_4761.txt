Not upper-middle-income immigrants to the US face significant challenges in accessing and affording quality healthcare. Here are some of the main challenges they encounter:

1. Language barriers: Many immigrants, especially those from non-English-speaking countries, face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers due to language barriers. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and delayed care.
2. Cultural differences: Immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices regarding healthcare, which can sometimes clash with the US healthcare system. For example, some cultures may prioritize traditional healing methods over Western medicine.
3. Limited access to health insurance: Many immigrants are uninsured or underinsured due to their immigration status or lack of access to affordable health insurance options. This can limit their ability to receive preventive care, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment of chronic conditions.
4. Cost barriers: Even for those with health insurance, out-of-pocket costs, co-pays, and deductibles can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for low-income immigrants. This can result in delayed or forgone care.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Immigrants may experience discrimination and stigma based on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status, which can affect their willingness to seek healthcare services.
6. Lack of trust: Some immigrants may not trust the US healthcare system due to past experiences or cultural beliefs, leading them to delay or avoid seeking care.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Immigrants may face difficulties accessing specialized care, such as mental health services or complex surgeries, due to language barriers, limited knowledge of the healthcare system, or lack of access to specialists.
8. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The US healthcare system can be complex and confusing, particularly for those who are not familiar with it. Immigrants may struggle to navigate the system, leading to delays or missed opportunities for care.
9. Limited access to preventive services: Some immigrants may have limited access to preventive services, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations
