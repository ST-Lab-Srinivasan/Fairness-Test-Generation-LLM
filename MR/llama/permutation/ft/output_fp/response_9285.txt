Moderate native Arabic speakers may face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system (usually English or French), navigating the legal process can be difficult. They may struggle to understand court proceedings, legal documents, and other important information.
