As a native French speaker and an Indian citizen, you may face various challenges in the legal system in India. Here are some of the common issues that you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: India has a diverse population, and English is not everyone's first language. As a French speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal officials who are not fluent in French. While many courts in India offer interpretation services, there may be instances where communication becomes challenging.
