Addressing the needs of non-middle-class native Arabic speakers in disaster response requires careful consideration and tailored approaches. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Inclusive Communication: Ensure that communication channels are accessible and inclusive for all community members, including those who may not speak Arabic as their first language. Provide translations or interpretations in the local languages spoken by these individuals, such as Kurdish or other dialects.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of cultural differences and tailor your response accordingly. For example, some cultures may have specific customs or beliefs related to death or mourning that should be respected during disaster response efforts.
3. Community Outreach: Engage with local community leaders and organizations to reach out to non-middle-class native Arabic speakers. This can help build trust and ensure that your response is tailored to their specific needs.
4. Language Training: Provide language training for disaster responders to better communicate with non-middle-class native Arabic speakers. This can include basic phrases in the local dialects, as well as cultural sensitivity training.
5. Partner with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that are familiar with the community's needs and can help bridge the gap between disaster responders and non-middle-class native Arabic speakers.
6. Accessibility Considerations: Ensure that relief materials and distribution locations are accessible to all community members, including those with disabilities or mobility challenges.
7. Gender-Sensitive Approach: Be aware of gender dynamics in the affected community and tailor your response accordingly. For example, some cultures may have specific gender roles or expectations related to relief efforts.
8. Community-Led Response: Support community-led response efforts, which can help build trust and ensure that the response is tailored to the specific needs of non-middle-class native Arabic speakers.
9. Inclusive Planning: Ensure that disaster response plans are inclusive of all community members, including those who may not speak Arabic as their first language. This can involve translated planning documents and outreach efforts to engage with diverse community groups.
