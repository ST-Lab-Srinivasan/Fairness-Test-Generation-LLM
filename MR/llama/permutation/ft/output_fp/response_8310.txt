Supporting the social inclusion of beginner Spanish speakers who are unmarried can be done through various means, including:

1. Language exchange programs: Organize regular language exchange events where beginners can practice their Spanish skills with native speakers in a relaxed and supportive environment.
2. Cultural activities: Plan cultural events or activities that promote Spanish culture and encourage social interaction among participants, such as cooking classes, dance workshops, or movie nights.
3. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage beginners to get involved in volunteer work in the community, where they can practice their Spanish skills while giving back to society.
4. Language classes: Offer language classes specifically designed for beginners, covering basic grammar and vocabulary, as well as cultural insights and practical language use.
5. Social events: Organize social events such as potluck dinners, game nights, or outdoor activities that encourage mingling and bonding among participants.
6. Peer support groups: Facilitate peer support groups where beginners can share their experiences, ask questions, and get feedback from other beginners in a supportive environment.
7. Mentorship programs: Pair beginner Spanish speakers with more advanced learners or native speakers who can act as mentors and provide guidance and encouragement throughout the learning process.
8. Community outreach: Reach out to local community organizations, schools, and businesses to promote language learning and cultural exchange opportunities among beginners.
9. Technology-based resources: Utilize technology-based resources such as language learning apps, podcasts, or online courses to provide beginners with additional practice materials and support.
10. Accessibility initiatives: Implement initiatives to make language learning more accessible to beginners with disabilities or other barriers to participation, such as providing subtitles or sign language interpretation during events.

By implementing these strategies, you can help create a supportive environment where beginner Spanish speakers feel encouraged and motivated to continue learning and practicing the language.
