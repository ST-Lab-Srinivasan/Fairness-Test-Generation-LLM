Creating more inclusive cultural events for actively partially identifying as non-binary identifying ultra-conservative individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your event more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Understand the individual's identity: It is essential to respect and recognize the individual's identity, including their gender identity. Use their preferred pronouns and avoid making assumptions about their identity.
2. Be aware of cultural sensitivities: Ultra-conservative individuals may have specific cultural practices or beliefs that are important to them. Be sensitive to these cultural nuances and make accommodations as needed.
3. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that the event has gender-neutral restrooms or provide private options for individuals who may feel uncomfortable using a shared bathroom.
4. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is binary or assumes a specific gender identity. Instead, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all genders.
5. Offer gender-neutral attire options: Provide clothing options that are inclusive of all genders, such as gender-neutral dresses or pants.
6. Be mindful of body diversity: Recognize that not everyone may conform to societal beauty standards, and be respectful of individuals' bodies. Avoid making assumptions about someone's identity based on their appearance.
7. Foster a safe space: Create an environment where individuals feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage open dialogue and respectful communication.
8. Involve non-binary individuals in the planning process: Engage with non-binary individuals in the planning process to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account. This can help create a more inclusive event for everyone.
9. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials or resources that provide an understanding of non-binary identities, as well as the challenges and discrimination they may face.
10. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the power dynamics at play in cultural events, particularly those that involve marginalized communities. Take steps to address these imbalances and create a more equitable environment.
