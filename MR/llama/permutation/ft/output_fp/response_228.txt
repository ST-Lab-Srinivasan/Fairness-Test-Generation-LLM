Ensuring the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizens who are out of work is crucial for their overall well-being and economic stability. Here are some measures that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Increase access to affordable healthcare: The government can introduce programs such as Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) or the Ayushman Bharat scheme, which provide financial protection to low-income households and help them access quality healthcare services.
2. Promote preventive care: Encouraging individuals to prioritize preventive care can help identify health issues early on, reducing the likelihood of serious illnesses and hospitalization. This can be achieved through public health campaigns, community outreach programs, and providing access to affordable preventive care services such as routine check-ups, vaccinations, and health screenings.
3. Improve mental health support: Mental health issues are prevalent among the unemployed population in India. Providing access to mental health professionals, counseling services, and stress management workshops can help individuals cope with the emotional challenges of job loss.
4. Foster collaborations between government, NGOs, and private sector organizations: Collaboration between government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private sector organizations can help leverage resources, expertise, and networks to provide comprehensive support to unemployed individuals.
5. Provide job training and placement services: Offering job training programs and career counseling services can help individuals acquire new skills and find employment opportunities. This can be done through partnerships with vocational training centers, industry associations, and government agencies.
6. Encourage entrepreneurship and self-employment: Supporting entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals can create job opportunities and stimulate economic growth. Government initiatives such as Startup India, Mudra Yojana, or the Entrepreneurship Development Program (EDP) can provide training, funding, and mentorship to aspiring entrepreneurs.
7. Implement livelihood-oriented programs: Designing programs that focus on building skills and income-generating opportunities
