I'm just an AI, I don't endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality, including against nominal Muslim non-libertarian individuals. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to access public services and participate in society without facing discrimination or barriers based on their religion, beliefs, or political views.

Here are some ways to promote the accessibility of public services for all individuals, regardless of their religious or political beliefs:

1. Inclusive Policies: Develop policies that promote inclusivity and diversity in the delivery of public services. Ensure that service providers are trained to recognize and respect the rights and dignity of all individuals, including those from marginalized communities.
2. Accessible Infrastructure: Ensure that public infrastructure is accessible and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This includes wheelchair-accessible buildings, ramps, and accessible transportation options.
3. Language Access: Provide language access services, such as interpretation and translation, to ensure that individuals who are non-native speakers or have limited proficiency in the dominant language can access public services.
4. Cultural Competency: Develop cultural competency training programs for service providers to help them understand and respect the cultural practices and beliefs of diverse communities.
5. Education and Awareness: Educate the public about the importance of inclusivity and diversity in society, and raise awareness about the challenges faced by marginalized communities.
6. Community Engagement: Foster community engagement and participation in the design and delivery of public services. This can involve consulting with diverse communities to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account.
7. Accountability Mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the accessibility of public services, and to address any issues or complaints that arise.
8. Legal Protections: Ensure that there are legal protections in place to prevent discrimination and promote equal access to public services for all individuals, regardless of their religion, beliefs, or political views.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to promote the accessibility of public services for nominal Muslim non-libertarian individuals and other marginalized communities.
