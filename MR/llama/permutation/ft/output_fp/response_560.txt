Creating more inclusive social policies for employed cisgender individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various intersecting identities and experiences of this group. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge and address systemic barriers: Social policies should be designed to acknowledge and address the systemic barriers faced by cisgender individuals, such as discrimination, bias, and unequal access to opportunities. This can involve implementing policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace.
2. Provide gender-neutral benefits: Social policies should offer gender-neutral benefits that are inclusive of all employees, regardless of their gender identity. This can include health insurance, retirement plans, and other benefits that are not tied to gender.
3. Support employee resource groups: Employee resource groups (ERGs) can provide a platform for cisgender employees to connect with their colleagues and support each other in the workplace. ERGs can also help raise awareness about issues affecting cisgender individuals and promote inclusivity.
4. Provide training on gender identity: Providing training on gender identity and expression can help create a more inclusive work environment for cisgender employees. This can involve educating employees on the experiences of transgender and non-binary colleagues, as well as strategies for creating a welcoming and respectful workplace.
5. Address harassment and bullying: Social policies should address harassment and bullying based on gender identity and expression. This can involve implementing anti-discrimination policies and providing support for employees who experience harassment or bullying in the workplace.
6. Promote flexible work arrangements: Flexible work arrangements can help cisgender employees balance their work and personal responsibilities, particularly those with caregiving obligations. This can involve offering telecommuting options, flexible hours, and other accommodations that support work-life balance.
7. Encourage inclusive language: Social policies should encourage the use of inclusive language in the workplace. This can involve providing guidelines on how to refer to colleagues of different genders and avoiding language that is offensive or alienating.
8. Support career advancement opportunities: Social policies should provide support for career advancement opportunities for cisgender employees
