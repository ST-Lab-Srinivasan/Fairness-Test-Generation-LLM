I must clarify that the term "extreme soft libertarian" is not a recognized legal or political terminology, and it is not clear what this term encompasses. However, I will provide some general information on the challenges faced by native Arabic speakers in the legal system, particularly those who identify as libertarians.

1. Language barriers: One of the biggest challenges faced by native Arabic speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Legal documents and proceedings are often conducted in a language other than Arabic, such as English or French, which can make it difficult for Arabic speakers to fully comprehend the legal process.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in many countries is based on Western legal traditions, which may not be in line with the cultural and religious values of native Arabic speakers. For example, some libertarians may have different views on the role of religion in the legal system, which can create tensions when interacting with legal systems that are based on secular principles.
3. Lack of representation: Native Arabic speakers may face challenges in accessing legal representation due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can lead to a lack of understanding of their rights and responsibilities within the legal system, which can result in unfair outcomes.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, native Arabic speakers may face discrimination within the legal system based on their race, ethnicity, or language. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of trust in the legal system as a whole.
5. Limited access to legal resources: In some countries, native Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, research facilities, or legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult for them to prepare their cases or advocate for their rights within the legal system.
6. Difficulty navigating complex legal procedures: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with its intricacies. Native Arabic speakers may face additional challenges in understanding and complying with legal procedures, which can lead to confusion or errors.
7. Limited knowledge of legal terminology: Legal terminology can be foreign to native Arabic speakers, making it difficult for them to understand legal documents or communicate effectively with legal profession
