Promoting the inclusion of moderate early pregnancy (1st trimester) individuals in casual athletics requires a thoughtful and supportive approach. Here are some strategies to help create a welcoming environment:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide information and resources on prenatal exercise, nutrition, and mental health to help expectant mothers make informed decisions about their physical activity levels.
