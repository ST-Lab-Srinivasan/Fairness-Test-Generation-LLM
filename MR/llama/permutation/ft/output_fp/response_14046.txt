Creating more inclusive public spaces for small-government advocate native English speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target group: It is essential to understand the specific needs and preferences of small-government advocate native English speakers when designing public spaces for them. This can involve conducting surveys, focus groups, or interviews to gather data on their requirements and expectations.
2. Provide accessible and affordable amenities: Small-government advocates may have limited financial resources, so it is crucial to provide accessible and affordable amenities in public spaces. This can include things like benches, picnic tables, and restrooms that are easily accessible and free or low-cost.
3. Promote inclusivity through design: The design of public spaces should promote inclusivity by incorporating elements that appeal to a wide range of people. For example, using universal design principles, such as providing multiple entry points, avoiding clutter, and using clear signage, can make public spaces more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
4. Create opportunities for social interaction: Small-government advocates may have limited opportunities to interact with others outside of their social circles.

This can be achieved by hosting public debates, organizing political events, or providing access to resources and information that support their advocacy efforts.
6. Foster a sense of community: Small-government advocates may feel disconnected from their communities due to their political beliefs. Public spaces can help foster a sense of community by promoting social connections, shared experiences, and a sense of belonging among users.
