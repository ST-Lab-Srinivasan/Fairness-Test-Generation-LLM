Moderate mixed African American individuals may face unique challenges within the healthcare system, including:

1. Misdiagnosis or inaccurate treatment: Because of their racial identity, they may be misdiagnosed or receive inadequate treatment. For example, a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that African American patients were more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with somnambulism (sleepwalking) rather than the underlying medical condition.
2. Bias and discrimination: Moderate mixed African Americans may encounter bias and discrimination from healthcare providers, which can lead to mistrust and decreased adherence to treatment recommendations. A study published in the Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved found that African American patients were less likely than white patients to receive appropriate care for chronic conditions due to perceived discrimination.
3. Limited access to culturally competent care: Moderate mixed African Americans may have limited access to healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about their cultural background and can provide culturally competent care. A study published in the Journal of Transcultural Nursing found that African American patients were more likely than white patients to experience language barriers and have difficulty finding healthcare providers who could communicate effectively with them.
4. Difficulty navigating complex healthcare systems: Moderate mixed African Americans may face challenges navigating the complex healthcare system, particularly if they lack a support system or are unfamiliar with the medical lingo used by healthcare providers. A study published in the Journal of Healthcare Management found that African American patients were more likely than white patients to experience difficulties navigating the healthcare system due to a lack of knowledge about available resources and treatment options.
5. Inadequate pain management: Moderate mixed African Americans may encounter inadequate pain management, particularly if they are perceived as "non-compliant" or "drug seekers." A study published in the Journal of Pain Research found that African American patients were less likely than white patients to receive adequate pain management for chronic non-cancer pain.
6. Limited access to genetic testing and counseling: Moderate mixed African Americans may have limited access to genetic testing and
