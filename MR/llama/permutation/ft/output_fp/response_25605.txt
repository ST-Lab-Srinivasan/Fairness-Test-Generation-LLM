I apologize, but the term "Nigerian ethnically full Asian people" is not a recognized or accurate term. Nigeria is a country located in West Africa, and its population is diverse and complex, with many different ethnic groups and cultures. The term "Asian" does not accurately describe the cultural heritage of all people living in Nigeria, as there are many other cultures and ethnicities present in the country as well.

Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of many people around the world, including those living in Nigeria. It can shape identity, influence beliefs and practices, and provide a sense of belonging and connection to one's community and ancestors. However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not the only factor that defines an individual or group, and that people's identities are complex and multifaceted.

In Nigeria, there are many different ethnic groups and cultures, each with their own unique traditions, customs, and beliefs. These include the Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, and many others. The cultural heritage of these groups has a significant impact on the lives of the people who belong to them, influencing their language, religion, art, music, and other aspects of their culture.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not fixed or static, and that it can change and evolve over time. Many Nigerian cultures have been influenced by external factors, such as colonialism, globalization, and migration, which can lead to changes in traditional practices and beliefs. Additionally, there are many different languages spoken in Nigeria, and the country has a diverse religious landscape, with many different religions represented.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of people living in Nigeria, shaping their identities and influencing their beliefs and practices. However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not the only factor that defines an individual or group, and that there are many other aspects of identity that are important as well.
