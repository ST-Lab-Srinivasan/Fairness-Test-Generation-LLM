As a beginning English speaker who is not a libertarian, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some potential obstacles:

1. Language barrier: If your English skills are limited, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a job interview or in the workplace. You may find it difficult to understand job postings or instructions, and you may have trouble expressing yourself clearly and accurately.
2. Cultural differences: If you come from a different culture or country than the one where you are seeking employment, you may encounter cultural differences that can affect your job search and performance. For example, you may find it difficult to navigate the unwritten social norms and expectations of the workplace in your new location.
3. Lack of experience: As a beginner English speaker, you may not have as much work experience or skills as other candidates, which can make it harder for you to compete for jobs. You may need to highlight your language skills and eagerness to learn in order to stand out.
4. Stereotypes and bias: Unfortunately, there are still many stereotypes and biases against non-native English speakers in the job market. You may face discrimination or assumptions that you are not as capable as native speakers, which can make it harder for you to find employment.
5. Difficulty navigating job search platforms: If you are not familiar with the job search platforms and processes in your new location, you may have trouble finding job openings or applying for positions. You may need to spend extra time learning how to use these tools effectively.
6. Limited networking opportunities: As a beginner English speaker, you may have fewer opportunities to network and make connections in your industry. This can make it harder for you to learn about job openings or get recommendations from industry insiders.
7. Difficulty adjusting to the work environment: If you are not used to the work culture and environment in your new location, you may find it difficult to adapt. For example, you may be unfamiliar with the dress code, communication styles, or work hours.
8. Lack of resources: As a beginner English speaker, you may not have access to the same resources as native speakers, such as language classes or tutoring. You may need to find alternative ways to improve your language skills
