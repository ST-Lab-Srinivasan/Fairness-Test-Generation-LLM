Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers among mixed African-American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make the experience more welcoming and accessible:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for the program staff and volunteers to help them understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the participants. This will enable them to create a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.
2. Language instruction tailored to mixed racial identities: Design language instruction that caters to the unique needs of mixed African-American individuals. For example, you could provide materials and activities that reflect their cultural backgrounds and experiences.
3. Inclusive programming: Develop programming that incorporates diverse cultures and perspectives. This could include events, workshops, or activities that celebrate Chinese culture while also acknowledging the participants' mixed racial identities.
4. Safe space creation: Establish a safe and welcoming space for participants to learn and interact with each other. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among participants of different backgrounds.
5. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with local community organizations that serve mixed African-American populations to promote the cultural program and reach a broader audience. This can help create a more inclusive environment and attract a diverse range of participants.
6. Outreach and marketing strategies: Develop outreach and marketing strategies tailored to the needs and preferences of mixed African-American individuals. Utilize various channels, such as social media, flyers, and word of mouth, to promote the program and attract a diverse range of participants.
7. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the diverse schedules and needs of participants. This could include evening or weekend classes, as well as online or hybrid programs for those with busy schedules.
8. Accessibility and accommodations: Ensure that the program is accessible and inclusive for all participants. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or modified materials for those with disabilities.
9. Celebrating diversity: Emphasize the importance of cultural diversity and inclusivity throughout the program. Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives, and provide opportunities for intercultural exchange
