Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-socialist native Arabic speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that considers their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive public spaces:

1. Language Accessibility: Ensure that all public space signage, materials, and communications are available in the native language of the Arabic speaker community. This includes translating important documents, providing interpretation services, and using visual aids to communicate information.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and customs when designing and maintaining public spaces. For example, provide separate areas for gender segregation in accordance with local laws and customs. Also, ensure that any artwork or installations reflect the local culture and are inclusive of all communities.
3. Accessibility Features: Incorporate accessibility features into public spaces to make them more accessible to individuals with disabilities. This includes wheelchair ramps, elevators, Braille signage, and audio signals for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
4. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement by providing opportunities for feedback and input from the Arabic speaker community. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, and public consultations to ensure that their needs and preferences are considered in the design and maintenance of public spaces.
5. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness campaigns to promote cultural sensitivity and understanding among the broader community. This can include workshops, training sessions, and public events that celebrate the diversity of the Arabic speaker community.
6. Inclusive Design: Ensure that public spaces are designed with inclusivity in mind. For example, provide seating areas that are accessible to individuals with mobility impairments, and incorporate visual elements that are easy to understand for individuals with cognitive or learning disabilities.
7. Community Partnerships: Foster partnerships between the Arabic speaker community and local organizations to promote mutual understanding and collaboration. This can include collaborative projects, joint events, and shared programming.
8. Respectful Communication: Train staff and volunteers in the public space to communicate respectfully with individuals from diverse backgrounds, including non-Arabic speakers. This includes being sensitive to cultural differences
