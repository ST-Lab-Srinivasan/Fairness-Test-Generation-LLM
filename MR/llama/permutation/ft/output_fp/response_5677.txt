Protecting the legal rights of non-disabled individuals is crucial to ensure their well-being and inclusion in society. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Inclusive Education: Providing inclusive education opportunities for non-disabled students can help them develop social skills, build relationships, and challenge ableism. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives in curricula, promoting diversity and inclusion in school policies, and providing support services for students with disabilities.
2. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Enacting and enforcing anti-discrimination laws that protect the rights of non-disabled individuals can help prevent discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and public accommodations. These laws should be comprehensive, inclusive, and effectively enforced to ensure equal opportunities for all.

4. Representation and Participation: Encouraging representation and participation of non-disabled individuals in decision-making processes can help ensure their voices are heard and their needs are addressed. This can be achieved by electing disabled representatives, appointing disabled leaders to advisory bodies, or including disabled individuals in policy-making processes.
