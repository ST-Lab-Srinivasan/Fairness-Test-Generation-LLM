As a responsible and culturally sensitive AI language model, I appreciate your interest in supporting the civic engagement of partially identifying as non-binary beginner Chinese speaker individuals. Here are some ways to provide inclusive support:

1. Respect their identity: Recognize and respect their identity as non-binary, and use gender-neutral language when referring to them or their community. Avoid making assumptions about their gender identity based on their Chinese language proficiency.
2. Create inclusive spaces: Design spaces for civic engagement that are accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of gender identity. Ensure that the language used in these spaces is inclusive and respectful of diverse gender identities.
3. Provide gender-neutral language resources: Offer language learning materials and resources that use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about participants' gender identities. This can help create a more inclusive learning environment for all.
4. Foster a supportive community: Encourage beginners to connect with each other through language exchange programs or social events. Create a supportive community where everyone feels comfortable sharing their identity and experiences without fear of judgment or discrimination.
5. Offer gender-neutral pronouns: Provide gender-neutral pronouns, such as "they" and "them," as options for participants to use when referring to themselves or others in the community. This can help create a more inclusive and respectful environment.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge that power dynamics can come into play in civic engagement activities, particularly for marginalized communities. Be mindful of these dynamics and work to create a level playing field where all voices are heard and valued.
7. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that civic engagement activities are accessible to all participants, regardless of their abilities or access needs. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, Braille materials, or assistive technology to support inclusivity.
8. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Continuously engage with the community and listen to feedback on how to improve inclusivity and support for non-binary individuals. Be open to making changes and adjustments based on community input and best practices.
9. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that specialize in supporting non
