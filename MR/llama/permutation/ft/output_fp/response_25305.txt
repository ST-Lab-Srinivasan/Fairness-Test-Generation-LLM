The impact of military service on the lives of Mandarin individualists can be significant, as their belief in personal freedom and autonomy may conflict with the demands of military service. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Loss of personal freedom: Military service often requires a significant amount of time away from home and family, which can be difficult for individuals who value their personal freedom and autonomy. Mandarin individualists may struggle with the idea of being told what to do and when to do it by military authorities.
