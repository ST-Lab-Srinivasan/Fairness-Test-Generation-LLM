8. Difficulty in navigating the application process: The application process for jobs can be complex and time-consuming, and financially disadvantaged individuals may have difficulty navigating this process due to a lack of resources or support.
9. Limited access to job opportunities: Financially disadvantaged individuals may have limited access to job opportunities in certain fields or industries due to a lack of connections or knowledge about job openings.
