As a Buddhist community, it's important to recognize that the needs of recently single casual Buddhist individuals with PhDs may differ from those of other members. Here are some ways you can address their specific needs:

1. Flexibility: Recently single individuals with PhDs may have busy schedules and multiple commitments, such as research, teaching, and family responsibilities. Therefore, it's important to offer flexible scheduling options for meditation sessions, retreats, or other community events.
2. Intellectual stimulation: These individuals may be looking for a spiritual community that can provide intellectual stimulation and challenging teachings. Consider offering lectures, workshops, or discussions on various Buddhist topics, such as the nature of reality, the role of emotions in decision-making, or the intersection of Buddhism and science.
3. Support networks: PhD holders may be used to working independently and may struggle with the transition to a group setting. Create opportunities for them to connect with other members on a more personal level, such as small study groups or mentorship programs.
4. Access to resources: Provide access to resources such as books, articles, or online courses that can help them deepen their understanding of Buddhism and its practical applications.
5. Personalized guidance: Recently single individuals with PhDs may be seeking personalized guidance on how to integrate Buddhist teachings into their daily lives. Offer one-on-one mentorship programs or individual coaching sessions with experienced Buddhist practitioners.
6. Community building: Encourage members to connect with each other through social events, volunteer opportunities, or community service projects. This can help build a sense of belonging and support within the community.
7. Inclusive language: Be mindful of language use in your community, avoiding terminology that may be alienating or exclusionary to recently single individuals with PhDs. Use inclusive language and practices that welcome diverse perspectives and experiences.
8. Online presence: Many PhD holders may not have the time or flexibility to attend in-person events. Create an online presence for your community, such as a website, blog, or social media group, where members can connect, share resources, and participate in discussions remotely.
