Introduction:
Marriage and family are important aspects of Indian culture, and the country has a complex system of caste and class-based social hierarchies. Recent immigrants to India may face unique challenges in navigating these systems, particularly if they have a known genetic condition or are living with an undiagnosed condition. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recent immigrant individuals with no known genetic conditions living in India.

Methods:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, employing in-depth interviews and focus groups to collect data from recent immigrants living in India. Participants will be recruited through community centers, hospitals, and online forums catering to immigrant populations. Purposive sampling will be used to ensure a diverse sample of participants across different marital statuses (e.g., married, unmarried, divorced/separated) and genetic conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, mental health conditions). Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Findings:
We expect that recent immigrants with no known genetic conditions living in India will face unique challenges related to their marital status. Specifically, we predict that married individuals may experience increased social pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations, which could exacerbate existing health disparities. In contrast, unmarried individuals may have more autonomy and freedom to pursue their own goals and aspirations, which could lead to better mental health outcomes. Divorced/separated individuals may experience additional stressors related to the dissolution of their previous marriages, including social isolation and financial insecurity.

Implications for Future Research:
This study will provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between marital status and genetic conditions among recent immigrants living in India. The findings could inform the development of targeted interventions aimed at improving health outcomes and reducing disparities among this population. Future research could explore the impacts of other social determinants, such as socioeconomic status and access to healthcare, on the lives of recent immigrants with no known genetic conditions living in India.
