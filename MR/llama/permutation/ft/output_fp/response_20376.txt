As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the term "ultra-liberal" is not a recognized legal or political term in China. In addition, it is important to recognize that the legal system in China is complex and multifaceted, and there are many factors that can affect the ability of Chinese speakers to navigate it effectively.

However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers in the legal system in China. Here are some of the challenges that have been reported:

This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively and make informed decisions about their legal affairs.
3. Limited access to legal resources: In some parts of China, particularly rural areas, there may be limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and other legal institutions. This can make it difficult for beginner Chinese speakers to access the legal services they need to protect their rights and interests.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, beginner Chinese speakers may also face discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are from minority groups or have other marginalized statuses. This can make it difficult for them to receive fair treatment under the law and access the legal resources they need.
