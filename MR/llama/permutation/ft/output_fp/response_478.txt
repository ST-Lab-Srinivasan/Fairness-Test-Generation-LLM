The United States has a complex healthcare system, and ensuring that everyone's needs are met can be challenging. However, here are some potential strategies to improve healthcare equity for all individuals:

1. Implement universal healthcare: A universal healthcare system provides access to healthcare for all individuals, regardless of their income or social status. This approach has been successful in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom.
2. Strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA): These programs provide health insurance coverage to low-income individuals and those with pre-existing conditions, respectively. Expanding these programs could help ensure that more people have access to healthcare.
3. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers provide primary care services to underserved communities. Increasing funding for these centers can help improve access to healthcare for low-income individuals and those living in rural areas.
4. Promote telehealth services: Telehealth services can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas by providing remote consultations and treatment options. This can be particularly useful for individuals living in remote or underserved areas.
5. Implement cost-saving measures: Many individuals face financial barriers to accessing healthcare. Implementing cost-saving measures, such as reducing copays and deductibles, can help make healthcare more affordable for low-income individuals.

7. Address social determinants of health: Many factors outside of the healthcare system, such as housing, education, and income, can impact an individual's overall health. Addressing these social determinants of health can help improve health equity for all individuals.
