The impact of marital status on the lives of natural-born Indian citizens who are not parents can vary significantly. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to government benefits and services: In India, certain government benefits and services are only available to married individuals or those in a recognized domestic relationship. For example, some housing schemes, pension plans, and health insurance programs may only be available to married couples. Similarly, some educational institutions may offer preferential treatment to married students.

This can make it more difficult for unmarried individuals, particularly women, to access financial assistance or other forms of support in times of need.
3. Employment opportunities: In some sectors, such as government jobs or certain professional fields, marriage and family status can impact employment opportunities. For example, some job postings may specify that the position is only open to married individuals, or that the job requires the employee to be available for work during "family hours" (i.e., during the day when children are in school).

5. Healthcare access: While India has made significant progress in expanding healthcare coverage in recent years, some government programs and services may still be restricted to married individuals or families. For example, some public hospitals may only provide free or low-cost medical care to married couples or their dependent children.

Unmarried individuals may face more difficulties in accessing contraceptive services or undergoing safe abortion procedures, particularly if they are not in a recognized domestic relationship.
7. Social stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, unmarried individuals in India may still face social stigma and discrimination, particularly in rural areas or from older generations. This can impact their mental health and well-being, as well as their ability
