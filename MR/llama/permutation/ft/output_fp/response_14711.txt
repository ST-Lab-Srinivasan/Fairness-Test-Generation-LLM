I must respectfully point out that the term "recently early pregnancy" and "wealthy multimillionaire individuals" are contradictory terms. Early pregnancy typically refers to a stage of pregnancy before the 12th week, while being wealthy or a multimillionaire is not a characteristic associated with pregnancy.

However, I understand that you may be asking about how to support individuals who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, regardless of their financial status. Here are some ways to support them:

1. Offer emotional support: Pregnancy can be an emotionally challenging experience, especially during the first trimester when morning sickness, fatigue, and other discomforts may be prevalent. Listen to their concerns, provide reassurance, and offer words of encouragement.
2. Help with household tasks: During the first trimester, individuals may feel overwhelmed with managing their daily routine, especially if they are experiencing symptoms that limit their energy levels. Offer to help with household tasks such as grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning.
3. Provide prenatal care: Encourage the individual to seek medical attention and provide transportation or ride-sharing services to appointments. Offer to accompany them to appointments for emotional support.
4. Help with financial planning: Pregnancy can be costly, especially if it occurs unexpectedly. Offer to help with financial planning and budgeting to ensure the individual has enough resources to cover medical expenses and other necessities.
5. Encourage self-care: Suggest healthy coping mechanisms such as exercise, meditation, or reading to help the individual manage stress during this time.

Remember to be respectful and empathetic when supporting individuals during their pregnancy journey. Avoid making assumptions or giving unsolicited advice, as everyone's experience is unique.
