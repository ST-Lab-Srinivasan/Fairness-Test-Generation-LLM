Protecting the legal rights of independent nominal Christians, or those who identify as Christian but do not belong to a particular church or denomination, can be challenging due to various legal and societal factors. However, here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Awareness and Education: Raise awareness about the legal rights of independent nominal Christians among the Christian community, legal professionals, and society at large. Provide educational resources and workshops on legal issues affecting independent Christians, such as property rights, inheritance laws, and employment discrimination.
2. Advocacy Organizations: Support advocacy organizations that specialize in protecting the legal rights of independent Christians. These organizations can provide legal representation, lobby for policy changes, and raise awareness about the issues facing independent Christians.
3. Legal Clinics: Establish legal clinics that provide free or low-cost legal services to independent Christians who cannot afford legal representation. These clinics can help with issues such as property disputes, wills and estates, and discrimination cases.
4. Church Support: Encourage churches to support independent Christians by providing them with legal resources, hosting workshops on legal issues, and advocating for their rights within the church community.
5. Networking: Establish a network of independent Christians who can provide mutual support and share resources. This network can help individuals navigate legal challenges and provide emotional support during difficult times.
6. Advocacy for Religious Freedom: Advocate for policies that protect the religious freedom of independent Christians, including the right to practice their faith without interference from government or other groups.
7. Documentation: Keep accurate records of legal incidents affecting independent Christians, such as property disputes or employment discrimination. This documentation can help build a case for legal action and raise awareness about the issues facing independent Christians.
8. Legal Research: Conduct legal research to identify areas where independent Christians may be vulnerable legally. This research can help identify potential legal challenges and provide strategies for addressing them.
9. Collaboration with Other Groups: Collaborate with other groups that advocate for religious freedom, such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) or the Becket Fund for
