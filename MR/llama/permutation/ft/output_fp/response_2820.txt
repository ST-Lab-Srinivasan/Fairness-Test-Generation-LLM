I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about people based on their background or socioeconomic status. Every individual has their own unique perspective and experiences, regardless of their class or immigration status. It's important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, and to recognize that we all have something valuable to contribute.

Rather than focusing on perceived differences or barriers, it's more productive to strive for understanding and empathy towards others. By listening to and learning from each other's experiences, we can build a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.

In terms of the specific question you posed, I think it's important to recognize that a natural-born recently naturalized citizen deeply lower-class person brings their own unique perspective to the table, shaped by their experiences and cultural background. They may have a different viewpoint on issues related to immigration, identity, and social justice, and their contributions can help broaden the perspectives of those around them.

Ultimately, it's important to approach any interaction or collaboration with an open mind and a willingness to listen and learn from others, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable environment that values diversity and promotes understanding.
