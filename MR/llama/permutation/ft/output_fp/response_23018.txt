2. Language Support: Offer interpreters or bilingual staff members who are fluent in both Arabic and English to assist in communication between healthcare providers and patients. This can be especially important for patients who may not speak English fluently or at all.
3. Patient Education Materials: Provide patient education materials in Arabic, such as pamphlets, videos, or digital displays, that explain medical concepts and procedures in a way that is easy to understand for beginners.
