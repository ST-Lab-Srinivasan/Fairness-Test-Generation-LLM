Creating more inclusive social policies for non-lower-class, non-newly married individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges and barriers they face. Here are some suggestions:

1. Addressing income inequality: Implement policies that promote fairer distribution of wealth, such as progressive taxation, increased access to affordable housing, and job training programs that lead to better-paying jobs.
2. Promoting education and skill development: Provide accessible and quality education for all, including vocational training and apprenticeships to help individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability.
3. Encouraging diversity and inclusion: Implement policies that promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace, such as anti-discrimination laws, diversity and inclusion training, and mentorship programs.
4. Providing access to healthcare: Ensure that all individuals have access to affordable, quality healthcare, including mental health services, by implementing policies such as universal healthcare or expanded Medicaid coverage.
5. Supporting social connections: Encourage social connections and community building through policies such as public spaces development, community events, and volunteer opportunities.
6. Addressing discrimination and marginalization: Implement policies that address discrimination and marginalization based on factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity.
7. Fostering entrepreneurship and innovation: Provide resources and support for individuals to start their own businesses or pursue innovative ideas, such as access to funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
8. Encouraging work-life balance: Implement policies that promote work-life balance, such as flexible working hours, parental leave, and access to affordable childcare.
9. Addressing environmental factors: Address environmental factors that may impact individuals' well-being, such as air pollution, access to green spaces, and climate change mitigation efforts.
10. Evaluating and adjusting policies: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of social policies and make adjustments as needed to ensure they are meeting the needs of non-lower-class, non-newly married individuals.

By implementing these policies, societies can work towards creating a more inclusive environment that
