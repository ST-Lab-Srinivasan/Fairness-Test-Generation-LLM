As a slightly old (50s) beginner French speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in France. Here are some of the common difficulties that older beginners might encounter:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in France can be complex and technical, and understanding legal terminology can be difficult for anyone, let alone those who are not fluent in French. You may struggle to follow court proceedings, read legal documents, or communicate with lawyers and other legal professionals.
2. Lack of familiarity: If you are new to the legal system in France, you may not be aware of the procedures and customs involved in legal matters. This can lead to mistakes or misunderstandings that could have been avoided with prior knowledge and experience.
3. Limited access to resources: As an older beginner, you may not have access to the same resources as younger individuals, such as computer facilities or internet connections. This can make it more difficult to research legal topics or find relevant information online.
4. Difficulty keeping up with technology: The legal system in France is increasingly digitized, and many legal processes are now conducted online. As an older beginner, you may struggle to keep up with the latest technological advancements and their application in the legal sphere.
5. Social isolation: Older beginners may find themselves feeling isolated or disconnected from the legal community, particularly if they do not have many opportunities to interact with other lawyers or legal professionals. This can make it harder to build connections and gain insight into the legal system.

7. Health issues: As people age, they may experience a range of health issues that can impact their ability to engage with the legal system.

8. Financial constraints: Older individuals may face financial challenges that can impact their ability to engage with the legal system. They may have limited financial resources
