Creating more inclusive community events for native Chinese speakers who are not wealthy multimillionaires requires careful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and inclusive:

1. Offer free or low-cost admission: Many native Chinese speakers may not have the financial means to attend expensive events. By offering free or low-cost admission, you can make your event more accessible to a wider audience.
2. Provide interpretation services: Offering interpretation services in multiple languages, including Mandarin and Cantonese, can help ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy the event.
3. Use inclusive marketing materials: Make sure your marketing materials are available in multiple languages and are visually appealing to a diverse audience. Avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or exclusionary.
4. Involve diverse speakers and performers: Choose speakers and performers who reflect the diversity of your community, including native Chinese speakers from different backgrounds and identities.
5. Provide childcare and family-friendly activities: Offering childcare and family-friendly activities can help ensure that everyone can attend and enjoy the event, regardless of their age or ability to care for young children.
6. Create a safe and inclusive space: Make sure your event is a safe and inclusive space for everyone. Provide clear guidelines and expectations for behavior and address any incidents or issues promptly and respectfully.
7. Engage with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve diverse communities, such as community centers, schools, and cultural groups. This can help you reach a wider audience and create more inclusive events.
8. Offer translation and interpretation services: Provide translation and interpretation services for important announcements and activities to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the information being shared.
9. Use accessible language: Use language that is clear, concise, and accessible to a wide audience. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to some attendees.
10. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be respectful of the cultural practices and beliefs of native Chinese speakers, including their dietary restrictions and other cultural preferences.
