Creating more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-multimillionaire, and non-divorced multiple times individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges faced by these groups. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Address income inequality: Implement policies that promote fair and progressive taxation, such as increasing the tax rate on the wealthy and large corporations. This can help reduce the wealth gap and ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities like healthcare, education, and housing.
2. Strengthen social safety nets: Ensure that social welfare programs are adequately funded and accessible to those who need them, including unemployment benefits, food assistance, and housing support. This can help individuals and families who are struggling financially to get back on their feet.
3. Improve access to affordable healthcare: Enact policies that expand access to affordable healthcare, such as implementing a universal healthcare system or increasing funding for community clinics and hospitals. This can help ensure that everyone has access to quality medical care, regardless of their income level.
4. Invest in education and job training: Provide resources for vocational training and education programs that focus on in-demand skills, such as technology, healthcare, and sustainability. This can help individuals acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market and advance their careers.
5. Address discrimination and bias: Implement policies that address systemic racism and discrimination, such as anti-discrimination laws, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and cultural competency training for professionals. This can help create a more equitable society where everyone has equal opportunities to succeed.
6. Support marginalized communities: Provide targeted support to marginalized communities, such as low-income families, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals. This can include programs that address specific challenges faced by these groups, such as affordable housing, mental health services, and community development initiatives.
7. Foster community engagement and social connection: Encourage community engagement and social connection through programs that promote volunteerism, intergenerational relationships, and cultural exchange. This can help build stronger, more supportive communities where everyone feels valued
