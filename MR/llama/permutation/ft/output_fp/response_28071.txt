Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, native recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to create inclusive environments and accessible communication channels. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide interpretations or translations of important documents, meetings, and discussions to ensure that beginner Arabic speakers can participate fully. Offer language support services, such as interpreters or translation software, to facilitate communication.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Train decision-makers and stakeholders on cultural competency and sensitivity towards the experiences and perspectives of immigrant communities, including Arabic speakers. This will help build empathy and understanding, enabling more inclusive decision-making processes.
3. Community Outreach and Engagement: Engage with beginner Arabic speaker communities through community events, workshops, and town halls. Provide opportunities for them to share their experiences, concerns, and ideas directly with decision-makers. This will help build trust and ensure that their voices are heard in the decision-making process.
4. Advocacy and Leadership Development: Support local advocacy groups and leadership development programs specifically targeting beginner Arabic speakers. These initiatives can help amplify their voices and increase their representation in decision-making processes.
5. Technology-facilitated Participation: Utilize technology, such as online forums or mobile apps, to enable beginner Arabic speakers to participate in decision-making processes remotely. This can be particularly useful for those who face barriers to in-person participation due to language proficiency or other factors.
6. Collaborative Decision-Making: Foster collaborative decision-making processes that involve beginner Arabic speakers in the early stages of planning and problem-solving. Encourage active participation and engagement through brainstorming sessions, focus groups, or co-design workshops.
7. Accountability Mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms to ensure that decision-makers prioritize and act on the feedback and concerns of beginner Arabic speakers. This can be achieved by setting specific goals, establishing tracking systems, and regularly monitoring progress towards inclusivity targets.
