Ensuring that the educational needs of non-liberal students, including those with disabilities or other special needs, are met requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility features: Ensure that the learning environment is accessible to all students, regardless of their abilities. This includes physical accessibility (e.g., ramps, elevators, Braille signage), as well as digital accessibility (e.g., text-to-speech functionality, alt-text for images).
