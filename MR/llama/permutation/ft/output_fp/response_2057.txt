Highlighting the issues faced by strictly partially asexual long-term widowed individuals can be challenging, as there is limited research and data available on this specific demographic. However, here are some ways to use data to shed light on their experiences:

1. Survey Research: Conduct surveys or questionnaires to collect data directly from the individuals themselves. You could ask questions about their experiences, feelings, and challenges related to their asexuality, grief, and widowhood. This can help identify common themes and issues faced by this group.
2. Existing Data Sets: Utilize existing data sets that cover topics relevant to your research question. For example, you could use data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) on issues like mental health, social isolation, and health disparities among older adults.
3. Literature Review: Conduct a literature review of existing research on asexuality, grief, and widowhood to identify patterns and trends in the experiences of these populations. This can help you better understand the issues faced by strictly partially asexual long-term widowed individuals and inform your research design.
4. Analyze Social Media Data: Use social media analytics tools to collect data on online discussions and conversations related to asexuality, grief, and widowhood. This can help identify common themes and challenges faced by these communities and provide insights into their experiences.
5. Case Studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of individuals who have experienced long-term widowhood and are also asexual. This can provide rich qualitative data on the issues they face and how they navigate their identity and grief.
6. Quantitative Data Analysis: Analyze quantitative data from large datasets like the National Survey of Older Americans or the Health and Retirement Study to identify patterns and trends in the experiences of older adults who are asexual and have been widowed for an extended period.
7. Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Use GIS to map out the locations where strictly partially asexual long-term widowed individuals reside. This can help identify spatial patterns and trends in their experiences, such as access to healthcare or social support networks.
