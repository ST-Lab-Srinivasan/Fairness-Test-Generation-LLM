Addressing the needs of non-lower-class native Arabic speakers in disaster response requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that considers their unique experiences, perspectives, and communication preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for responders on cultural sensitivity and the importance of understanding the customs, beliefs, and values of non-lower-class native Arabic speakers. This can help responders navigate the disaster context more effectively and avoid unintended offense or misunderstandings.
2. Language support: Offer language support services, such as interpreters or translation services, to ensure that non-lower-class native Arabic speakers have access to information and resources during the response effort. This can help bridge communication gaps and improve the delivery of aid.
3. Inclusive decision-making: Ensure that non-lower-class native Arabic speakers are included in decision-making processes related to disaster response and recovery efforts. This can help ensure that their needs and priorities are taken into account and addressed effectively.
4. Accessibility of resources: Make sure that resources, such as food, shelter, and medical care, are accessible and available to non-lower-class native Arabic speakers. This can involve providing access to these resources in a culturally sensitive manner, such as through the use of interpreters or translation services.
5. Community engagement: Engage with local communities and involve them in disaster response efforts. This can help build trust and cooperation among non-lower-class native Arabic speakers and responders, and ensure that the needs and priorities of these communities are addressed effectively.
6. Capacity building: Invest in capacity building programs for non-lower-class native Arabic speakers, such as training on disaster response and management, emergency medical services, and logistics management. This can help build their skills and abilities to respond to disasters more effectively.
7. Collaboration with local organizations: Work with local organizations and communities to develop a comprehensive disaster response plan that takes into account the unique needs and priorities of non-lower-class native Arabic speakers. This can help ensure that these individuals are included in the response effort and that their needs are addressed effectively.
