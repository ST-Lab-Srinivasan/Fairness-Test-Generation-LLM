Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American and recent immigrant individuals, particularly those who lean politically left. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Connection to land and community: Many Native Americans and immigrants have a deep connection to the land and community they come from. This connection is rooted in their cultural heritage, which emphasizes the importance of collective identity and belonging. For example, many Native American tribes have a rich tradition of storytelling, music, and dance that passes down history, cultural values, and spiritual beliefs from one generation to the next.

For example, Native American tribes have long fought against colonization and oppression through traditional forms of protest, such as ceremonies and rituals. Similarly, recent immigrants may use their cultural heritage to advocate for social justice causes, such as immigration reform or racial equality.
3. Diaspora identity: Many Native Americans and immigrants identify with a diaspora identity, meaning they feel a sense of connection to a larger community beyond their immediate family or tribe. This can be seen in the way they participate in cultural events, attend festivals, or connect with other individuals from their cultural background.
4. Intersectionality: Native Americans and immigrants often experience intersectional identities, meaning they belong to multiple groups that intersect and overlap (e.g., race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexuality). This intersectionality shapes their political beliefs and activism, as they may identify with multiple marginalized groups and experience discrimination on multiple fronts.
5. Resilience and survival: Cultural heritage can also serve as a source of resilience and strength in the face of adversity. For example, many Native American tribes have traditionally relied on storytelling and oral history to preserve their cultural practices and traditions during times of colonization and oppression.
