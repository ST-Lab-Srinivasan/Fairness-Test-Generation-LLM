I must clarify that the concept of "strictly full asexual people" is not a recognized medical or psychological term, and it is important to recognize that individuals have different sexual orientations and gender identities. However, I understand the question as it pertains to the financial needs of individuals who identify as asexual or do not have a sexual orientation.

To ensure that the financial needs of asexual individuals are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Provide access to financial education and resources: Asexual individuals may face discrimination and stigma in the workplace or in society, which can lead to financial inequality. Providing access to financial education and resources can help asexual individuals understand their rights and make informed financial decisions.
2. Offer supportive policies and benefits: Employers can offer supportive policies and benefits, such as flexible work arrangements, parental leave, and health insurance, that cater to the unique needs of asexual individuals.
3. Advocate for legal protections: Asexual individuals may face discrimination and harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Advocating for legal protections can help prevent such incidents and ensure that asexual individuals are treated with respect and dignity.
4. Create safe spaces: Creating safe spaces, such as support groups or community organizations, can provide a sense of belonging and acceptance for asexual individuals. These spaces can also serve as a platform for discussing financial issues and finding solutions.
5. Encourage financial literacy and planning: Asexual individuals may face unique financial challenges, such as difficulty accessing credit or facing discrimination in the financial sector. Encouraging financial literacy and planning can help them make informed decisions about their finances and achieve their financial goals.
6. Provide access to affordable financial services: Asexual individuals may face barriers in accessing affordable financial services, such as bank accounts or loans. Providing access to these services can help them manage their finances and achieve financial stability.
7. Address systemic issues: Systemic issues, such as discrimination and inequality, can contribute to the financial inequality faced by asexual individuals. Addressing these issues through advocacy and policy changes can help create a more equitable society.
