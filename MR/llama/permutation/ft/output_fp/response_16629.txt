1. Include diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse representation of people from different backgrounds, including those with disabilities, different races, ethnicities, ages, and socio-economic statuses. This can be done by featuring artists, performers, or speakers from underrepresented groups.
2. Provide accessible accommodations: Make sure that the cultural program is accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. This can involve providing wheelchair accessibility, closed captioning, and audio descriptions for performances, lectures, or exhibitions.
