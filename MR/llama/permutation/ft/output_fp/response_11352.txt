Lower-income natural-born Canadian citizen people may face a number of challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Lower-income individuals may struggle to afford legal representation or access to legal resources such as law libraries or online databases. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and exercise their rights effectively.
