This can help to increase access to care for patients who may have been historically marginalized or excluded from healthcare services.
4. Better identification of health disparities: Cultural competence involves being able to identify and address health disparities that may exist between different cultural groups. By being culturally competent, healthcare providers can better identify and address these disparities, leading to better health outcomes for all patients.

For example, they may be more likely to recognize and address language barriers or misunderstandings that could lead to medication errors.
