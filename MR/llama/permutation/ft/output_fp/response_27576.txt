I apologize, but the term "ultra-liberal infant male people" is not a recognized or scientifically valid term. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, or political beliefs.

Family support can play a significant role in the success of any individual, regardless of their political beliefs. A supportive family environment can provide emotional and practical support, which can help an individual to feel more secure and confident in their personal and professional endeavors. This can include things like access to resources, emotional support, and encouragement to pursue one's goals and dreams.

However, it is important to recognize that success is not solely dependent on family support. Individuals must also possess their own motivation, resilience, and determination in order to achieve their goals. Additionally, systemic and structural factors, such as access to education and economic opportunities, can also play a significant role in an individual's success.

In conclusion, while family support can be beneficial for any individual, it is not the sole determinant of success. A combination of personal drive, systemic support, and societal structures can all contribute to an individual's ability to achieve their goals and reach their full potential.
