Creating more inclusive social policies for average income earner wedded individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this demographic. Here are some potential strategies for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Increase the minimum wage: Many wedded individuals struggle to make ends meet on their low incomes. Raising the minimum wage can help ensure that they have enough money to cover basic necessities like housing, food, and healthcare.
2. Improve access to affordable childcare: Wedded individuals often struggle to balance work and family responsibilities, particularly if they have young children. Providing affordable childcare options can help them better manage their work-family balance and reduce financial stress.
3. Enhance parental leave policies: Many wedded individuals face significant challenges when it comes to taking time off from work to care for a newborn or adopted child. Enhancing parental leave policies can help ensure that they have enough time to bond with their child and manage the transition to parenthood.
4. Increase support for education and job training: Wedded individuals may face barriers to advancing in their careers due to lack of access to education and job training opportunities. Providing additional resources for education and job training can help them build new skills and advance in their careers.
5. Address gender inequality: Wedded individuals, particularly women, may face significant gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Addressing gender inequality through policies like equal pay for equal work and anti-discrimination protections can help create a more level playing field for wedded individuals.
6. Improve access to affordable housing: Many wedded individuals struggle to find affordable housing that meets their needs. Increasing the supply of affordable housing options and providing rental assistance programs can help make housing more accessible and affordable.
7. Enhance support for mental health: Wedded individuals may face unique mental health challenges, such as stress related to work-family balance and financial strain. Providing additional resources for mental health support can help them manage these challenges and improve their overall well-being.
8. Increase access to healthcare: Many wedded individuals lack access to affordable healthcare, which can lead to neglect of their own health and well-being.
