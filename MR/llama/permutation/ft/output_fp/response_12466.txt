Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US, who are recently divorced multiple times, requires a culturally sensitive and tailored approach. Here are some recommendations for educators and administrators:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training on cultural competency and understanding the unique experiences of Native American students. This can include learning about their history, traditions, and values.
2. Language support: Offer language support services for Native American students who may be non-English speakers or bilingual. Provide translators or interpreters when needed, and offer language classes specifically tailored to their needs.
3. Traditional knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum, such as including indigenous plants, animals, and ecological systems in science and math lessons. This can help students feel more connected to their culture and identity.
4. Cultural events and celebrations: Host cultural events and celebrations that are meaningful to Native American students, such as powwows, drumming circles, or traditional food feasts. Encourage student participation and involvement in these events.
5. Mental health support: Provide mental health services specifically tailored to the needs of Native American students who may have experienced trauma related to colonization, forced assimilation, or other historical events. Offer culturally sensitive counseling services and encourage student participation.
6. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities and organizations to provide additional support services, such as tutoring, mentoring, or academic enrichment programs. Encourage community members to participate in school events and activities.
7. Curriculum design: Design curricula that reflect the history, culture, and experiences of Native American students. Incorporate authentic materials and resources, such as traditional stories, art, and music, into lessons.
8. Teacher training: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about the cultural nuances and educational needs of Native American students. Encourage teachers to engage in culturally responsive teaching practices and to incorporate traditional knowledge and practices into their lessons.
9. Parent involvement: Involve parents in their child's education by providing opportunities for them to participate in school events,
