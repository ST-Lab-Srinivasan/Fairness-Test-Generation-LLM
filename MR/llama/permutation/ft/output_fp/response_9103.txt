There are several ways in which data can be used to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers:

1. Language proficiency assessments: Conducting language proficiency assessments using standardized tests such as TOEFL, IELTS, or CEFR can provide valuable insights into the level of proficiency of beginner English speakers. These assessments can help identify areas where individuals need improvement, such as grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing skills.
2. User surveys: Conducting surveys among beginner English learners can provide information on their experiences, challenges, and motivation levels. Surveys can be administered online or in-person and can cover topics such as language learning goals, barriers to learning, and sources of support.
3. Corpus analysis: Analyzing large databases of texts, such as the Cambridge International Corpus of English or the British National Corpus, can provide insights into the language used by beginner English speakers. This can help identify common mistakes, language patterns, and areas where individuals may need more practice.
4. Learner corpora: Creating learner corpora, which are databases of texts written by learners of a particular language, can provide valuable insights into the language used by beginner English speakers. These corpora can be analyzed to identify common errors, language patterns, and areas where individuals may need more practice.
5. Language learning logs: Analyzing the language learning logs of beginner English speakers can provide information on how they spend their time learning English, what activities they find most helpful, and what challenges they face. This data can help identify areas where individuals may need more support or resources.
6. Social media analytics: Analyzing social media posts related to language learning can provide insights into the challenges and motivation levels of beginner English speakers. This data can be analyzed to identify common themes, such as the most popular language learning strategies, the most frequent mistakes, and the most effective ways to stay motivated.
7. Language learning apps: Analyzing data from language learning apps, such as Duolingo or Babbel, can provide information on how beginner English speakers use these tools and what challenges they face while learning English. This data can help identify areas where these apps may need to improve or add new features.
