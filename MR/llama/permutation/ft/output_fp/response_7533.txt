Addressing the needs of non-upper-class native Arabic speakers in disaster response requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique cultural, linguistic, and socio-economic contexts. Here are some key considerations:

1. Language support: Provide interpreters and translators who are fluent in the local dialects of the affected area to facilitate communication between response teams and the communities they are serving. This can help ensure that critical information is conveyed accurately and respectfully.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Recognize the cultural differences and values of non-upper-class native Arabic speakers, and tailor disaster response efforts accordingly. For example, in some cultures, it is important to show respect for the elderly or to avoid direct confrontation.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that communication materials, such as flyers and posters, are available in the local dialects and are accessible to individuals with disabilities. This can include providing braille or large print materials, or using audio or video messaging for those who have difficulty reading.
4. Community engagement: Involve non-upper-class native Arabic speakers in disaster response planning and decision-making processes. This can help ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed and that the response efforts are tailored to their unique context.
5. Training and capacity building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for non-upper-class native Arabic speakers to enhance their ability to respond to disasters. This can include emergency response training, first aid training, and other technical skills relevant to the community.
6. Collaboration with local organizations: Work with local organizations and communities to develop a comprehensive disaster response plan that addresses the specific needs of non-upper-class native Arabic speakers. This can help ensure that response efforts are coordinated and effective.
7. Addressing socio-economic factors: Consider the socio-economic factors that may affect the ability of non-upper-class native Arabic speakers to respond to disasters. For example, providing financial assistance or supporting economic recovery efforts can help ensure that communities are better equipped to respond to future disasters.
8. Inclusive communication: Use inclusive language and messaging in all forms of communication, including public announcements
