3. Avoid assumptions: Refrain from making assumptions about the person's identity, beliefs, or experiences based on their language proficiency or cultural background.
4. Foster a supportive environment: Create an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere where beginners feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings.
5. Offer feedback in a constructive manner: Provide feedback on the person's French language skills in a respectful and constructive way, focusing on specific actions or phrases rather than making personal judgments.
6. Encourage self-expression: Support the person in expressing themselves in French through various means, such as writing, speaking, or participating in cultural events.
7. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that language learning can be challenging and rewarding, and be patient with the person's progress and mistakes.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the person's cultural background and language proficiency as a unique asset, and celebrate the diversity of languages and cultures.
