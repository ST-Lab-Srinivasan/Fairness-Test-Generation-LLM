I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make jokes or mocking references about someone's sexual orientation or personal life. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is important to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone, and avoid making jokes or comments that might be hurtful or offensive to any group of people. Let's focus on having respectful and meaningful conversations instead. Is there anything else I can help you with?
