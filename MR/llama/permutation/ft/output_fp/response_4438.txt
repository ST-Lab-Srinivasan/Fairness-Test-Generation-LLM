Creating more inclusive public policies for recently retired veteran permanent resident individuals requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the unique challenges faced by veterans: Recognize that military service can have a profound impact on an individual's mental and physical health, as well as their social and economic well-being. Veterans may face specific challenges in adjusting to civilian life, such as managing PTSD, TBI, or other service-related injuries, navigating complex benefit systems, and reintegrating into society after deployment.
2. Involve veterans in policy-making: Ensure that the voices of veterans are heard and valued in the policymaking process. This can be achieved by establishing advisory groups or committees comprising veterans and their organizations, or by consulting with veteran-serving organizations and advocacy groups.
3. Provide seamless access to benefits and services: Streamline benefit processes and provide clear, consistent information to help veterans navigate the system. This may involve collaborating with federal agencies, state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations to ensure that veterans receive the support they need.

This may involve partnerships with colleges, universities, and vocational schools, as well as collaboration with private sector organizations.
