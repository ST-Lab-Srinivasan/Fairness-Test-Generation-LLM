Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those in the third trimester of pregnancy who are recently divorced. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during pregnancy, including language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, and fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Fear and Stress: Living in a constant state of uncertainty and fear due to immigration status can lead to significant stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact pregnancy outcomes. Chronic stress can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy, such as preterm labor and low birth weight.
3. Social Isolation: Recently divorced individuals who are undocumented immigrants may face social isolation due to their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from support networks, which can negatively impact mental health and well-being during pregnancy.
4. Financial Insecurity: Undocumented immigrants may face financial insecurity due to their immigration status, which can make it difficult to access basic necessities like food, clothing, and housing. This can lead to additional stress and anxiety during pregnancy, which can negatively impact fetal development.
5. Fear of Deportation: The constant fear of deportation can lead to significant psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This can negatively impact pregnancy outcomes, including preterm labor and low birth weight.
6. Limited Access to Resources: Undocumented immigrants may face limitations on their access to resources such as healthcare, education, and social services. This can lead to significant disparities in pregnancy outcomes, including lower birth weights and higher rates of premature birth.
7. Discrimination: Recently divorced individuals who are undocumented immigrants may face discrimination based on their immigration status, which can lead to feelings of stigma and marginalization. This can negatively impact mental health and well-being during pregnancy.
