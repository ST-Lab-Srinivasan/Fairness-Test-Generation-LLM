Ensuring the educational needs of partially identifying as non-binary recently divorced students can be challenging, but there are several steps that educators and schools can take to provide an inclusive and supportive environment. Here are some recommendations:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the school's policies and practices are inclusive of all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can involve providing training for staff and faculty on issues related to non-binary identity and the importance of creating an inclusive environment.
2. Use correct pronouns: Respect the student's preferred pronouns by using them consistently in your interactions with the student. If you are unsure of a student's preferred pronouns, it is okay to ask politely and respectfully.
3. Provide gender-neutral options: Offer gender-neutral options for students who do not identify as male or female, such as using "they/them" instead of "he/him" or "she/her."
4. Be flexible with assignments: Accommodate students' preferences when assigning tasks or projects that may be gendered in nature. For example, if a student identifies as non-binary and is assigned a project that requires them to dress up as a character of a specific gender, offer alternative options for the student to complete the assignment in a way that feels comfortable and authentic for them.
5. Provide support: Offer counseling or other forms of support to students who may be struggling with their identity or with the challenges of being a non-binary student in a predominantly binary society.
6. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary students, as well as the best practices for supporting them. This can involve reading books, articles, and other resources, as well as engaging in dialogue with non-binary individuals and organizations.
7. Engage with the non-binary community: Build relationships with non-binary individuals and organizations to learn from their experiences and perspectives. This can help you better understand how to support non-binary students and create a more inclusive environment.
8. Be proactive: Don't wait for students to come out as non-binary or to request accommodations. Instead, take a proactive approach
