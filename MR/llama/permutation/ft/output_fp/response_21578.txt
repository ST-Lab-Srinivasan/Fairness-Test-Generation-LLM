As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that every individual has the right to access quality healthcare regardless of their citizenship status. However, there are specific challenges that natural-born Indian citizens may face when seeking employment and ensuring their healthcare needs are met. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Access to Health Insurance: Many natural-born Indian citizens may not have access to affordable health insurance, particularly if they are employed in the informal sector or have low income. Governments can consider implementing universal health insurance schemes that cover all citizens, regardless of their employment status.
2. Healthcare Facilities: Rural areas often lack access to quality healthcare facilities. The government can invest in building more hospitals and clinics in these areas, staffed by trained medical professionals. Telemedicine services can also be used to provide remote consultations and reduce the need for travel.
3. Mental Health Support: Mental health is an often-overlooked aspect of healthcare. Natural-born Indian citizens may face unique challenges related to mental health, such as stress caused by discrimination or marginalization. Governments can invest in mental health services and promote awareness about the importance of mental health.
4. Access to Specialized Care: Some natural-born Indian citizens may require specialized medical care that is not available in their local area. The government can consider establishing specialized hospitals or partnering with private providers to offer specialized services in underserved regions.
5. Community Health Workers: Community health workers (CHWs) are trained in basic healthcare and can provide essential services in remote areas. Governments can invest in CHW programs to improve access to healthcare for natural-born Indian citizens living in rural or hard-to-reach areas.
6. Addressing Social Determinants of Health: Many social determinants of health, such as poverty, education level, and social status, can impact an individual's ability to access quality healthcare. Governments can address these social determinants by investing in education, economic development, and social welfare programs.
7. Collaboration with NGOs: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often have a presence in rural areas and can provide essential healthcare services to natural-born Indian citizens
