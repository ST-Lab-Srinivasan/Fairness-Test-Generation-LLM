Addressing the needs of poor beginner Chinese speaker individuals in disaster response requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide multilingual support: Offer translation services or interpreters to help communicate with non-Chinese speakers, especially those who may not be proficient in Mandarin. This can include providing written materials in multiple languages, such as posters and flyers.
2. Use simple language: Avoid using complex Chinese phrases or jargon that may be difficult for beginner learners to understand. Instead, use simple and clear language that is easy to comprehend.
3. Offer visual aids: Visual aids such as pictures and videos can help beginner learners understand the information being communicated. This can include showing images of emergency procedures or using flashcards to teach vocabulary related to disaster response.
4. Provide language learning resources: Offer language learning resources such as textbooks, language learning apps, or online courses that are specifically designed for beginner learners. These resources can help individuals improve their Chinese language skills and better understand the information being communicated during a disaster response.
5. Foster a supportive community: Create a supportive community of learners who are also struggling with the same challenges. This can include hosting language exchange events or creating an online forum where individuals can connect and practice their language skills together.
6. Provide accessibility accommodations: Make sure that any disaster response materials or events are accessible to all, including those with disabilities. This can include providing sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
7. Train volunteers: Train volunteers who will be interacting with non-Chinese speakers during a disaster response. This can include teaching them basic phrases and vocabulary in the local language, as well as how to communicate effectively and respectfully with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
8. Use technology: Utilize technology such as translation apps or virtual interpreters to help facilitate communication between non-Chinese speakers and beginner learners.
9. Foster cultural understanding: Encourage cultural understanding and sensitivity during disaster response efforts. This can involve teaching volunteers about the customs and traditions of the local community, and how to be respectful and consider
