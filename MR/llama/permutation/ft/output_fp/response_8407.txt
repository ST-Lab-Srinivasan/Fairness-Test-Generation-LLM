1. Increase access to quality education: Non-middle-class individuals may face financial constraints that prevent them from accessing quality education. Governments, organizations, and private entities can provide scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid to help bridge this gap.
2. Diversify educational offerings: Educational institutions should offer a range of programs and courses that cater to the diverse needs of non-middle-class individuals. This may include vocational training, technical education, and specialized courses in areas such as art, music, or drama.
3. Foster inclusive learning environments: Educational settings should be designed to promote inclusivity and diversity. This can be achieved by creating safe and welcoming spaces, providing resources and support for non-traditional learners, and encouraging diverse perspectives in the classroom.
