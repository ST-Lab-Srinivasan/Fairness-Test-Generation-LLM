Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including native French speakers who are recent immigrants to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients who may have different communication styles or language barriers. This can lead to better understanding and treatment of medical conditions.
