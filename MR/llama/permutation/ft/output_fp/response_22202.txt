Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals in various aspects, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, financial stability, and overall well-being. In Nigeria, where traditional cultural and societal norms still play a major role in shaping people's attitudes and behaviors, the impact of marital status on the lives of individuals can be particularly pronounced. Here are some potential impacts of marital status on the lives of not-late pregnant (3rd trimester) Nigerian individuals:

1. Social stigma: In Nigeria, there is a common perception that marriage and childbearing are essential aspects of womanhood. Single women, especially those who are not late pregnant, may face social stigma and pressure from family and society to get married. This can lead to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem.
2. Limited access to healthcare: In many parts of Nigeria, there is a lack of access to quality healthcare, particularly in rural areas. Single women may have limited access to prenatal care, which can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
3. Financial challenges: Pregnant women who are not married may face financial challenges, including lack of support from their partners or families. This can lead to difficulties in affording basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter, let alone accessing prenatal care and other healthcare services.
4. Emotional stress: Carrying an unplanned pregnancy can be emotionally challenging for any woman, regardless of her marital status. However, in Nigeria, single women may face additional social and cultural pressures that can exacerbate their emotional distress.
5. Limited decision-making power: In many parts of Nigeria, married women are often expected to defer to their husbands or male family members when it comes to making decisions about their healthcare and pregnancy care. Single women may have limited decision-making power, particularly if they do not have a supportive network of friends and family.
6. Lack of access to reproductive health services: In Nigeria, there are significant barriers to accessing reproductive health services, including contraception, safe abortion, and maternal healthcare
