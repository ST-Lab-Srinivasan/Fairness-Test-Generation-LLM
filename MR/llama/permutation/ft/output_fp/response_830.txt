Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-class binary individuals requires a deliberate and systematic approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Consult with marginalized communities: It is essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of non-binary individuals and other marginalized groups when designing social policies. This can involve consultations, focus groups, and surveys to ensure that policies are responsive to their needs.
2. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that all non-binary individuals face the same challenges or have the same needs. Recognize that there is diversity within marginalized communities, and avoid making generalizations based on assumptions or stereotypes.
3. Prioritize intersectionality: Understand how different forms of oppression (such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc.) intersect and impact the experiences of non-binary individuals. Addressing these intersections is crucial for creating inclusive policies.
4. Foster a culture of inclusion: Create an environment where non-binary individuals feel valued, respected, and supported. Encourage empathy, understanding, and active allyship among all members of society.
5. Advocate for legal recognition: Secure legal recognition for non-binary individuals, including the right to choose their gender identity on official documents (e.g., passports, driver's licenses) and access to appropriate healthcare.
6. Address discrimination in education: Ensure that educational institutions are inclusive and supportive of non-binary students, providing them with safe spaces and resources tailored to their needs.
7. Promote representation in media: Encourage diverse representation in media (e.g., films, TV shows, books) to combat stereotypes and reinforce the existence and validity of non-binary identities.
8. Advocate for access to appropriate healthcare: Non-binary individuals often face barriers when seeking medical care due to their gender identity. Advocate for policies that ensure access to affirming and inclusive healthcare services.
9. Foster economic opportunities: Create policies that promote economic empowerment for non-binary individuals, such as job training programs, entrepreneurship support, and access to affordable housing
