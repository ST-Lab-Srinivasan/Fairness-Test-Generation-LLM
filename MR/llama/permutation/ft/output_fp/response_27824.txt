I must clarify that the term "mentally disabled" is not a suitable or respectful term to use when referring to individuals with mental health conditions. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or challenges.

This helps to promote a more inclusive and supportive environment for everyone.
