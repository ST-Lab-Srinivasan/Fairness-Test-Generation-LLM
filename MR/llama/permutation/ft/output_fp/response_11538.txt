Creating more inclusive community events for very old (90s+) non-citizens requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this age group:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event venue is wheelchair-accessible and has amenities such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for events that include presentations or performances.
2. Transportation: Offer transportation options for non-drivers, such as public transportation or door-to-door pickup services. This will help reduce transportation barriers and ensure that everyone can attend the event.
3. Language support: Provide interpreters or translation services in the language spoken by the majority of the older non-citizens in the community. This will enable them to fully participate in the event and avoid feeling isolated.
4. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing background noise, using bright lighting, and providing comfortable seating. This will help older adults with hearing or vision impairments to fully engage in the event.
5. Simple menus: Offer simple, familiar food options for older adults who may have difficulty with complex menu items. Consider providing vegetarian or halal options to cater to diverse dietary needs.
6. Social support: Encourage social interaction by providing opportunities for older adults to connect with each other. This can be done through group activities, table assignments, or simply by creating a relaxed atmosphere.
7. Technology support: Provide technology support for older adults who may need assistance using digital devices. Offer training sessions or guides on how to use event-related apps or websites.
8. Timing: Choose a timing that works best for the majority of older adults in the community, taking into account their sleep schedules and daily routines. Avoid scheduling events during peak activity hours or when they may be most likely to interfere with their regular routine.
9. Promotion: Utilize multiple channels to promote the event, including print media, social media, and community flyers. Ensure that promotion materials are easily accessible and understandable for older adults who may have difficulty accessing digital content.
