Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Chinese speakers who are not deep in poverty can be achieved through a variety of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer free or low-cost events: Many beginners may not have the financial means to attend expensive cultural events. By offering free or low-cost events, you can make them more accessible to a wider range of people.
2. Provide childcare and translation services: For families with young children, finding childcare can be a significant barrier to attending cultural events. Consider providing childcare services during your events to make them more family-friendly. Additionally, offering translation services can help beginners who may not speak Chinese fluently to participate in the event.
3. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that your events are welcoming and inclusive to all participants, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background. This can involve providing clear instructions in multiple languages, using visual aids and multimedia presentations, and having a diverse group of volunteers and staff.
4. Offer interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities into your events that allow beginners to participate and engage with the culture in a fun and engaging way. This could include language games, cultural crafts, or dance classes.
5. Partner with local organizations: Collaborating with local organizations that serve beginner Chinese speakers can help you reach a wider audience. For example, you could partner with community centers, libraries, or other cultural organizations to co-host events and share resources.
6. Provide opportunities for feedback and input: Encourage beginners to provide feedback and input on your events through surveys, focus groups, or other mechanisms. This can help you understand their needs and preferences and make improvements to future events.
7. Offer cultural workshops: Host workshops that teach beginner Chinese speakers about different aspects of Chinese culture, such as calligraphy, painting, or traditional music. This can provide a unique and enjoyable experience for participants while also helping them learn more about the culture.
8. Create a mentorship program: Pair beginners with more advanced Chinese speakers who can act as mentors and provide guidance and support throughout the event. This can help build confidence and foster a sense of community among participants.
9. Use technology to
