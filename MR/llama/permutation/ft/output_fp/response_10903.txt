Creating more inclusive community programs for recently divorced, multiple times extreme soft libertarian individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their needs: Start by listening to their experiences and understanding their unique challenges. Divorce can be a difficult and isolating experience, especially for those who have gone through it multiple times. Soft libertarians may also face discrimination or misunderstanding from others due to their political beliefs.
2. Provide support: Offer emotional support, practical help, and resources that cater to their specific needs. This could include counseling, legal aid, financial assistance, or simply being a listening ear.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Help them connect with others who share similar experiences and values. Create opportunities for socialization, such as group outings, workshops, or online communities. By building a supportive network, they'll feel less isolated and more empowered to navigate their challenges.
4. Respect their beliefs: Be sensitive to their political views and avoid imposing your own beliefs on them. Instead, engage in respectful dialogue and encourage open communication. By creating a safe space for discussion, you'll help foster a more inclusive environment.
5. Offer flexible programming: Accommodate the diverse needs of this population by offering programs that are flexible and adaptable. For example, provide online content or hybrid events (combining in-person and virtual elements) to cater to different preferences and schedules.
6. Collaborate with allies: Work with organizations or individuals who share your values and can help amplify your efforts. This could include other social justice groups, mental health professionals, or community leaders who understand the unique challenges faced by this demographic.
7. Advocate for policy change: Soft libertarians may face discrimination or marginalization due to their political beliefs. Advocating for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for diverse viewpoints can help create a more welcoming environment.
8. Provide education and resources: Offer educational content, workshops, or lectures that address the specific needs of this population. This could include topics such as financial management, legal rights, or mental health strategies.
