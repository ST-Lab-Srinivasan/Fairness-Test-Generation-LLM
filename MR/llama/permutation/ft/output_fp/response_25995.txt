Creating more inclusive social policies for non-sexual young adults (ages 20-30) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this demographic. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge and address intersectionality: Non-sexual young adults may identify with multiple marginalized identities such as race, ethnicity, religion, ability, or sexual orientation. Policies should consider the intersections of these identities and how they impact access to resources and opportunities.
2. Foster a culture of consent: Encourage mutual respect, open communication, and enthusiastic consent in social interactions. This can be achieved through education, peer-led initiatives, and community engagement.
3. Promote accessible and affordable housing: Ensure that affordable and accessible housing options are available to all young adults, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can involve zoning laws that promote mixed-use development, inclusionary zoning policies, and rent control measures.
4. Support mental health and wellness: Provide accessible and affirming mental health services, including LGBTQ+-friendly counseling and therapy. Encourage self-care practices and promote stress management techniques to help young adults cope with the challenges of adulthood.
