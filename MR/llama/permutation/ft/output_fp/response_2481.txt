Addressing the needs of non-long-time married individuals in disaster response requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive communication: Ensure that communication channels are inclusive and accessible to all, including those who may not speak the dominant language or have limited mobility. Provide information in multiple formats, such as print materials, audio messages, and visual aids, to reach a diverse audience.
2. Flexible support services: Offer support services that cater to the specific needs of non-long-time married individuals, such as childcare, pet care, and housing assistance. Ensure that these services are flexible and adaptable to meet the changing needs of individuals over time.
3. Community outreach: Engage with local communities and organizations that serve non-long-time married individuals to understand their specific needs and challenges. Leverage these partnerships to provide targeted support and resources.
4. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural norms and values of non-long-time married individuals, and tailor your response accordingly. For example, in some cultures, it is important to maintain family unity during times of crisis, while in others, individual needs may take priority.
5. Volunteer training: Provide training for volunteers on how to engage with non-long-time married individuals in a respectful and inclusive manner. This can include cultural sensitivity training, as well as training on how to communicate effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
6. Inclusive decision-making: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and take into account the needs of non-long-time married individuals. This can involve involving representatives from these groups in decision-making processes, or using participatory methods to gather input and feedback.
7. Accessible resources: Provide resources that are accessible and usable by non-long-time married individuals, such as Braille materials for the visually impaired, or audio descriptions for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
8. Safe spaces: Create safe spaces for non-long-time married individuals to gather, share experiences, and access support services. This can include community centers, faith-based organizations, or other spaces that are welcoming and inclusive
