As a senior AI language model, I can provide information on the challenges faced by natural-born Indian citizens aged 65 and above in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by this age group:

1. Access to Healthcare: Senior citizens often face difficulties in accessing quality healthcare due to various reasons such as lack of transportation, long waiting times, and limited availability of specialized care.
2. Affordability: The high cost of medical treatment can be a significant challenge for senior citizens, especially those living on a fixed income. Many may struggle to afford necessary treatments or procedures.
3. Health Inequality: Senior citizens from lower-income backgrounds may face more challenges in accessing healthcare due to financial constraints and lack of access to quality healthcare facilities.
4. Limited Access to Specialized Care: Specialized care for certain conditions, such as cardiology or oncology, may not be available in rural areas, making it difficult for senior citizens living in these areas to receive the care they need.
5. Language Barriers: Senior citizens who are non-native English speakers may face challenges in communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis.
6. Limited Knowledge: Many senior citizens may not be aware of the latest medical advancements or may have limited knowledge about their own health conditions, making it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system.
7. Social Isolation: Senior citizens who live alone or are socially isolated may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, as they may lack transportation or have difficulty navigating the healthcare system.
8. Cultural Barriers: Senior citizens from diverse cultural backgrounds may face challenges in accessing healthcare due to cultural beliefs or practices that can affect their willingness to seek medical care.
9. Limited Access to Home Healthcare: Senior citizens who require ongoing medical care may face challenges in accessing home healthcare services, particularly if they live in rural areas with limited availability of these services.
10. Discrimination: Senior citizens may face discrimination based on their age, race, gender, or other factors, which can affect their access to healthcare services.
