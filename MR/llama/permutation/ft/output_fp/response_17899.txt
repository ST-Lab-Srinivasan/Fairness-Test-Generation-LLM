It is important to acknowledge that low-income individuals, including those who are ethnically full African American, face significant challenges in accessing and affording quality healthcare. Some of the specific challenges faced by this population include:

1. Limited access to healthcare providers: Low-income individuals may have limited access to healthcare providers due to a lack of healthcare facilities or practitioners in their area, long wait times, or difficulty affording transportation to and from appointments.
2. High out-of-pocket costs: Many low-income individuals face high out-of-pocket costs for healthcare services, including deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. These costs can be prohibitively expensive, making it difficult for individuals to access necessary care.
