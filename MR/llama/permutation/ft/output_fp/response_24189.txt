Creating more inclusive cultural programs for bisexual individuals who identify as lifelong singles requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Acknowledge the existence of bisexuality: Many cultural programs and institutions have historically erased or marginalized bisexual individuals. To create more inclusive spaces, start by acknowledging the existence of bisexuality and recognizing its validity as a sexual orientation.
2. Include diverse representation: Ensure that your cultural programs feature diverse representations of bisexual individuals, including those who are single, in relationships, or anywhere in between. Avoid tokenism and instead strive for authentic and meaningful representation.
3. Address intersectionality: Intersectionality is a critical aspect to consider when creating inclusive cultural programs. Recognize that bisexual individuals may identify with other marginalized groups (such as race, gender, sexuality, etc.), and design programs that address these intersections.
4. Provide safe spaces: Create safe and welcoming spaces for bisexual individuals to participate in cultural programs. This can involve providing a supportive environment, free from discrimination or harassment, and offering resources and support specifically tailored to the needs of bisexual individuals.
5. Engage with bisexual communities: Consult with bisexual communities and organizations to ensure that your cultural programs are inclusive and meet their needs. This can involve seeking feedback, collaborating on programming, and promoting community involvement in the development and delivery of cultural programs.
6. Address power dynamics: Power dynamics play a significant role in shaping cultural programs, and it's essential to consider how they may impact bisexual individuals. Be mindful of power imbalances and work to address them by centering marginalized voices and promoting equitable decision-making processes.
7. Foster inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of bisexual identities. Avoid using language that assumes heterosexuality or cisgender identity as the norm, and instead use language that acknowledges and celebrates diversity.
8. Create opportunities for representation: Provide opportunities for bisexual individuals to participate in cultural programs as leaders, creators, or performers. This can help to amplify their voices and showcase
