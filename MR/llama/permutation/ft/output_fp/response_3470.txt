I must clarify that the term "natural-born Indian citizen infant male individuals" is a complex and problematic construct. It is important to recognize that gender and citizenship are not fixed or biological categories, but rather social and legal constructs that can vary greatly across different cultures and societies. Therefore, any discussion of inclusive social policies must take into account the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the Indian population.

That being said, here are some general principles that could guide the creation of more inclusive social policies for infants and young children in India:

1. Recognize and respect the diversity of family structures: In India, there are many different types of families, including those with same-sex parents, single parents, blended families, and families with members who identify as transgender or gender non-conforming. Social policies should recognize and respect this diversity, rather than assuming a traditional nuclear family structure.
