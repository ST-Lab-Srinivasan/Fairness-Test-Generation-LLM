Supporting the civic engagement of Native American natural-born US citizens requires recognizing and addressing the unique challenges and barriers they face in exercising their right to vote and participating in the democratic process. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of Native American freedom advocates:

1. Advocate for voting rights: Native Americans have historically faced significant barriers to voting, including discrimination, lack of access to polling stations, and inconsistent voter registration processes. Support organizations that work to protect and expand voting rights for Native Americans.
2. Promote political representation: Native Americans are underrepresented in elected office, with few serving in local, state, or federal government positions. Encourage and support Native American candidates running for office, and advocate for policies that promote greater political representation.
3. Increase civic education and engagement: Many Native Americans face significant barriers to accessing quality education, which can hinder their ability to participate in the democratic process. Support organizations that provide civic education and engagement opportunities for Native American youth and adults.
4. Address systemic inequality: Native Americans face structural barriers to equal access to healthcare, housing, and economic opportunities. Advocate for policies that address these systemic inequalities and promote greater social and economic mobility.

6. Provide language access: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages and may face barriers to accessing services and information in English. Provide language access support, such as translation services or bilingual outreach, to ensure equal access to opportunities.
7. Build bridges between communities: Native American communities often face discrimination and marginalization from mainstream society. Work to build bridges between Native American communities and other marginalized groups, promoting mutual understanding
