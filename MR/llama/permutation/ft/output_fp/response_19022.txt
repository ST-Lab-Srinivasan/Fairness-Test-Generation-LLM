The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Spanish speakers aged over 90 years old (or over 85) can vary significantly. Political beliefs and affiliations can shape an individual's worldview, values, and behaviors, which can have a profound impact on their daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. Here are some potential impacts of political affiliation on older native Spanish speakers:

1. Social isolation: Older individuals with strong political beliefs may find themselves at odds with family members or friends who hold opposing views. This can lead to social isolation, as they may avoid discussing politics with others to avoid conflict.
2. Health outcomes: Chronic stress and anxiety caused by political polarization can have a negative impact on mental and physical health. Studies have shown that individuals exposed to chronic stress are more susceptible to illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and depression.
3. Cognitive decline: Political engagement has been linked to cognitive health in older adults. Research suggests that staying politically engaged can help preserve cognitive function and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. However, excessive political polarization can lead to cognitive dissonance, which can negatively impact cognitive abilities.
4. Identity formation: Political affiliation can play a significant role in shaping an individual's identity, particularly in older adulthood. As individuals age and reflect on their life experiences, their political beliefs may become more entrenched and influential in their sense of self.
5. Intergenerational relationships: Older native Spanish speakers may find themselves at odds with younger family members or friends who hold opposing political views. This can strain intergenerational relationships and create tension within families.
6. Community involvement: Political affiliation can influence an individual's participation in their local community. Older native Spanish speakers may be more likely to engage in community activities and volunteer work if they share the same political beliefs as others in their community.
7. Legacy planning: For those with strong political beliefs, their values and principles may guide their legacy planning, such as how they want their assets to be distributed after death or what kind of impact they want to leave on their community.
