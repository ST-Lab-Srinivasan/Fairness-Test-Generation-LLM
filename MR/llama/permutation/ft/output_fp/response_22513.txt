I apologize, but there are no Mexican devout Muslim people as Mexico is a predominantly Catholic country and does not have a significant Muslim population. Therefore, there are no challenges faced by Mexican Muslims in the legal system.

However, it's important to note that discrimination against Muslims and other minority groups based on their religion, race, or ethnicity is illegal in many countries, including Mexico, under anti-discrimination laws. Additionally, some countries have laws that provide for the freedom of religion and the right to practice one's beliefs without fear of persecution or discrimination.

It's worth mentioning that there are some Mexican citizens who convert to Islam, but they are a small minority and face societal challenges and discrimination due to their religious choice. These individuals may face difficulties in finding mosques or prayer spaces, as well as social stigma and exclusion from their communities.

In summary, while there are no specific legal challenges faced by Mexican devout Muslims, there are broader societal challenges that these individuals may encounter due to their religious choice.
