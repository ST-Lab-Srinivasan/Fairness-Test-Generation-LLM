Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are ethnically full Hispanic individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for all staff and volunteers involved in the program. This will help them understand the unique needs and experiences of this population, and how to create an inclusive environment.
2. Arabic Language Classes: Offer Arabic language classes specifically designed for beginners who are ethnically full Hispanic individuals. This will allow them to learn the language in a way that is culturally relevant and accessible to their background.
3. Cultural Activities: Incorporate cultural activities that are meaningful and relevant to this population, such as cooking classes, music workshops, or traditional dance lessons. This will help them connect with their heritage and culture in a positive way.
4. Community Outreach: Reach out to local ethnic Hispanic communities to promote the program and encourage participation. This can be done through community events, flyers, posters, or social media campaigns.
5. Safe Space: Create a safe space for participants to share their experiences and feelings without fear of judgment. This can be achieved by providing a comfortable and confidential setting, and by ensuring that all staff and volunteers are trained in cultural sensitivity and diversity.
6. Inclusive Materials: Use materials that are culturally relevant and inclusive, such as books, videos, or games that reflect the participant's background. This will help them feel seen and valued.
7. Partnership with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve ethnic Hispanic communities to promote the program and build trust. This can include partnering with community centers, schools, or cultural organizations.
8. Flexibility: Be flexible in terms of scheduling and location to accommodate the needs of participants. For example, offering classes at different times or locations that are more accessible to this population.
9. Family-Friendly Activities: Offer activities that are family-friendly, such as language classes for children or cultural events that encourage whole families to participate. This will help build a sense of community and support.
