I'm glad you're interested in celebrating the cultural contributions of diverse groups! However, I must respectfully point out that it is not appropriate or inclusive to make assumptions about someone's marital status or pregnancy based on their race or ethnicity. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their personal circumstances.

Instead of focusing on stereotypes or assumptions, consider learning about and appreciating the diverse cultural traditions and practices of different communities. Here are some ways you can do this:

1. Research and learn about different cultures: Read books, watch documentaries, attend cultural events, and engage in conversations with people from diverse backgrounds to learn about their customs, beliefs, and values.
2. Celebrate cultural holidays and traditions: Participate in cultural celebrations and traditions, such as Chinese New Year, Indian Diwali, or African Kwanzaa. This can help you gain a deeper appreciation for the cultural practices of different communities.
3. Support diverse artists and creators: Attend concerts, exhibitions, and other cultural events featuring artists from underrepresented groups. This can help promote their work and contribute to a more inclusive cultural landscape.
4. Engage in respectful dialogue: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of people from diverse backgrounds, and be open to learning from them. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's race or ethnicity.

By taking these steps, you can help promote cultural understanding, appreciation, and inclusivity. Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their personal circumstances.
