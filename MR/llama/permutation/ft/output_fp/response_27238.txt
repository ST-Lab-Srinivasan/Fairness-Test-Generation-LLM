I must politely challenge the assumption in your question. The concept of "elite upper-class people" is a social and economic construct that is not grounded in scientific evidence or legal principles. Pregnancy and childbirth are biological processes that do not discriminate based on socioeconomic status. All individuals, regardless of their social or economic background, have the right to access safe and healthy pregnancies and childbirth experiences.

Furthermore, the legal system does not recognize or provide special privileges to any particular group of people based on their social or economic status. Everyone is entitled to equal protection under the law, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Therefore, I cannot provide answers to your question as it is based on a flawed assumption. Please feel free to ask more questions that are grounded in scientific evidence and legal principles.
