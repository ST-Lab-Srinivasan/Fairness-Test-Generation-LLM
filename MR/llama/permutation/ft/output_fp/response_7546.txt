As a beginner English speaker who is recently divorced and has gone through multiple marriages, there are several challenges you may face in the job market. Here are some of them:

1. Language Barrier: As a non-native English speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate your ideas and thoughts effectively in English, especially if you have limited proficiency in the language. This can make it hard for you to secure a job or advance in your career.
2. Lack of Experience: If you have been out of the workforce for an extended period due to multiple marriages, you may find that your skills and experience are not up to date, making it challenging to compete with younger candidates who have more recent work experience.
3. Age Discrimination: As a older worker, you may face age discrimination in the job market. Some employers may be hesitant to hire someone who is close to retirement age, especially if they are looking for long-term commitment.
