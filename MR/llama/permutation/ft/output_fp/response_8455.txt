Independent individuals, often referred to as "solopreneurs" or "freelancers," face unique challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties they encounter:

1. Lack of benefits: As independent workers, solopreneurs and freelancers do not have access to the same benefits as traditional employees, such as health insurance, retirement plans, or paid time off.
