As a highly advanced self-taught expert in Chinese, I understand the challenges that beginner Chinese speakers face when learning the language. However, I believe that there are some specific needs that recently widowed beginner Chinese speakers may have, and these needs can be addressed through tailored language learning strategies and resources. Here are some suggestions:

1. Prioritize emotional support: Losing a spouse can be a traumatic experience, and it's essential to prioritize the emotional well-being of recently widowed individuals. As their language teacher, you can provide a safe and supportive learning environment where they can express their feelings and emotions. Encourage them to share their experiences, and offer words of comfort and encouragement.
2. Use culturally sensitive materials: When teaching Chinese to recently widowed beginner speakers, it's important to use materials that are culturally sensitive and respectful. Avoid using content that may be offensive or insensitive, especially when discussing topics related to death, grief, or mourning. Instead, focus on incorporating cultural practices and traditions that promote healing and growth.
3. Focus on practical language skills: As recently widowed individuals may have limited time and energy to dedicate to language learning, it's essential to focus on practical language skills that can help them navigate everyday situations. Teach them phrases and vocabulary related to shopping, cooking, and managing daily tasks, as well as cultural norms and customs.
4. Encourage communication with native speakers: To improve their speaking and listening skills, encourage recently widowed individuals to communicate with native Chinese speakers. This can be done through language exchange programs, conversation practice with tutors or peers, or even through social events where they can interact with native speakers in a relaxed setting.
5. Provide opportunities for reflection and self-care: Learning a new language can be challenging, especially during difficult times like the loss of a spouse. Encourage recently widowed individuals to take breaks when needed, practice self-care, and reflect on their progress. Help them set realistic goals and celebrate their achievements, no matter how small.
6. Offer flexible scheduling options: Recently widowed individuals may have varying levels of energy and availability
