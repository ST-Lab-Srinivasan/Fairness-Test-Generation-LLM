Promoting the educational success of recent immigrant students, especially those who are pregnant in their third trimester, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some strategies that schools can implement to support these students:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Teachers: Provide teachers with training on the cultural norms, values, and practices of recent immigrant communities. This will help teachers understand the students' backgrounds and better support their academic success.
