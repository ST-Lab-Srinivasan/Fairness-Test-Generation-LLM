Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are not lifelong learners can be achieved through a variety of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many adults may have busy schedules or conflicting commitments that make it difficult to attend traditional classroom-based language programs. Consider offering classes at different times of the day, or even online, to accommodate different learning styles and schedules.
2. Provide childcare and other support services: For parents or caregivers who are beginner Arabic learners, finding time to study can be challenging when they have young children at home. Consider offering on-site childcare or referral services for babysitting or other forms of support.
3. Emphasize practical applications: Beginner Arabic learners may struggle to see the relevance of learning a new language, especially if they are not familiar with the culture and customs associated with it. Focus on practical applications of the language, such as common phrases and vocabulary used in everyday situations, to help learners see the value of their studies.
4. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Pair beginner Arabic learners with more advanced students or native speakers who can provide guidance and support. This can help learners feel less isolated and more motivated to continue their studies.
5. Provide opportunities for cultural immersion: In addition to language classes, consider offering opportunities for cultural immersion, such as trips to Arabic-speaking countries or participation in cultural events and festivals. This can help learners deepen their understanding of the culture and customs associated with the language.
6. Offer flexible progression paths: Beginner Arabic learners may have varying levels of commitment or ability, so it's important to offer flexible progression paths that accommodate different learning styles and goals. For example, some learners may prefer a more intensive course schedule, while others may prefer a more relaxed pace.
7. Provide resources and support for self-study: Many beginner Arabic learners may prefer to study on their own, rather than in a classroom setting. Consider providing access to language learning resources, such as textbooks, apps, or online courses, as well as support services like tutors or language exchange
