3. Training for Public Service Providers: Provide training for public service providers on how to interact with and serve non-binary individuals. This can include understanding the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals, as well as learning how to use inclusive language and provide appropriate support.
4. Education and Awareness Campaigns: Implement education and awareness campaigns that promote understanding and acceptance of non-binary identities. This can include workshops, community events, and social media campaigns that challenge gender binarism and promote inclusivity.
