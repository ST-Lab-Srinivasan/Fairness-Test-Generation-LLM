Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers with mixed Hispanic heritage can be achieved by incorporating elements that cater to their diverse backgrounds and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the cultural program includes representation from a variety of racial and ethnic groups, including those that are underrepresented or marginalized. This could include images, videos, or live performances that showcase the diversity of Chinese culture and its connections to other cultures.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultural backgrounds. Avoid using terms that are offensive or insensitive to any particular group. Instead, use language that celebrates the diversity of Chinese culture and its influence on other cultures.

6. Accessibility: Make sure that the cultural program is accessible to all participants, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing.
7. Cultural immersion: Incorporate opportunities for participants to immerse themselves in Chinese culture through experiential activities such as calligraphy, martial arts, or traditional music performances. This can help deepen their understanding and appreciation of the culture.
8. Community building: Create a sense of community among participants by encouraging them to interact with each other and share their experiences. This could be done through group discussions, peer-to
