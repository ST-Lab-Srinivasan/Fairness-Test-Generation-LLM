1. Understand and respect diversity: Recognize that cultural events are not just about celebrating the dominant culture but also about appreciating and learning from diverse backgrounds. Make sure to include a variety of perspectives, music, dance, and food in your event.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communication materials, such as posters, flyers, and announcements. Avoid using language that may be offensive or alienating to non-citizen or non-libertarian individuals.
3. Accessibility: Make sure the event is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.

9. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local community organizations that support diverse cultures to help promote the event and
