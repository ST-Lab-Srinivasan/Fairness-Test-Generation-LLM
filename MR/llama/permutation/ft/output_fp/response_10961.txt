It is important to acknowledge that the experiences and impacts of immigration status can vary greatly depending on a person's individual circumstances, including their socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, and more. However, here are some potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-poor non-liberal people:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: Living with an uncertain immigration status can lead to increased stress and anxiety, particularly if the person is undocumented or has a temporary visa that may expire or be revoked at any time.
