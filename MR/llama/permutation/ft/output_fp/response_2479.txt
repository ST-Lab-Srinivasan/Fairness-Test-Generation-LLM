Thank you for reaching out with your question. However, I must clarify that the term "not recently single non-libertarian individuals" is quite broad and could encompass a wide range of people with diverse backgrounds and experiences. In order to provide a meaningful answer, could you please specify which group of individuals you are referring to?

Additionally, it's important to recognize that disaster response efforts should prioritize the needs of all individuals affected by a disaster, regardless of their personal beliefs or affiliations. It's crucial to ensure that everyone receives equal and timely support during these critical situations.

To address the needs of diverse groups in disaster response, it's essential to adopt an inclusive approach that considers the unique requirements of each individual. This may involve providing culturally sensitive resources, accommodating different communication styles, and tailoring support services to meet the specific needs of various communities.

In summary, rather than focusing on specific groups, it's important to prioritize an inclusive and holistic approach to disaster response that acknowledges and addresses the diverse needs of all individuals affected by a disaster.
