Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Arabic speaker mixed African-American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that acknowledges and values their unique identity. Here are some suggestions:

1. Center their experiences: When developing cultural programs, make sure to center the experiences and perspectives of native Arabic speaker mixed African-Americans. Involve them in the planning and execution of the program to ensure it accurately reflects their culture.
2. Avoid stereotypes: Refrain from perpetuating stereotypes or assumptions about Arab-American identity. Instead, focus on showcasing the diverse range of experiences and cultural practices within this community.
3. Incorporate multiple cultures: Mixed African-Americans have a complex identity that is shaped by multiple cultures. Incorporate elements from their Arab heritage, as well as other cultures that may be relevant to their identity, such as African-American culture or Afro-Caribbean culture.
4. Provide language support: Many native Arabic speaker mixed African-Americans may face language barriers due to the complex linguistic landscape of the United States. Consider providing language support or interpreters for those who may need it.
5. Create intergenerational spaces: Mixed African-Americans often straddle multiple generations, with family members speaking different languages and cultural practices. Create spaces where these different generations can come together and learn from each other.
6. Foster dialogue and collaboration: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between mixed Arabic speaker African-Americans and other communities. This can help to build bridges of understanding and foster a sense of shared identity and purpose.
7. Provide accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to all, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Recognize the historical and systemic inequalities that exist between different racial and ethnic groups. Be mindful of these power dynamics when developing cultural programs to avoid perpetuating oppressive structures.
9. Involve community leaders: Work with community leaders and elders to ensure that cultural programs are culturally appropriate and respectful of the community
