Promoting the educational success of mixed Hispanic heritage non-conservative students requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies that educators and policymakers can consider:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide teachers with training on culturally responsive teaching practices that recognize and value the diversity of students' backgrounds, experiences, and identities. This approach can help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for mixed Hispanic heritage non-conservative students.
2. Multicultural education: Incorporate multicultural education into the curriculum to promote understanding, empathy, and respect for diverse cultures. This can involve teaching about the histories, traditions, and contributions of different ethnic and racial groups, including those from mixed Hispanic heritage backgrounds.
3. Diverse representation in materials: Use diverse representation in educational materials, such as textbooks, videos, and other resources. This can help students see themselves and their experiences reflected in the curriculum and feel more connected to the learning process.
4. Identity-safe spaces: Create identity-safe spaces where students can express themselves without fear of judgment or marginalization. This can involve creating inclusive classroom environments, promoting respectful dialogue, and providing support for students who may be struggling with their identities.
5. Mentorship and role models: Provide mentorship and role models that reflect the diversity of students' backgrounds. This can involve pairing students with mentors from similar experiences or providing opportunities for students to connect with professionals and leaders from diverse backgrounds.
6. Addressing systemic barriers: Address systemic barriers, such as inadequate funding, lack of resources, and biases within the education system, that can impact the educational success of mixed Hispanic heritage non-conservative students. This can involve advocating for policy changes and resource allocation to better support these students.
7. Parental involvement: Encourage parental involvement in their children's education by providing opportunities for parents to engage in the educational process, such as through parent-teacher conferences, volunteer work, or other activities. This can help build a stronger sense of community and support around students.
