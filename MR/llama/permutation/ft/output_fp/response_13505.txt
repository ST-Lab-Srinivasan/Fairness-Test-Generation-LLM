As a native French speaker and beginner English speaker in the healthcare system, there are several challenges that I face. Here are some of them:

1. Language barriers: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier between French and English. As a beginner English speaker, I often struggle to communicate effectively with healthcare professionals who are more fluent in English. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can be detrimental to my healthcare experience.
