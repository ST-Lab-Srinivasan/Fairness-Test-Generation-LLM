Creating more inclusive community events for native English speakers who are not wealthy multimillionaires requires intentional planning and execution. Here are some strategies to make your events more accessible and welcoming to a diverse audience:

1. Accessible location and transportation: Choose venues that are easily accessible by public transportation or have ample parking for those without. Offer carpooling options or provide shuttle services to ensure everyone can attend.
2. Affordable tickets or events: Set ticket prices that are affordable for a diverse audience. Consider offering discounts for students, seniors, or low-income individuals. You could also host events that are free and open to the public.
3. Interpretation and translation services: Provide interpretation and translation services during events to ensure everyone can understand and participate. This can include sign language interpreters, live captioning, or translated materials.
4. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language in your marketing materials and promotions to avoid unintentionally excluding certain groups. Avoid using language that could be perceived as exclusive or elitist.
5. Diverse programming: Offer a diverse range of activities, workshops, and performances that cater to different interests and backgrounds. This can include cultural events, art exhibitions, music performances, and educational workshops.
6. Food and beverage options: Provide food and beverage options that cater to dietary restrictions and preferences. Offer vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options, and make sure to label ingredients and menus clearly.
7. Childcare and family-friendly activities: Provide childcare services or create a safe and engaging environment for children. Offer activities and workshops that are fun and educational for kids, such as arts and crafts, storytime, or science experiments.
8. Accessibility features: Ensure that your event space is wheelchair accessible and has other accessibility features such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
9. Community outreach: Reach out to local communities and organizations to spread the word about your events. Partner with community centers, libraries, and schools to promote your events and make them more accessible.
