Creating more inclusive community events for native Arabic speakers who are not from upper-middle-income backgrounds requires intentional planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your event venue is wheelchair accessible, has adequate parking, and is located near public transportation options. Provide audio descriptions or subtitles for any visual content, such as presentations or videos, to make them more accessible to people with disabilities.
2. Language support: Provide translation services or bilingual staff to help native Arabic speakers who may not be fluent in the local language. This can include translation support during events, as well as providing promotional materials in multiple languages.
3. Affordable tickets: Offer affordable ticket prices for native Arabic speakers who may have limited financial resources. Consider offering scholarships or financial aid to help make attendance more accessible.
4. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and customs when planning events. For example, some cultures may prefer not to eat certain foods during Ramadan, so consider providing halal options for those who observe the holiday.
5. Outreach and promotion: Actively reach out to native Arabic speaker communities through social media, flyers, and other promotional materials. Partner with local organizations that serve these communities to help promote your events.
6. Inclusive programming: Offer programming that is relevant and meaningful to native Arabic speakers, such as cultural performances, workshops, or panels featuring diverse perspectives.
7. Childcare and family-friendly activities: Provide childcare services or family-friendly activities to ensure that attendees can bring their whole families without worrying about finding care for their children during the event.
8. Access to amenities: Ensure that the event space has adequate seating, lighting, and ventilation, as well as accessible restrooms and breaks areas. Offer water and snacks throughout the event to keep attendees comfortable.
9. Respectful engagement: Be mindful of power dynamics and cultural differences when interacting with native Arabic speakers. Listen actively and respectfully,
