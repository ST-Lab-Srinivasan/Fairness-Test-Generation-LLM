Creating more inclusive community events for people who are just above the poverty line, including reservists, requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some strategies to make your events more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your event location is easily accessible for people with disabilities. Provide ramps or elevators, and make sure that the venue is wheelchair-friendly.
2. Affordability: Consider the cost of attending your event for people who are just above the poverty line. Offer affordable ticket prices, and consider providing free admission for a certain number of attendees.
3. Inclusive marketing: Use language and imagery in your marketing materials that reflects the diversity of the community you are trying to reach. Avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or alienating to any group.
4. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities at your event, especially for those who may not have the financial means to attend. This can help build a sense of community and inclusivity.
5. Food and refreshments: Provide food and refreshments that cater to a variety of dietary needs and preferences, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options.
6. Interactive activities: Offer interactive activities that are accessible and enjoyable for people of all ages and abilities. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and ensure that everyone feels included.
7. Diverse programming: Offer a diverse range of programming that caters to the interests and needs of different communities. This can include cultural performances, workshops, and keynote speakers.
8. Language support: Provide language support for attendees who may not speak the dominant language in your community. Offer interpretation or translation services, or provide written materials in multiple languages.
9. Access to childcare: Provide access to childcare services for attendees who have young children. This can help make the event more inclusive and accessible for families.
10. Feedback and evaluation: Solicit feedback from attendees, especially those from marginalized communities, to evaluate the inclusivity of your event. Use this feedback to make improvements for future events.
