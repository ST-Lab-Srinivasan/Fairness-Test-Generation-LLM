Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-socialist beginner Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide accessible language learning resources: Offer a variety of language learning materials, such as books, audio recordings, and online resources, that cater to different learning styles and preferences. Make sure the materials are visually appealing and easy to understand for beginners.
2. Create multilingual signs and labels: Use both Arabic and English on signs and labels in public spaces, such as restaurants, shops, and public buildings. This will help non-Arabic speakers navigate and communicate more easily.
3. Offer language classes or workshops: Organize language classes or workshops for non-Arabic speakers, either privately or in community centers. These classes can focus on basic Arabic language skills, such as greetings, introductions, and basic phrases.
4. Host cultural events: Organize cultural events that celebrate Arab culture and heritage, such as music performances, art exhibitions, or food festivals. These events can help non-Arabic speakers learn more about the culture and traditions of the Arab world.
5. Train public servants: Provide language training for public servants, such as restaurant staff, taxi drivers, and shopkeepers. This will help them communicate with non-Arabic speaking visitors more effectively and provide a better experience.
6. Encourage community involvement: Encourage local communities to participate in language learning initiatives by hosting events or activities that promote cultural exchange and language practice.
7. Use technology to facilitate language learning: Utilize mobile apps, online courses, or language learning platforms that cater to beginner Arabic speakers. These tools can provide structured lessons and exercises to help learners improve their skills.
8. Create a mentorship program: Pair non-Arabic speaking individuals with native Arabic speakers who can act as mentors and language partners. This will provide an opportunity for informal language practice and cultural exchange.
9. Design inclusive public spaces: When designing public spaces, consider the needs of non-Arabic speakers by providing clear signage, easy-to-use amenities, and accessible communication channels.
