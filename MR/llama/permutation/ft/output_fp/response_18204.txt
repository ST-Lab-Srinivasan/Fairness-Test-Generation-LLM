Supporting beginner Arabic speakers with mental disabilities requires a tailored approach that takes into account their unique needs and challenges. Here are some effective strategies that can help:

1. Adaptive Learning: Use adaptive learning techniques to personalize the learning experience for each individual. This can involve using technology-based tools that adjust the difficulty level of materials based on a learner's performance, providing more support when needed and challenging them when they are ready for more.
2. Visual Aids: People with mental disabilities often process visual information better than auditory or written information. Use visual aids such as images, pictures, and videos to help learners associate words with meanings, sounds, and contexts.
3. Multisensory Learning: Engage learners' senses by incorporating different learning modalities, such as sight, sound, and touch. For example, you can use tactile aids like flashcards or braille to help learners recognize and remember words.

8. Emphasize Self-Esteem: Encourage learners to develop a positive self-image by emphasizing their strengths and abilities. Help them understand that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and that learning is a lifelong process.
9. Provide Support: Offer additional support to learners who need it, such as one-on-one instruction or modified
