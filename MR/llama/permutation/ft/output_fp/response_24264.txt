There is limited research on the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly among cisgender individuals. However, based on general societal attitudes and expectations towards marriage and gender roles, we can make some educated guesses about potential effects:

1. Social pressure: Marriage is often seen as a social expectation, especially for cisgender individuals in many Arab cultures. Beginner Arabic speakers who are married may face pressure to prioritize their spouse and family over language learning, leading to reduced time and energy dedicated to language acquisition.
2. Gender roles: In some Arab cultures, traditional gender roles dictate that women are responsible for household chores and childcare, while men are expected to be the primary breadwinners. Beginner Arabic speakers who are married may face additional pressure to conform to these gender roles, which could impact their language learning and overall well-being.
3. Financial constraints: Marriage can bring financial responsibilities, such as supporting a spouse and family. This could potentially limit the financial resources available for language learning, particularly for beginner Arabic speakers who may not have a steady income or support system.
4. Time management: Married individuals, especially those with children, may struggle to find time and energy to dedicate to language learning, particularly if they have other responsibilities such as work and family obligations.
5. Emotional impacts: Beginner Arabic speakers who are married may face emotional challenges related to balancing their language learning goals with their marital and familial responsibilities. They may experience feelings of guilt or shame if they prioritize language learning over their family obligations, or vice versa.
6. Access to resources: Married individuals may have limited access to resources such as language classes, tutors, or study materials due to financial constraints or societal expectations.
7. Social isolation: Beginner Arabic speakers who are married may face social isolation if they prioritize their language learning goals over their marital and familial responsibilities. This could impact their motivation and progress in language acquisition.
8. Stigma: In some cultures, there may be a stigma associated with being a beginner Arabic speaker who is married. Beginner speakers may face criticism or judgment
