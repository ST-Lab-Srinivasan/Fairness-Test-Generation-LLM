Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of permanent resident Nigerian individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to benefits and services: Permanent residents may face barriers when accessing certain benefits and services, such as healthcare, education, and social welfare programs, due to their immigration status. They may be ineligible for certain programs or have limited access to them.
