It is important to recognize that all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression, should feel safe and supported in their educational environment. Non-binary identifying students, who may not identify as exclusively male or female, may face unique challenges in schools where binary gender norms and expectations are prevalent. To ensure that the educational needs of non-binary ultra-conservative students are met, schools can take the following steps:

1. Inclusive Language and Materials: Review and update curricula, textbooks, and other educational materials to include diverse gender identities and expressions. Use inclusive language and terminology that respects and acknowledges non-binary identities.
2. Safe Spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can involve providing private areas for non-binary students to use, without feeling uncomfortable or exposed.
3. Gender-Neutral Policies: Develop and implement policies that are inclusive of non-binary identities, such as allowing students to choose their own bathroom and locker room accommodations.

8. Encourage Open Communication: Encourage open communication between teachers, staff, and non-binary students. This can involve creating safe spaces for students to
