Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of people living in deep poverty, including those who are classified as "extreme poor" or "moderate poor." Here are some potential effects:

1. Lack of access to basic necessities: People with precarious immigration status may struggle to access basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter. They may face barriers in obtaining government-subsidized housing, food assistance programs, or other forms of support due to their immigration status.
2. Limited job opportunities: Many people with precarious immigration status face significant barriers when seeking employment. They may be denied work permits or facing discrimination in the workplace, which can limit their ability to earn a living wage and climb out of poverty.
3. Inadequate healthcare: People with precarious immigration status may have limited access to healthcare services, including preventive care, medical treatment, or mental health support. This can exacerbate health problems and limit their ability to manage chronic conditions.
4. Social isolation: Living in poverty and facing barriers to employment, education, and healthcare can lead to social isolation. This can further erode their sense of well-being and community connection.
5. Increased vulnerability to exploitation: People with precarious immigration status may be more susceptible to exploitation by unscrupulous employers or landlords, who may take advantage of their vulnerable position.
6. Limited access to education: Children and youth with precarious immigration status may face barriers in accessing quality education, which can limit their future opportunities for economic mobility.
7. Insecurity and stress: Living with the constant fear of deportation or other immigration-related consequences can create a state of chronic stress and insecurity, which can have significant impacts on mental and physical health.
8. Difficulty building social capital: People with precarious immigration status may find it challenging to build social connections and networks, which can limit their access to resources and support.
9. Limited political voice: Marginalized communities, including those with precarious immigration status, may face barriers in exercising their political rights and advocating for policies
