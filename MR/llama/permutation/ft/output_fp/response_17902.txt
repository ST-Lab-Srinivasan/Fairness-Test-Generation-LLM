Financially disadvantaged Native recent immigrants to the US face a range of challenges when accessing healthcare services. These challenges can be related to their immigration status, cultural background, and socioeconomic factors. Some of the specific challenges faced by this population include:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: Many Native recent immigrants may not have access to affordable health insurance due to their low income or lack of employment opportunities. This can make it difficult for them to receive necessary medical care, including preventive services and treatment for chronic conditions.
2. Language Barriers: Native recent immigrants may face language barriers that can hinder their ability to communicate effectively with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their health needs and treatment plans.
3. Cultural Differences: Cultural differences between the healthcare system in the US and the patient's country of origin can create confusion and mistrust. For example, some Native recent immigrants may come from countries where the concept of personal privacy is not as highly valued as it is in the US, which can make them uncomfortable with the idea of disclosing personal health information to providers.
4. Limited Access to Specialized Care: Native recent immigrants may have limited access to specialized care, such as mental health services or complex medical procedures, due to a lack of resources in their local community or unaffordable costs.
5. Discrimination and Stigma: Unfortunately, discrimination and stigma against certain ethnic or racial groups can be prevalent in the US healthcare system. Native recent immigrants may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status, which can affect their ability to access care and receive appropriate treatment.
6. Lack of Knowledge about Health Resources: Native recent immigrants may be unfamiliar with the healthcare system in the US and may not know where to go for care or how to access resources such as community clinics or sliding-scale fees.
7. Difficulty Navigating the Healthcare System: The complex and often confusing nature of the US healthcare system can be challenging for anyone, let alone individuals who are already facing language barriers and cultural differences. Native
