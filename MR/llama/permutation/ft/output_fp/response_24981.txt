Promoting the cultural preservation of non-socialist, slightly old (50s) communities can be a challenging task, as these communities are often overlooked and undervalued in modern society. However, there are several strategies that can be employed to help preserve their cultural heritage:

1. Documentation and Archiving: Create a comprehensive database or archive of the community's cultural artifacts, including photographs, oral histories, and written accounts. This will help to ensure that the community's rich cultural heritage is documented and preserved for future generations.
2. Community Engagement: Involve members of the community in the preservation process by hosting workshops, events, and activities that promote cultural exchange and education. Encourage community members to share their stories, traditions, and customs with one another and with outsiders.
3. Cultural Tourism: Develop cultural tourism initiatives that showcase the community's unique cultural heritage to visitors. This can include hosting festivals, exhibitions, and other events that celebrate the community's history and culture.
4. Education and Outreach: Collaborate with local schools and educational institutions to incorporate the community's cultural heritage into curriculum and education programs. This can help to raise awareness and appreciation of the community's cultural traditions among younger generations.
5. Partnerships and Collaborations: Forge partnerships with other organizations, such as cultural centers, museums, and historical societies, to leverage resources and expertise in promoting the community's cultural heritage. Collaborate with local artists, musicians, and performers to create new works that celebrate the community's culture.
6. Digital Preservation: Utilize digital technologies to preserve and promote the community's cultural heritage. Create online archives, databases, and exhibitions that showcase the community's cultural artifacts, oral histories, and written accounts.
7. Community-Led Initiatives: Encourage community members to take an active role in preserving their cultural heritage by leading initiatives such as cultural festivals, historical walks, and traditional craft workshops.
8. Preservation of Cultural Landscapes: Identify and preserve the community's cultural landscapes
