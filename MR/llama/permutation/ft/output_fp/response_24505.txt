Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed African-American nominal Muslim individuals requires understanding and respecting their unique experiences and identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Center the individual's identity: Make sure that the celebration honors and respects the individual's multiple identities, including their race, ethnicity, culture, and religion. Avoid reducing them to a single label or category.
2. Involve diverse leaders and participants: Incorporate leaders and participants from various backgrounds and communities to create a more inclusive and representative celebration. This could include African-American Muslim leaders, mixed-race individuals, and other marginalized communities.
3. Celebrate diverse traditions and practices: Recognize and honor the diversity of cultural practices and traditions within the mixed African-American nominal Muslim community. Incorporate elements from different cultures and religions to create a more inclusive and representative celebration.
4. Create safe spaces for expression: Ensure that the celebration provides a safe and welcoming environment for individuals to express themselves freely, without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could include designated spaces for diverse cultural practices and traditions.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops to raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by mixed African-American nominal Muslim individuals. Encourage empathy and understanding among participants.
6. Incorporate inclusive language and imagery: Use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful of all identities and communities involved in the celebration. Avoid stereotypical or offensive representations that could alienate or marginalize certain groups.
7. Engage in intergenerational dialogue: Involve individuals from different age groups and backgrounds to create a more inclusive and representative celebration. This could include elderly individuals with diverse cultural experiences, as well as younger generations who can bring new perspectives and ideas.
8. Encourage storytelling and oral history: Create opportunities for individuals to share their personal stories and experiences, both within the mixed African-American nominal Muslim community and beyond. This could include creating a digital archive or oral history project to preserve these narratives.
9. Support local businesses and artists
