1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Provide ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms to make it easier for people with mobility impairments to navigate the space.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services, such as interpretation or translation, to ensure that individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language can participate fully. This can include providing headsets or other devices for real-time interpretation, or offering written translations of important information.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of Arabic speakers, especially those from the Middle East or North Africa. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on race, ethnicity, or nationality. Instead, strive to understand and appreciate the diversity of cultures within the Arabic-speaking world.

5. Education and Training: Offer education and training programs for public space staff and volunteers on how to create inclusive environments for Arabic speakers. This can include workshops on cultural competence, language access, and disability etiquette.
6. Community Engagement: Engage with the local Arabic-speaking community through outreach and partnership initiatives. Listen to their needs and concerns, and work collaboratively to create public spaces that are responsive to their needs.

This can include providing translation services for important documents, offering language classes or cultural programs, and providing access to halal food options.
8. Respectful Communication: Communicate with Arabic speakers in
