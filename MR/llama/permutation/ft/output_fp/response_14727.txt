Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants to the US can be crucial for their well-being and successful integration into society. Here are some ways to help independent individuals:

1. Language classes: Offer language classes or connect them with local organizations that provide language instruction, such as community colleges, libraries, or non-profits. This will help them improve their English skills and communicate more effectively in their daily lives.
2. Cultural orientation programs: Organize cultural orientation programs to introduce new immigrants to the local customs, laws, and social norms of the US. These programs can help them understand how things work in America and navigate everyday situations more easily.
3. Social events: Host social events or potlucks that bring together recent immigrants with long-time residents. This can help build relationships and foster a sense of community, which is essential for social inclusion.
4. Job training and placement: Provide job training and placement services to help immigrants find employment opportunities that match their skills and experience. This can help them become financially independent and feel more integrated into the local economy.
5. Legal aid and support: Connect recent immigrants with organizations that provide free or low-cost legal services, such as immigration law clinics or non-profit organizations that specialize in immigration issues. This can help them navigate the complex US immigration system and access the resources they need to live and work legally in the country.
6. Children's programs: Offer programs for children of recent immigrants, such as after-school tutoring or summer camps, to help them adjust to their new environment and build friendships with local kids. This can also help reduce cultural and linguistic barriers between immigrant and native-born families.
7. Community gardening: Encourage recent immigrants to participate in community gardening initiatives, which can provide a space for socializing, sharing cultures, and building relationships with neighbors. This can also help them access fresh produce and build connections with the local food system.
8. Art and cultural programs: Support arts and cultural programs that celebrate diversity and promote intercultural understanding. This can include exhibitions, performances, or workshops that showcase immigrant cultures and traditions.
