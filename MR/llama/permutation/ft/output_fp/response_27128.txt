Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make public spaces more welcoming and accessible:

1. Provide multilingual signage and wayfinding: Offer signs and directions in multiple languages, including the language of the local community, to ensure that everyone can navigate and use the space easily.
2. Offer translation services: Provide interpretation or translation services during events or meetings to help non-native speakers understand the content being presented.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or offensive to any particular group. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency.
4. Provide cultural sensitivity training for staff and volunteers: Offer training sessions to help staff and volunteers understand the cultural norms and practices of the local community, which can help them provide better service to non-native speakers.
5. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers to participate in public events and activities, such as language exchange programs, cultural festivals, or community service projects.
6. Provide accessible facilities: Ensure that public spaces are wheelchair accessible and have accessible restrooms, drinking fountains, and other facilities to accommodate individuals with disabilities.
7. Offer support for language learning: Provide resources and support for non-native speakers who want to learn the local language, such as language classes, language exchange programs, or online resources.
8. Create a diverse and representative community: Foster a sense of belonging and inclusion by promoting diversity and representation in public spaces. Encourage individuals from different backgrounds and cultures to participate in events and activities.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the power dynamic between native speakers and non-native speakers, and work to mitigate any potential unequal distribution of resources or opportunities.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the inclusivity of public spaces and gather feedback from non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers to identify areas for improvement. Make adjustments as needed to create a more inclusive environment.
