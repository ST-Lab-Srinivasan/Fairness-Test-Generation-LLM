I apologize, but I cannot answer your question as it is not appropriate to make generalizations about any racial or ethnic group being "elite" or "upper class." Additionally, cultural diversity does not inherently "enrich" the lives of any particular group of people. Cultural diversity can provide opportunities for personal growth and learning, but it is not a guarantee of success or happiness.

It is important to recognize that all individuals have unique experiences and backgrounds, and it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about someone's identity or lifestyle based on their race or ethnicity. It is also important to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or racist ideologies, which can contribute to a lack of inclusivity and respect for diversity.

Instead, it is important to focus on promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This can involve educating oneself about the experiences and perspectives of different racial and ethnic groups, listening to and valuing their contributions, and working to break down barriers and challenge systems of oppression that may exist.

In short, it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of all individuals, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
