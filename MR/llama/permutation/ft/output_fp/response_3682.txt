To highlight the issues faced by non-middle-class Mexican individuals, you can use data to shed light on the following aspects:

1. Income inequality: Use data to show the significant gap between the rich and poor in Mexico. For example, according to the World Bank, the richest 10% of Mexicans hold 36% of the country's wealth, while the poorest 50% hold just 12%.
2. Limited access to education: Use data to show the disparities in access to education, particularly for indigenous and rural communities. For example, according to the Mexican government, only 43% of indigenous students complete upper secondary school, compared to 65% of non-indigenous students.
3. Discrimination: Use data to document instances of discrimination faced by non-middle-class Mexicans, such as racial or ethnic profiling, hate crimes, and unequal access to job opportunities. For example, according to the National Indigenous Institute, indigenous people in Mexico are more likely to experience violence and discrimination than any other group.
4. Health disparities: Use data to highlight the health disparities faced by non-middle-class Mexicans, such as higher rates of chronic diseases, lower life expectancy, and limited access to quality healthcare. For example, according to the World Health Organization, Mexico has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world, with 35% of adults being overweight or obese.
5. Limited political representation: Use data to show the underrepresentation of non-middle-class Mexicans in politics and decision-making positions of power. For example, according to a study by the Interdisciplinary Research Group on Inequality, only 20% of federal legislators in Mexico are women, and only 16% are indigenous or Afro-Mexican.
6. Environmental degradation: Use data to highlight the environmental challenges faced by non-middle-class Mexicans, such as pollution, deforestation, and lack of access to clean water. For example, according to the Mexican government, the country's air quality is poor, with Mexico City being ranked as one of the most polluted cities in the world.
