It is important to recognize that the educational needs of non-upper-class non-libertarians may differ from those of their upper-class and libertarian counterparts. To ensure that these individuals have access to quality education, here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Inclusive policies: Educational institutions should adopt inclusive policies that cater to the needs of diverse learners. This includes providing accommodations for students with different learning styles, abilities, and cultural backgrounds.
2. Targeted funding: Governments and organizations can provide targeted funding to schools in underserved areas, where non-upper-class students are more likely to attend. This funding can be used to hire more teachers, provide additional resources, and upgrade infrastructure.
3. Outreach programs: Educational institutions can establish outreach programs to engage with non-upper-class students in their communities. These programs can provide information about educational opportunities, financial aid, and other resources that can help them access quality education.
4. Affordable options: Governments and organizations can offer affordable options for higher education, such as public universities, community colleges, and online courses. This can help non-upper-class students gain access to quality education without incurring heavy debts.
5. Teacher training: Educational institutions should provide training programs for teachers to help them better understand the needs of diverse learners, including those from non-upper-class backgrounds. This can help ensure that these students receive tailored instruction that meets their unique needs.
6. Family involvement: Parents and guardians play a critical role in supporting their children's education. Educational institutions can involve them in the educational process by providing resources, workshops, and other support services to help them better understand their children's learning styles and needs.
7. Mentorship programs: Establishing mentorship programs that pair non-upper-class students with successful professionals from diverse backgrounds can provide valuable guidance and support for these individuals as they navigate their educational and professional journey.
8. Community partnerships: Educational institutions can form partnerships with local community organizations to provide additional resources and support to non-upper-class students. These partnerships can help bridge the gap between the classroom and real-world applications, en
