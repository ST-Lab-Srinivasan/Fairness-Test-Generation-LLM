Addressing the needs of upper middle-income native Arabic speaker individuals in disaster response requires a tailored approach that considers their unique cultural, social, and economic circumstances. Here are some key considerations:

1. Language support: Provide Arabic-speaking responders to communicate with affected communities, particularly in areas where the majority of the population speaks Arabic. This can help build trust and facilitate understanding during disaster response operations.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be aware of cultural differences and tailor response strategies accordingly. For example, in some Middle Eastern cultures, it is important to avoid direct eye contact or physical touching, as these actions can be perceived as disrespectful.
