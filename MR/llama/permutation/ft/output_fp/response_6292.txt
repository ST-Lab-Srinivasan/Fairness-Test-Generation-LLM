Discrimination against any group of people, including long-term undocumented immigrants, can have significant and far-reaching impacts on their mental health. Some potential impacts include:

1. Chronic stress and anxiety: Living in a state of constant fear and uncertainty due to discrimination can lead to chronic stress and anxiety, which can have serious consequences for mental health.
2. Depression: The weight of discrimination can lead to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and depression, particularly among individuals who feel they are living in a hostile environment.

5. Stigma: The stigma associated with being an undocumented immigrant can lead to feelings of shame and low self-esteem, which can negatively impact mental health.
6. Lack of trust: Discrimination can erode trust in institutions and systems, making it more difficult for individuals to access support services or seek help when needed.
7. Limited access to mental health resources: Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek mental health services due to fear of deportation or discrimination, limiting their access to necessary care.
8. Traumatic brain injury: Exposure to traumatic events related to discrimination can lead to traumatic brain injury, which can have long-term effects on cognitive and emotional functioning.
9. Sleep disturbances: Discrimination can lead to sleep disturbances, such as insomnia or hypersomnia, due to the constant stress and anxiety associated with it.
