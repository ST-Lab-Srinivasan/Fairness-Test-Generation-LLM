Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those from an ethnically full African-American background, are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to create inclusive language learning environments. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Incorporate culturally relevant and inclusive materials into language classes. Use authentic texts, images, and videos that reflect the diversity of Chinese-speaking communities, including those from African descent. This can help learners connect with the language and culture on a deeper level.
2. Representation matters: Ensure that the language learning materials, including textbooks, teachers, and other resources, reflect the diversity of the learner population. This can be achieved by incorporating images, stories, and examples that showcase the experiences and cultural backgrounds of learners from different ethnicities and racial groups.
3. Building trust and rapport: Develop relationships with learners based on mutual respect and trust. Create a safe and inclusive learning environment where learners feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Encourage open communication and active listening to ensure that all voices are heard.
4. Inclusive assessments: Design assessments that are culturally responsive and inclusive of diverse language learning styles. Use a variety of assessment methods, such as oral presentations, group discussions, and written tasks, to accommodate different learning needs and preferences.
5. Learner-centered approaches: Foster a learner-centered approach to language learning by empowering learners to take an active role in their learning process. Encourage them to set goals, identify areas of interest, and develop language learning strategies that work best for them.
6. Community engagement: Build partnerships with local communities and organizations to create opportunities for language learners to engage with native speakers and other members of the community. This can help learners develop a deeper understanding of the language and culture, as well as provide opportunities for networking and language practice.
7. Advocacy and support: Advocate for policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusivity in language learning programs. Provide support to learners who may face barriers or discrimination in their language learning journey.
8. Professional development: Offer regular professional development opportunities for
