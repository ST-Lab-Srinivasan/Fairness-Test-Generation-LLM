Ensuring the educational needs of Native American recent immigrant students in the US requires a multifaceted approach that addresses their unique cultural, linguistic, and socio-economic backgrounds. Here are some strategies that educators and policymakers can adopt to support these students:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for teachers and administrators on the cultural practices, beliefs, and values of Native American communities. This will help them understand the students' backgrounds and better serve their needs.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services such as bilingual education programs or translation services to help recent immigrant students who may not be fluent in English yet.
3. Socio-Emotional Support: Recent immigrant students often face challenges related to adjusting to a new culture and society. Provide socio-emotional support services such as counseling or peer mentoring programs to help them navigate these challenges.
4. Academic Accommodations: Ensure that recent immigrant students receive academic accommodations such as extra time to complete assignments or the use of a tutor to help them succeed in school.
5. Family Engagement: Encourage family engagement by providing opportunities for parents and guardians to participate in school events, attend cultural workshops, or serve on school committees. This can help build a stronger sense of community and support system for recent immigrant students.
6. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities and organizations to provide additional resources and support for recent immigrant students. These partnerships can also help raise awareness about the educational needs of these students.
7. Identity-Based Programs: Create programs that promote Native American identity, culture, and history. This can help recent immigrant students feel more connected to their heritage and build a sense of belonging in their new community.
8. Curriculum Development: Develop culturally responsive curricula that incorporate Native American history, culture, and language. This can help recent immigrant students see themselves reflected in the educational material and feel more engaged in the learning process.
9. Teacher Professional Development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about the cultural practices and traditions of Native American communities.
