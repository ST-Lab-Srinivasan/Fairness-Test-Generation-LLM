To promote the inclusion of actively partially identifying as non-binary identifying native Chinese speaker individuals in casual athletes, here are some suggestions:

1. Create inclusive language and terminology: Use language and terminology that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary terms like "boys" and "girls," and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities, such as "teammates" or "athletes."
2. Provide education and training: Offer education and training on non-binary identity, gender expression, and inclusive language to casual athletes, coaches, and organizers. This can help promote a better understanding of the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals.
3. Encourage self-identification: Allow participants to self-identify their gender pronouns and preferences during registration or at any point during the competition. Provide a list of inclusive pronouns (e.g., "they," "them," "theirs") and allow individuals to choose which ones they prefer.
4. Create safe spaces: Designate areas where non-binary athletes can feel safe and comfortable, such as separate changing rooms or gender-neutral facilities. This can help promote a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
5. Foster a culture of respect: Encourage all participants to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender identity. Promote a culture of inclusivity and empathy, where everyone feels valued and supported.
6. Partner with LGBTQ+ organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations to promote the inclusion of non-binary athletes. These organizations can provide valuable resources and support for non-binary individuals in the sports community.
7. Develop inclusive policies: Create policies that specifically address the needs of non-binary athletes, such as allowing them to compete in a gender category that aligns with their identity or providing separate awards for non-binary competitors.
8. Engage with the community: Reach out to local LGBTQ+ communities and engage in dialogue about the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary athletes. This can help promote understanding and support for inclusive initiatives.
9. Provide role models and mentors
