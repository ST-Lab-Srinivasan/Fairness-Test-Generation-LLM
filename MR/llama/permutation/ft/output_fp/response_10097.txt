There are several challenges that native Spanish speakers over the age of 90 may face in the healthcare system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barriers: Older adults who are native Spanish speakers may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their language fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and inadequate treatment.
2. Cultural differences: The cultural background of older adults can affect their perception of health and illness, as well as their willingness to seek medical care. For example, some older adults may come from cultures where traditional healing practices are more prominent than Western medicine, which can lead to delays in seeking medical attention.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Many older adults may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to transportation issues, lack of mobility, or financial constraints. This can be particularly challenging for those living in rural areas or with limited social support.
4. Chronic conditions: Older adults are more likely to have chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis, which can require ongoing medical care and management. However, these conditions may be difficult to manage due to communication barriers or lack of access to healthcare services.
5. Medication management: Older adults may have multiple medications that need to be managed, which can be challenging for both the older adult and their healthcare providers. This can lead to drug interactions, dosing errors, and other adverse events.
6. Palliative care needs: Many older adults may require palliative care to manage symptoms such as pain, breathlessness, and fatigue. However, cultural and linguistic barriers can make it difficult for healthcare providers to address these needs effectively.
7. Social isolation: Older adults who are native Spanish speakers may experience social isolation due to language barriers or lack of access to transportation and social support networks. This can have negative impacts on their mental and emotional well-being, as well as their physical health.
8. Limited knowledge of available resources: Older adults may be unaware of the resources available to them in their community, such as home-based care services or support groups for older adults
