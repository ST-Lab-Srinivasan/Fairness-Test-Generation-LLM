As a beginning English speaker and soft libertarian, cultural heritage plays a significant role in my life. Here are some ways in which it impacts me:

1. Identity formation: As a soft libertarian, I believe in the importance of individual freedom and autonomy. However, I also recognize that culture plays a significant role in shaping our identities and beliefs. My cultural heritage, including my upbringing and exposure to various cultures, has influenced my political views and personal values.
2. Cultural exchange: As a beginner English speaker, I am constantly engaging in cultural exchange with people from different backgrounds. This exchange helps me learn about new cultures and traditions, which broaden my perspectives and challenge my assumptions. Through these interactions, I gain a deeper understanding of the diversity of human experiences and the importance of respecting and appreciating cultural differences.
3. Personal growth: My cultural heritage has taught me valuable lessons about resilience, adaptability, and self-reflection. For example, my family's immigrant experience has instilled in me a strong work ethic and a willingness to overcome obstacles. These traits have helped me navigate the challenges of learning a new language and adapting to a new cultural context.
4. Cultural preservation: As a soft libertarian, I believe in the importance of preserving cultural heritage while also promoting social justice. This means recognizing the historical power dynamics that have marginalized certain cultures and actively working to redress these imbalances. By engaging in dialogue and collaboration with people from diverse backgrounds, I can help ensure that cultural traditions are respected and valued.
5. Intersectionality: As a beginner English speaker, I recognize that my cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of my identity, such as race, gender, and sexuality. This intersectionality informs my political views and personal values, and I strive to be mindful of how these intersections impact my interactions with others. By engaging in inclusive and respectful dialogue, I can help create a more equitable and just society.
6. Community building: My cultural heritage has taught me the value of community and belonging. As a soft libertarian, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to form communities based on shared values and interests. By eng
