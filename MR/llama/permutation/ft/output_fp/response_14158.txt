Supporting the social inclusion of Nigerian long-time married people can be achieved through various strategies. Here are some ways to promote their social integration and well-being:

1. Organize community events: Host community events, such as picnics, potlucks, or cultural festivals, where long-time married couples can mingle with other married couples and build relationships.
2. Create support groups: Form support groups specifically for long-time married couples, where they can share their experiences, challenges, and successes. These groups can provide a safe space for them to connect with others who understand their situation.
3. Offer counseling services: Provide counseling services tailored to the needs of long-time married couples. This can help them address any issues that may have arisen in their marriage, such as communication problems or financial stress.
4. Promote intergenerational connections: Encourage long-time married couples to connect with younger generations through mentorship programs or social events. This can help bridge the generation gap and create a sense of community among all ages.
5. Provide educational resources: Offer workshops, seminars, or online courses that provide practical skills and knowledge to long-time married couples. Topics could include financial planning, conflict resolution, and relationship building.
6. Facilitate social activities: Organize social activities such as game nights, book clubs, or volunteer opportunities. These events can help long-time married couples build relationships with other married couples and engage in meaningful activities together.
7. Create a mentorship program: Pair long-time married couples with younger married couples who could benefit from their experience and wisdom. This can provide an opportunity for the older couples to pass on their knowledge and skills to the next generation.
8. Develop a peer support network: Establish a network of peers who are going through similar experiences, such as managing long-term relationships or navigating retirement. This can provide a sense of connection and support among long-time married couples.
9. Offer cultural events: Host cultural events that celebrate the rich heritage and traditions of Nigerian culture. These events can help foster a sense of community and belonging among long-time married couples.
