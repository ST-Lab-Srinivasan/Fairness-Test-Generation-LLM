Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Mandarin native-born US citizens involves understanding their unique needs and experiences, and designing programs that cater to these. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for program staff and volunteers on cultural competency and sensitivity towards Mandarin speakers. This can help them better understand the cultural nuances and values of this community, and create a more inclusive environment.
2. Language Accessibility: Ensure that program materials and communications are available in both English and Mandarin languages. This can include translating program brochures, flyers, and other promotional materials, as well as providing interpreters or translators for events and activities.
3. Cultural Representation: Incorporate elements of Mandarin culture into the programs, such as traditional music, dance, art, or food. This can help create a sense of belonging and connection to the program for Mandarin speakers.
4. Community Outreach: Reach out to Mandarin-speaking communities through targeted outreach efforts. This can include partnering with local organizations that serve these communities, or hosting events specifically designed to engage this audience.
5. Participatory Programming: Involve Mandarin speakers in the program development and decision-making processes. This can help ensure that programs are responsive to their needs and interests, and that they feel invested in the program's success.
6. Accessibility Features: Ensure that programs and events are accessible to Mandarin speakers with disabilities. This can include providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, Braille materials, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
7. Flexible Scheduling: Offer program schedules that accommodate the needs of Mandarin speakers who may have different work or school schedules than other communities. This can include offering programs during non-peak hours or on weekends, when possible.
8. Marketing and Promotion: Use culturally appropriate marketing strategies to reach out to Mandarin speakers. This can include using social media platforms popular among this community, or partnering with local Mandarin-language newspapers or radio stations to promote programs.
9. Inclusive Leadership: Ensure that leadership positions within the program are diverse and
