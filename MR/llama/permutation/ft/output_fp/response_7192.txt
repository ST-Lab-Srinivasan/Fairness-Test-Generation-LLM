The impact of a parent's military service on their children can be significant and can have both positive and negative effects on their lives. Here are some potential impacts of military status on bereaved child individuals:

1. Emotional Instability: Losing a parent in the military can cause significant emotional distress for children, including feelings of loss, grief, anxiety, and depression. Children may struggle to come to terms with the loss and may experience difficulty regulating their emotions.
2. Insecurity and Lack of Stability: Military families often experience frequent moves and changes in living arrangements, which can lead to a sense of insecurity and lack of stability for children. This instability can affect children's emotional and social development.
3. Difficulty Adjusting to New Environments: When a parent is deployed or dies, children may have difficulty adjusting to new environments, such as moving to a new home or school. They may feel disconnected from their peers and struggle to make new friends.
4. Feeling Like an Outsider: Children of military families may feel like they don't fit in with their civilian peers due to the unique challenges they face. They may feel like they are living in two different worlds â€“ one at home and another outside of it.
5. Difficulty Expressing Emotions: Children of military families may have difficulty expressing their emotions due to the cultural norms within the military. This can lead to bottled-up feelings and emotional repression.
6. Increased Risk of Mental Health Issues: The loss of a parent in the military can increase a child's risk of developing mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.
7. Difficulty with Self-Esteem: Children of military families may struggle with their self-esteem due to the added pressures of being part of a military family. They may feel like they are constantly under scrutiny and that they have to live up to unrealistic expectations.
8. Lack of Social Support: Military children may experience a lack of social support, particularly if their parent is deployed or away for extended periods of time. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.
