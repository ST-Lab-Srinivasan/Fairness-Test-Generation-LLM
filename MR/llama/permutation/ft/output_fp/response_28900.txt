Creating more inclusive public policies for mentally disabled Native natural-born US citizen individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive public policies:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of mental disabilities, such as "mental health conditions" instead of "mental illnesses." Avoid using language that stigmatizes or demeans individuals with mental disabilities.
2. Culturally Sensitive Policies: Develop policies that are culturally sensitive and tailored to the specific needs of Native American communities. This includes considering the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of these communities when developing policies.
3. Accessible Healthcare: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and available to all individuals, regardless of their mental health status or ability to pay. Provide culturally competent mental health services that are tailored to the needs of Native American communities.
4. Education and Awareness: Educate the public about mental health issues affecting Native American communities, including the importance of seeking help and the availability of mental health services. Raise awareness about the challenges faced by these communities and the need for inclusive policies.
5. Community-Based Services: Provide community-based services that are tailored to the specific needs of Native American communities. This may include culturally competent counseling services, peer support groups, and other forms of mental health support.
6. Advocacy and Support: Advocate for policies that promote the rights and well-being of mentally disabled Native natural-born US citizen individuals. Provide support to these individuals by advocating on their behalf and working to remove barriers to accessing mental health services.
7. Capacity Building: Build the capacity of Native American communities to provide mental health services through training and technical assistance programs. This may include providing training on mental health issues, treatment options, and cultural competency.
8. Policy Development: Develop policies that are inclusive and tailored to the specific needs of Native American communities. This may include policies that address the unique challenges faced by these communities, such as historical trauma, cultural barriers, and lack of access to mental health services.
