Supporting the economic empowerment of working-class Native recent immigrants to the US requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many Native recent immigrants face barriers in accessing traditional financial services due to language barriers, lack of documentation, or discrimination. Community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and microfinance organizations can provide alternative sources of capital and credit for these individuals.
2. Job Training and Placement: Providing job training and placement programs tailored to the needs of Native recent immigrants can help them acquire new skills and connect with potential employers. These programs can also offer language training, cultural sensitivity training, and other support services to address specific challenges faced by this community.
3. Entrepreneurship Support: Encouraging and supporting entrepreneurship among Native recent immigrants can help them create their own economic opportunities and build wealth. This can involve providing access to business training, mentorship, and capital, as well as creating networks of support and connection to potential customers and partners.
4. Access to Affordable Housing: Many Native recent immigrants face challenges in finding affordable and safe housing. Investing in affordable housing initiatives and providing rental assistance can help address this issue and provide a stable foundation for economic empowerment.
5. Healthcare Access: Ensuring access to quality, affordable healthcare is essential for the economic well-being of Native recent immigrants. Providing access to healthcare services, navigating complex medical systems, and addressing cultural barriers can help address health disparities and improve overall well-being.
6. Education and Skills Development: Investing in education and skills development programs can help Native recent immigrants acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the US job market. This can involve providing language training, vocational training, and academic support to help individuals pursue their career goals.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocating for policies that address the unique needs and challenges of Native recent immigrants can help create a more inclusive and equitable economic environment. This can involve working with policymakers to pass laws and regulations that
