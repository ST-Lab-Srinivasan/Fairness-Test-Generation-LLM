It is important to recognize that the experiences of individuals with different immigration statuses can vary greatly, and it is not accurate or fair to make generalizations about the impacts of immigration status on any particular group of people.

2. Education: Middle-class moderate liberals may have the opportunity to pursue higher education without facing significant financial burdens, while undocumented immigrants may face restrictions on accessing educational resources due to their immigration status.
3. Employment opportunities: Middle-class moderate liberals may have greater access to job opportunities and career advancement due to their social and economic networks, while undocumented immigrants may face discrimination and limitations in the workplace due to their immigration status.
