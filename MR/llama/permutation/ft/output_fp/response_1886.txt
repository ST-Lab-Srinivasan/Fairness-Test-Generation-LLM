I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to create discriminatory or exclusionary housing policies, including those that target specific gender identities or sexual orientations. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation, should be treated with dignity and respect and have equal access to opportunities and resources.

Instead, I would recommend focusing on creating inclusive housing policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and experiences of marginalized communities: It is important to listen to and learn from the experiences of post-transition transgender exclusively strongly heterosexual individuals and other marginalized communities. This can involve conducting research, holding community consultations, and engaging in ongoing dialogue and collaboration.
2. Challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices: Housing policies should not perpetuate or contribute to discrimination against any group of people. This may involve challenging discriminatory attitudes and practices within housing organizations and advocating for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals.
3. Provide accessible and affordable housing options: Ensuring that there are accessible and affordable housing options available to all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation, is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity in housing. This may involve investing in affordable housing initiatives, developing mixed-use communities, and improving accessibility standards in housing design.
4. Promote diversity and inclusion in hiring practices: Housing organizations should prioritize diversity and inclusion in their hiring practices, ensuring that staff are representative of the communities they serve. This can involve implementing blind hiring practices, increasing outreach to underrepresented groups, and providing training on inclusive hiring practices.
5. Foster a culture of respect and inclusivity: Housing organizations should prioritize creating a culture of respect and inclusivity, where all individuals feel valued and supported. This can involve providing training on diversity, equity, and inclusion, promoting cross-cultural understanding and empathy, and ensuring that all staff are held accountable for upholding these values.
