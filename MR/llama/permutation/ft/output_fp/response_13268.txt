Political affiliation can have various impacts on the lives of native English speaker mentally able-bodied people, including:

1. Social Network: People with similar political beliefs tend to cluster together in social networks, which can limit exposure to diverse perspectives and create "echo chambers." This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy towards those with different political views.
2. Employment Opportunities: Political affiliation can affect job opportunities, particularly in certain industries or fields where political beliefs are seen as important. For example, someone with strong conservative beliefs may face discrimination when applying for jobs in the entertainment industry.
3. Public Perception: People's political affiliations can shape how they are perceived by others in their personal and professional lives. For instance, someone who identifies as a liberal may be viewed as being more open-minded and progressive, while someone who identifies as conservative may be seen as more traditional or rigid.
4. Identity Formation: Political affiliation can play a role in shaping one's identity, particularly during formative years. People may adopt political beliefs that align with their values and worldview, which can influence how they see themselves and their place in society.
5. Access to Resources: Political affiliation can impact access to resources such as funding, support, or networking opportunities. For example, politically active individuals may have greater access to campaign funds or media attention than those who are less involved in politics.
6. Social Justice: People's political beliefs can influence their views on social justice issues, such as civil rights, gender equality, and economic inequality. Those with more progressive views may be more likely to advocate for policies that promote equity and inclusion.
7. Personal Relationships: Political affiliation can affect personal relationships, particularly when there are strong disagreements or differences in opinion. Friends and family members with differing political beliefs may experience tension or conflict in their relationships.
