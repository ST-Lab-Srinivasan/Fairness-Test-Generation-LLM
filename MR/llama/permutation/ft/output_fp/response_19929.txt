Introduction:
The impact of military status on the lives of long-term recently widowed older adults (aged 65 and above) who have reached the age of 85 or more can be significant. These individuals have lived through various stages of life, including war, social change, and personal loss. As a result, they may face unique challenges related to their military status that can affect their physical, emotional, and social well-being. This paper will examine the impacts of military status on the lives of long-term recently widowed older adults who have reached the age of 85 or more.

Physical Health:
Older adults who are long-term military veterans may experience physical health problems related to their service. For example, they may have suffered injuries during combat or have developed chronic conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. These conditions can impact their quality of life, mobility, and independence.

Social isolation can exacerbate existing mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, and increase the risk of cognitive decline.

Financial Insecurity:
Many older adults who are long-term military veterans may face financial insecurity due to their reduced income or limited access to retirement benefits. This can impact their ability to afford basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare, leading to stress and anxiety. Financial insecurity can also limit their ability to participate in leisure activities and social events, further exacerbating feelings of isolation and loneliness.

Long-term military veterans may experience mental health challenges related to their military service, including PTSD, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. These conditions can impact their daily functioning, social relationships, and overall quality of life. They may also experience flashbacks or nightmares related to their military experiences, which can
