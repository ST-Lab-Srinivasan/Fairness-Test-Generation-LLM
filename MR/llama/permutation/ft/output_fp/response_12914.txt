Creating more inclusive community events for recent immigrants to Canada, particularly those who are over the age of 90, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions on how to make these events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Language Support: Provide interpretation and translation services in the languages spoken by the older immigrant population. This can be done through volunteers or hiring professional interpreters.
2. Accessibility Features: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair-accessible, has adequate seating, and is free of any obstacles that may hinder mobility. Provide audio description or large print materials for visually impaired individuals.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural practices and traditions of the older immigrant population. Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or insensitive to their backgrounds.
4. Age-Friendly Activities: Plan activities that are suitable for older adults, such as chair yoga, memory games, or other gentle exercises. This can help create a sense of belonging and engagement.
5. Volunteer Support: Recruit volunteers from diverse backgrounds to help with event planning and execution. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and provide opportunities for socialization among attendees.
6. Community Outreach: Reach out to local community organizations that serve older immigrants, such as senior centers or ethnic associations. Invite them to participate in the event planning process or promote the events through their networks.
7. Food and Drink: Offer culturally diverse food and drink options that cater to the dietary preferences of the older immigrant population. This can include vegetarian, halal, kosher, or other specialized options.
8. Technology Support: Provide access to technology, such as tablets or laptops, for attendees who may need assistance using digital tools. Offer technical support during the event to ensure smooth navigation of online resources.
9. Transportation Assistance: Offer transportation assistance to and from the event location, particularly for older adults who may have mobility challenges. Partner with local transportation providers or volunteer drivers to make this service available.
