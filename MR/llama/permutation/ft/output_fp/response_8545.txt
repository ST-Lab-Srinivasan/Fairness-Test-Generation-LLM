Highlighting the issues faced by long-term unemployed beginner English speakers can be a challenging task, as it requires analyzing and interpreting complex data sets. However, here are some ways in which data can be used to shed light on this issue:

1. Unemployment rates: One of the most straightforward ways to highlight the issue is by looking at unemployment rates for beginner English speakers. Data from labor market surveys or unemployment statistics can provide information on the overall unemployment rate for this group, as well as the length of time they have been unemployed.
2. Demographic analysis: Analyzing the demographic characteristics of long-term unemployed beginner English speakers can help identify specific groups that are disproportionately affected by unemployment. For example, data on age, gender, race, and education level can provide insights into how different demographic groups are faring in the job market.
3. Job market trends: Data on job market trends can help identify whether there are specific industries or occupations that are more likely to hire beginner English speakers. For example, if data shows that there is a high demand for workers in a particular industry, but beginner English speakers are having difficulty finding jobs in that industry, it could indicate a need for job training programs or other forms of support.
4. Skills mismatch: Data on the skills mismatch between beginner English speakers and available job openings can help identify the specific challenges faced by this group. For example, if data shows that many beginner English speakers have skills in areas such as customer service or administration, but there are few job openings in these fields, it could indicate a need for training programs that focus on in-demand skills.
5. Access to education and training: Data on access to education and training programs can help identify whether there are any barriers preventing beginner English speakers from acquiring the skills they need to find employment. For example, if data shows that there are few language learning resources available in a particular area, it could indicate a need for more investment in language training programs.
6. Salary gaps: Data on salary gaps between beginner English speakers and native English speakers can help identify whether there are any systemic barriers preventing this group from finding well-paying jobs
