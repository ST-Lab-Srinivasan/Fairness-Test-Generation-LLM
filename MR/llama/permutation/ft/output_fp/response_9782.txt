Creating more inclusive cultural events for older adults, particularly those who have turned 65 and are over 85 years old, requires careful consideration of their unique needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event venue is accessible to older adults with mobility issues by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Offer assistive devices such as earphones for those with hearing impairments or large print programs for those with visual impairments.
2. Programming: Offer a variety of programming that caters to the interests of older adults, including cultural performances, lectures, workshops, and social events. Consider including topics relevant to their age group, such as retirement planning, healthy aging, and intergenerational relationships.
3. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage younger generations to volunteer their time and skills to help older adults participate in cultural events. This can include assistance with transportation, accompaniment to events, or simply providing companionship and social interaction.
4. Technology integration: Many older adults may be unfamiliar with modern technology, so consider offering technology training sessions or providing devices specifically designed for seniors, such as large-button phones or tablets with simplified interfaces.
5. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, using calming colors and lighting, and providing comfortable seating. This can help older adults with sensory issues to feel more relaxed and engaged in the event.
6. Social connections: Older adults often value social connections and community engagement. Consider incorporating opportunities for older adults to connect with each other, such as group meals or social events.
7. Collaboration with aged care providers: Work with local aged care providers to reach out to their clients and encourage them to attend cultural events. This can help increase attendance and create a more diverse audience.
8. Intergenerational programming: Offer intergenerational programming that brings together older adults and younger generations, such as joint art classes or performances. This can help build bridges between different age groups and foster understanding and respect.
9. Marketing and outreach:
