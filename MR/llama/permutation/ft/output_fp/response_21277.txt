As a beginner French speaker who has been widowed for a long time, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties that you may encounter:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges for beginner French speakers is the language barrier. While French is the official language of Quebec, English is also widely spoken, and many jobs require proficiency in both languages. As a beginner French speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in job interviews or work-related situations.
2. Lack of Experience: If you have been out of the workforce for an extended period due to your spouse's passing, you may lack experience in the job market. This can make it difficult to compete with other candidates who have more recent work experience.
3. Aging Workforce: As a widowed person older than 50, you may face ageism in the job market. Some employers may be hesitant to hire older workers, especially if they are seeking a younger workforce.
4. Different Expectations: As a beginner French speaker, you may have different expectations about what constitutes a fulfilling career.
