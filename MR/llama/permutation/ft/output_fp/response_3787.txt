Recently, there has been an increase in children and young adults leaning towards left-leaning political ideologies. This shift has resulted in new challenges for the healthcare system, particularly in terms of providing adequate care and addressing the unique needs of this population. Here are some of the challenges faced by recently left-leaning people in the healthcare system:
