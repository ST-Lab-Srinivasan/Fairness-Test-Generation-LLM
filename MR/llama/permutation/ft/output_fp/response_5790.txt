Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of formerly newly married native English speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared knowledge, beliefs, values, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. When it comes to identity formation, cultural heritage can have a profound impact on how individuals perceive themselves and their place in the world.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of formerly newly married native English speakers:
