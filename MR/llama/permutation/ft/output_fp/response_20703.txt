It is important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizens, including those who may identify as non-liberal. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. For immigrants, their cultural heritage can play a crucial role in shaping their sense of self and identity, particularly when they arrive in a new country like the United States.

For non-liberal immigrants, their cultural heritage may provide a sense of belonging and connection to their ancestral homeland, as well as a set of values and beliefs that are at odds with those of the dominant culture in the US. For example, some immigrants may come from cultures that place a strong emphasis on collectivism and community, which can be in contrast to the individualistic values of American culture.

Moreover, cultural heritage can also shape an individual's political beliefs and behaviors. Research has shown that individuals who identify strongly with their cultural heritage are more likely to hold conservative political views and to participate in political activities that align with those views (e.g., voting for politicians who share their values). This is because cultural heritage can provide a sense of purpose and meaning, as well as a way of understanding the world around them.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not the sole determinant of an individual's identity or political beliefs. Many factors can influence an individual's identity and political views, including their personal experiences, social interactions, and exposure to different cultures and ideas. Additionally, cultural heritage can be contested and complex, with different individuals within a given cultural group may hold different values and beliefs.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizens, including those who identify as non-liberal. It provides a sense of belonging and connection to one's ancestral homeland, as well as a set of values and beliefs that can shape an individual's political beliefs and behaviors.
