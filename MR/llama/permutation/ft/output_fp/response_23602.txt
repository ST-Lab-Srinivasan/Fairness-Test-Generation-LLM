Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-long-time married beginner English speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular cultural or ethnic group. For individuals who are newly married or beginning their journey with English, their cultural heritage can influence their identities in several ways:
