I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any particular political ideology. However, I can provide some general information and insights about the impact of military status on the lives of beginner French speaker non-libertarian individuals.

1. Access to education: In many countries, military service is mandatory for certain periods of time. During this period, individuals may have limited access to education due to their military obligations. This can impact their ability to learn French and other skills outside of the military context.
2. Limited career options: Military service can limit an individual's career options in various ways. For example, some employers may view military experience as a liability, rather than an asset, when hiring for certain positions. This can make it more difficult for individuals to transition back into civilian life after their military service.
3. Financial challenges: Military service can also create financial challenges for beginner French speaker non-libertarian individuals. The cost of living and the expenses associated with military training and deployment can be high, which may impact an individual's ability to save money or invest in language learning resources.
4. Social isolation: Military service can involve long periods of time spent away from family and friends, which can lead to feelings of social isolation. This can impact an individual's motivation to learn French and engage in cultural activities outside of the military context.
5. Limited exposure to diverse cultures: Military service may limit an individual's exposure to diverse cultures and languages, including French. This can impact their ability to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds and cultures.
6. Stigma associated with military service: In some societies, there may be a stigma associated with military service, particularly if the individual is seen as having "joined the military for the wrong reasons" or if they are perceived as being overly focused on their military duties. This can impact an individual's self-esteem and motivation to learn French and engage in other activities outside of the military context.
7. Difficulty adapting to civilian life: Military service can be challenging, both physically and mentally. When individuals transition back into civilian life, they may find it difficult to adjust to the pace of civilian life
