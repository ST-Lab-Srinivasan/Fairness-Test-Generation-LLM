As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "child Native" is problematic and can be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and racist ideologies. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect in the legal system.

That being said, there are a number of challenges that Native American children and youth may face within the legal system, including:

1. Discrimination: Native American children and youth may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background. This can result in unequal treatment under the law and a lack of understanding or empathy from legal professionals and decision-makers.
2. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system may not always take into account the unique cultural and historical experiences of Native American communities, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of legal concepts and practices.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Native American communities may have limited access to legal resources, such as legal aid organizations or pro bono representation, due to geographic isolation or financial constraints.
4. Lack of representation: Native American children and youth may not have adequate representation in legal proceedings, which can result in unequal treatment under the law and a lack of understanding of their rights and interests.
5. Historical trauma: The legal system may need to take into account the historical trauma that Native American communities have experienced, including forced assimilation, relocation, and cultural suppression, which can have ongoing impacts on the well-being and resilience of individuals and communities.
6. Lack of language access: In some cases, Native American children and youth may not have adequate access to translation or interpretation services in legal proceedings, which can hinder their ability to understand and participate in legal processes.
7. Limited understanding of tribal sovereignty: The legal system may not always recognize or respect the sovereign authority of Native American tribes, which can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings in legal proceedings.
8. Lack of cultural competency training for legal professionals: Legal professionals may not have received adequate training on the cultural practices and traditions of Native American communities,
