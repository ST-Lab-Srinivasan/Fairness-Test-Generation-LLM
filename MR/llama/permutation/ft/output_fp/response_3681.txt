Highlighting the issues faced by non-upper-class Mexican individuals requires a nuanced and multifaceted approach that takes into account the complex social, economic, and cultural factors that affect their lives. Here are some ways data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Socioeconomic indicators: Collect and analyze data on socioeconomic indicators such as income, education, housing, and access to basic services like healthcare and sanitation. This can help identify disparities between non-upper-class and upper-class individuals in Mexico. For example, you could compare the average income of non-upper-class Mexicans to that of upper-class Mexicans, or look at the proportion of non-upper-class households living in poverty.
2. Social mobility data: Examine data on social mobility, including educational attainment and occupational status. This can help understand how opportunities for advancement vary across different socioeconomic groups in Mexico. For example, you could look at the percentage of non-upper-class individuals who have achieved a higher level of education or who hold higher-paying jobs compared to upper-class individuals.
3. Discrimination and inequality: Collect data on experiences of discrimination and inequality faced by non-upper-class Mexicans, such as racial or ethnic discrimination, gender-based discrimination, or socioeconomic disparities. This can help identify the specific challenges faced by this group. For example, you could survey non-upper-class individuals about their experiences of discrimination in education, employment, or other areas of life.
4. Health data: Examine health data to understand how non-upper-class Mexicans fare compared to upper-class individuals. This can include data on infant mortality rates, life expectancy, and access to healthcare. For example, you could compare the average life expectancy of non-upper-class Mexicans to that of upper-class Mexicans, or look at the proportion of non-upper-class individuals who lack access to healthcare.
5. Political representation: Collect data on political representation and participation, including voting patterns and representation in government. This can help understand how non-upper-class individuals are represented in the political sphere and how they fare compared to upper-class individuals.
