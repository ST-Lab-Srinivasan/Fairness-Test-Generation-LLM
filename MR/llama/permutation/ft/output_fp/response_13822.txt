Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for independent wedded individuals requires understanding and acknowledging the diverse experiences and perspectives of people who identify as single, unmarried, or in non-traditional relationships. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all relationship statuses. Avoid using terms like "husband" or "wife" unless it's relevant to the context. Instead, use phrases like "partner," "significant other," or "beloved."
2. Representation matters: Make sure the cultural celebrations reflect the diversity of relationship statuses. Include representation of single people, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people in non-traditional relationships. This can be done through visuals, performances, or even inviting diverse guests to participate in the celebrations.
3. Flexible seating arrangements: Offer flexible seating arrangements to accommodate different relationship statuses. For example, provide both assigned and unassigned seating options to allow single people to choose how they want to sit during the celebration.
4. Inclusive activities: Plan activities that are inclusive of all relationship statuses. This can include games, performances, or other interactive elements that don't require a specific relationship status.
5. Acknowledge and validate feelings: Recognize that single people may feel left out or excluded during cultural celebrations. Make sure to acknowledge and validate these feelings by providing spaces for them to share their experiences and feelings.
6. Offer support: Provide support and resources for single people who may be struggling with social isolation or other challenges related to being unmarried during cultural celebrations. This can include offering counseling services, support groups, or simply being a listening ear.
7. Create alternative ways to participate: Offer alternative ways for single people to participate in cultural celebrations, such as virtual participation or creating their own cultural events. This can help single people feel included and engaged without feeling left out.
8. Educate others: Educate others about the experiences of single people during cultural celebrations. Share stories, statistics, and research on the challenges faced by unmarried individuals to raise awareness and promote inclusivity.
