Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are moderately proficient. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence their language learning journey:

1. Identity formation: Beginner French speakers may use cultural heritage to form their identity and sense of self. For instance, they may identify with French culture through food, music, art, or literature, and this identification can motivate them to learn the language.
