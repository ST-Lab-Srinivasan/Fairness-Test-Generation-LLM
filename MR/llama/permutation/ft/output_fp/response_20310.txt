That being said, Native American recent immigrants to the US may face unique challenges in the healthcare system due to a variety of factors, including cultural and linguistic barriers, discrimination, and lack of access to resources and services. Here are some potential challenges that they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Native American communities often have their own languages and dialects, which can create communication barriers when interacting with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in these languages.
2. Cultural differences: Native American cultural beliefs and practices may differ significantly from those of the dominant culture, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between patients and healthcare providers.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against Native Americans in the US is still prevalent, and this can manifest in various ways in the healthcare system, including disparities in access to care and unequal treatment by healthcare providers.
4. Limited access to resources: Many Native American communities are located in rural or remote areas, which can make it difficult to access healthcare services, particularly specialized care. Additionally, there may be limited healthcare resources available in these communities due to a lack of investment or infrastructure.
5. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has had a profound impact on the health and well-being of Native American communities. This historical trauma can manifest as chronic stress, substance abuse, and mental health issues, among others.
6. Lack of trust: Due to historical mistreatment and neglect by the healthcare system, some Native Americans may lack trust in healthcare providers and institutions, which can make it difficult for them to seek care or follow treatment recommendations.
7. Limited access to traditional healing practices: Many Native American communities place a strong emphasis on traditional healing practices, such as herbal remedies and spiritual rituals. However, these practices may be difficult to access or incorporate into mainstream
