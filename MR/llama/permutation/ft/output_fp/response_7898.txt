1. Provide multilingual signage and materials: Use both Arabic and English signage in public spaces to make them accessible to both Arabic and non-Arabic speakers. This can include menus, directions, and other important information.
2. Offer language classes or workshops: Host language classes or workshops specifically designed for non-native Arabic speakers. These classes can provide a safe space for learners to practice their skills and receive feedback from instructors.
