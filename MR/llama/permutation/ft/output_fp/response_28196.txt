Supporting the economic empowerment of employed immigrant or recent immigrant individuals in the US requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various challenges they face. Here are some ways to support their economic empowerment:

1. Access to affordable financial services: Many immigrants lack access to affordable financial services such as bank accounts, credit cards, and loans. Non-profit organizations like the National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE) provide resources for immigrants to learn about personal finance and access financial tools.
2. Language barriers: Many immigrants face language barriers that limit their ability to navigate the financial system. Organizations like the New York-based nonprofit, the Financial Clinic, offer bilingual (English and Spanish) financial counseling services to help immigrants overcome language barriers.
3. Lack of credit history: Many immigrants have limited or no credit history in the US, which can make it difficult for them to access credit. Organizations like the San Francisco-based nonprofit, the Asian Law Caucus, provide financial counseling and support to help immigrants build their credit history.

Advocacy groups like the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) work to protect the rights of immigrants and promote policies that reduce discrimination in the financial sector.
5. Access to education and job training: Many immigrants face barriers to accessing education and job training programs due to lack of documentation or other factors. Organizations like the Chicago-based nonprofit, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR), provide training and resources to help immigrants access education and job opportunities.
6. Entrepreneurship support: Many immigrants are entrepreneurs or small business owners, but they face challenges in accessing capital, networks, and other resources. Organizations like the New York-based nonprofit, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), provide legal support and resources to help immigrant entrepreneurs succeed.
