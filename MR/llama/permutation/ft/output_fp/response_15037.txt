I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality. However, I can provide some possible unique perspectives that a long-term undocumented middle-class person might bring to the table:

1. Experience with systems: As an undocumented immigrant, they have likely had to navigate various systems, such as education, healthcare, and legal systems, which can provide valuable insights into how these systems work and how they can be improved.
2. Cross-cultural understanding: Growing up in a different cultural context than their peers, undocumented immigrants may have a unique perspective on the cultural differences and similarities between their home country and the host country. This cross-cultural understanding can help to foster empathy and understanding between different communities.
3. Resilience and adaptability: Undocumented immigrants often face significant challenges and obstacles, such as language barriers, discrimination, and financial insecurity. As a result, they may have developed exceptional resilience and adaptability skills, which can be valuable in any context.
4. Unique perspective on social issues: Undocumented immigrants may have a unique perspective on social issues, such as poverty, inequality, and access to resources. They may be able to provide insights into how these issues affect their community and how they can be addressed.
5. Connection to the community: As an undocumented immigrant, they may have formed close connections with other members of their community, including other immigrants, refugees, and marginalized groups. These connections can provide valuable resources and support networks for addressing social issues.
6. Personal experience with immigration policies: Undocumented immigrants may have personal experience with immigration policies and the impact they have on individuals and families. This experience can provide valuable insights into how immigration policies can be improved to better serve marginalized communities.
7. Unique perspective on education: As an undocumented immigrant, they may have had to navigate different educational systems, such as K-12 schools or higher education institutions. This experience can provide unique insights into how education systems can be improved to better serve marginalized communities.
