Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of partnered beginner Chinese speaker individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society. In the context of language learning, cultural heritage can influence how learners perceive and use the language, as well as their motivation for learning it.

The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities:
Cultural heritage can shape the identities of partnered beginner Chinese speaker individuals in several ways:

This can influence how learners interact with each other and their teacher, as well as their attitudes towards language learning.
2. Customs and Practices: Cultural customs and practices can also shape the identities of partnered learners.
