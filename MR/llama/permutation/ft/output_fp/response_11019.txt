Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner English speakers, especially those from non-English speaking countries. It can influence their language learning journey in several ways:

1. Identity formation: Beginner English speakers may use cultural heritage as a way to establish their identity and sense of belonging in a new language environment. They may draw on their cultural practices, traditions, and values to shape their language learning goals and preferences.

6. Language learning motivation: Knowing their cultural heritage can motivate beginner English speakers to learn the language more enthusiastically. They may be more invested in learning about their culture and expressing themselves in English.
