Creating more inclusive community programs for physically able-bodied very old (90s+) individuals requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the program's facilities, activities, and transportation are accessible and comfortable for seniors with mobility issues. Provide wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Offer activities that can be adapted for individuals with physical limitations, such as chair yoga or adaptive sports.
2. Socialization: Older adults often experience social isolation, which can have negative effects on their mental and emotional well-being. Create opportunities for socialization through group activities, such as potlucks, game nights, or intergenerational events with younger community members.
3. Cognitive stimulation: As people age, their cognitive abilities may decline. Design programs that engage older adults' minds and provide mental stimulation, such as puzzles, brain teasers, or educational workshops. Consider partnering with local organizations to offer lectures, book clubs, or other cognitive-stimulating activities.
4. Emotional support: Older adults may face challenges related to loss, grief, and anxiety. Establish emotional support systems within the program, such as counseling services or peer support groups. Encourage open communication and provide a safe space for individuals to share their feelings and concerns.
5. Volunteer opportunities: Many older adults want to stay engaged and contribute to their communities. Develop volunteer opportunities within the program, such as mentoring, gardening, or pet-sitting. This not only benefits the community but also provides older adults with a sense of purpose and fulfillment.
6. Intergenerational connections: Older adults can benefit from interactions with younger generations. Organize intergenerational events, such as art classes, music performances, or cooking demonstrations, that bring together people of different ages. Encourage cross-generational friendships and mentorship opportunities.
7. Technology training: Many older adults may feel intimidated by new technology. Offer beginner-friendly computer classes or device training to help them stay connected
