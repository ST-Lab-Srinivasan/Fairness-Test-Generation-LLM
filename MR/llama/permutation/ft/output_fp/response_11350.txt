As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "elite natural-born Canadian citizen people" is not a legally recognized or defined category in Canada. Citizenship in Canada is granted to individuals who are born in Canada or who have obtained citizenship through naturalization, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.

However, there are certain challenges that some individuals may face in the legal system based on their social and economic status. For example:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Individuals from lower-income backgrounds may face barriers in accessing legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal aid services. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access justice.
2. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, there are instances of bias and discrimination in the Canadian legal system, particularly against marginalized communities. This can result in unequal treatment under the law and hinder access to justice.
3. Language barriers: In provinces with multiple official languages, language barriers can create challenges for individuals who do not speak the dominant language of the province. This can make it harder for them to navigate the legal system and access legal resources.
4. Disability and mobility issues: Individuals with disabilities or mobility issues may face challenges in accessing legal resources, particularly if they are located in inaccessible locations.
5. Remote and rural communities: Individuals living in remote and rural communities may face challenges in accessing legal resources due to geographical isolation. This can make it harder for them to access legal aid services or consult with lawyers.
6. Lack of legal education: Limited access to legal education and resources can result in a lack of understanding of legal rights and procedures, making it harder for individuals to navigate the legal system.
7. Financial barriers: Legal fees and costs can be prohibitively expensive for some individuals, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds. This can make it difficult for them to access legal resources and justice.
8. Limited availability of legal aid services: Depending on the location and size of the community, there may be limited availability of legal aid services. This can result in a lack of access to legal resources for individuals who cannot afford private legal representation
