To ensure that the educational needs of recently immigrant (1st trimester) Native Spanish speaker students are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Provide interpreter and translator services: Hire interpreters and translators who are fluent in both English and the students' native language to assist in classroom instruction and communication with parents.
2. Offer bilingual or dual-language programs: Implement bilingual or dual-language programs that provide instruction in both English and the students' native language, especially for younger students. This can help them maintain their native language proficiency while also learning English.
3. Use visual aids and hands-on activities: Utilize visual aids and hands-on activities to help students learn new vocabulary and concepts in both languages. This can be particularly helpful for students who are not yet proficient in English.
4. Make use of technology: Leverage technology, such as language learning apps or online resources, to provide additional support outside of the classroom.
5. Foster a supportive school community: Encourage school administrators, teachers, and peers to be welcoming and inclusive of students who are recently immigrated. This can help students feel more comfortable and supported in their new environment.
6. Provide academic accommodations: Work with students to identify any academic accommodations they may need, such as extra time to complete assignments or the use of a separate workspace for taking tests.
7. Offer extracurricular support: Provide opportunities for students to participate in extracurricular activities that promote language development and cultural exchange, such as language clubs or cultural festivals.
8. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that provide language and cultural support services to recently immigrated communities, such as adult education programs or refugee resettlement agencies.
9. Provide mental health support: Recognize the unique challenges that newly immigrated students may face and provide access to mental health resources for students who may be experiencing stress or anxiety related to their transition.
10. Regularly evaluate and adjust strategies: Continuously assess the needs of recently immigrated students and adapt instructional strategies as necessary to ensure that they are receiving the support they need to succeed academically and culturally
