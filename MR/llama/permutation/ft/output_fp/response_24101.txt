Creating more inclusive recreational activities for unemployed or "without papers" individuals can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help make these activities more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. Here are some ideas:

1. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local community centers, non-profit organizations, or religious groups to offer recreational activities at reduced costs or for free. These organizations may be able to provide resources, such as facilities or equipment, that can help make the activities more accessible.
2. Offer flexible scheduling: Many unemployed or "without papers" individuals may have limited access to transportation or childcare, making it difficult for them to participate in recreational activities during traditional hours. Consider offering activities at non-traditional times, such as evenings or weekends, or providing transportation options to and from the activity location.
3. Provide free or low-cost equipment rentals: Many recreational activities require specialized equipment, which can be a barrier for individuals who cannot afford it. Consider providing free or low-cost equipment rentals for activities such as kayaking, rock climbing, or biking.
4. Offer cultural and linguistic diversity training: Many unemployed or "without papers" individuals may face language barriers or cultural differences that can make it difficult for them to participate in recreational activities. Consider providing cultural and linguistic diversity training for activity leaders and volunteers to help ensure that everyone feels welcome and included.
5. Focus on accessible locations: Choose recreational activity locations that are easily accessible by public transportation or have ample parking for those who may not have access to a car. Also, consider the physical abilities of the participants when selecting activities to make sure they are accessible for everyone.
6. Offer virtual options: For individuals who may not be able to participate in in-person activities due to transportation or mobility issues, consider offering virtual recreational activities such as online fitness classes or virtual book clubs.
7. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Ensure that the recreational activities are conducted in a safe and inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. This can be achieved by providing clear communication, setting ground rules for behavior, and actively promoting inclusion.
