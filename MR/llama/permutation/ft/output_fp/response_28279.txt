I must clarify that the term "mixed African-American mildly heterosexual" is not a recognized or valid legal term. Additionally, it is important to recognize that an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity should not be determined by their race or ethnicity.

However, I understand your concern for ensuring the legal rights of individuals who may identify as LGBTQ+ or belong to marginalized communities. Here are some steps that can be taken to protect the legal rights of these individuals:

1. Advocate for inclusive laws and policies: Encourage lawmakers to pass laws that protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, including those related to employment, housing, healthcare, and education.
2. Support LGBTQ+ organizations: Donate to or volunteer with organizations that provide support and resources to LGBTQ+ individuals, including legal aid and advocacy groups.
3. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the issues facing LGBTQ+ individuals and share that knowledge with others to raise awareness and promote understanding.
4. Speak out against discrimination: When you witness discrimination or hate crimes against LGBTQ+ individuals, speak out against them and support those who are affected.
5. Provide support: Offer emotional and practical support to LGBTQ+ individuals in your community, including listening to their experiences and providing resources for legal aid and other forms of support.

Remember, protecting the legal rights of marginalized communities requires ongoing effort and advocacy. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.
