Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy. As an Arabic language model, I will be discussing the potential impacts of marital status on the lives of late pregnancy (third trimester) beginner Arabic speaker individuals.

Impact on Emotional Well-being:
