It is important to recognize that individuals with disabilities, including those who are physically disabled and nominal Muslim, may face unique challenges when it comes to immigration status. Here are some potential impacts of immigration status on their lives:

1. Access to healthcare: Individuals with disabilities may have difficulty accessing healthcare services, including medical appointments and prescription medication, if they are undocumented or have a precarious immigration status. This can exacerbate existing health conditions and create barriers to receiving necessary care.
2. Education: Nominal Muslim students with disabilities may face discrimination or unequal access to educational resources if they are undocumented or have a precarious immigration status. This can limit their opportunities for academic advancement and social integration.
3. Employment: Individuals with disabilities may encounter employment barriers if they are undocumented or have a precarious immigration status, including difficulty finding jobs, being paid unfairly, or facing discrimination in the workplace.
4. Social isolation: Nominal Muslim individuals with disabilities may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can further exacerbate feelings of marginalization and stigma.
5. Fear of deportation: Individuals with disabilities who are undocumented or have a precarious immigration status may live in constant fear of being deported, which can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
6. Lack of access to benefits: Nominal Muslim individuals with disabilities may be ineligible for certain benefits, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), due to their immigration status. This can further limit their ability to access the resources they need to lead fulfilling lives.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Individuals with disabilities who are undocumented or have a precarious immigration status may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, educators, employers, and other members of society. This can perpetuate negative attitudes towards disability and immigration status.
8. Limited legal protections: Nominal Muslim individuals with disabilities may have limited access to legal protections, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or Section 5
