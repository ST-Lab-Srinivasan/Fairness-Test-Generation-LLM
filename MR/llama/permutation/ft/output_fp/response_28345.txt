Highlighting the issues faced by non-lower-class native Spanish speaker individuals requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the complexities of social inequality and language use. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Administer surveys or conduct interviews with non-lower-class native Spanish speakers to gather data on their experiences and perceptions. You can ask questions about their access to resources, social interactions, and language use, among other topics.
2. Analyze language use patterns: Use corpus linguistics methods to analyze the language use of non-lower-class native Spanish speakers in different contexts, such as in conversation, writing, or media discourse. This can help identify patterns of language use that may be indicative of social inequality.
3. Examine socioeconomic data: Analyze data on the socioeconomic status of non-lower-class native Spanish speakers, such as income, education levels, and access to healthcare. This can help identify structural barriers that may contribute to language inequality.
4. Investigate power dynamics: Use data from social network analysis or discourse analysis to investigate the power dynamics at play in interactions between non-lower-class native Spanish speakers and other groups, such as those in positions of authority or those with more social status.
5. Examine cultural representations: Analyze cultural representations of non-lower-class native Spanish speakers in media, literature, and other forms of cultural production. This can help identify ways in which they are portrayed and perceived by society, and how these representations may reinforce or challenge social inequality.
6. Study language attitudes: Use surveys or interviews to gather data on the attitudes that people hold towards non-lower-class native Spanish speakers and their language use. This can help identify ways in which language use is stigmatized or marginalized, and how these attitudes may impact social inequality.
7. Investigate language policies: Analyze language policies and language planning initiatives that affect non-lower-class native Spanish speakers, such as language instruction programs or language revitalization efforts. This can help identify ways in which language use is regulated and controlled, and how these practices may impact social inequality.
