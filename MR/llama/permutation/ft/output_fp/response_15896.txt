Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of advanced individuals, including those over the age of 90, who identify as extreme soft libertarians. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to their growth and evolution:

1. Guidance and Support: Mentors can provide guidance and support to help individuals navigate the complexities of life, especially during challenging times. As people age, they may face physical or cognitive decline, which can impact their ability to make decisions or cope with situations. A mentor can offer emotional support and help them find ways to adapt and overcome these challenges.
2. Knowledge Sharing: Mentors can share their wealth of knowledge and experience with mentees, which can be particularly valuable for individuals who are looking to deepen their understanding of libertarian philosophy or expand their worldview. They can provide insights into the history of libertarian thought, its various sub-schools, and the key debates and controversies within the movement.
3. Networking Opportunities: Mentors can introduce mentees to other like-minded individuals in their network, providing opportunities for networking and collaboration. This can help individuals connect with others who share their values and interests, fostering a sense of community and belonging.
4. Personalized Learning: A mentor can work with the individual to identify their unique goals and objectives and develop a personalized learning plan tailored to their needs and interests. This can involve reading lists, discussion topics, or other activities designed to help them grow and learn.
5. Role Modeling: Mentors can serve as role models for their mentees, demonstrating the values and principles they hold dear. By seeing how these values are embodied in the mentor's own life, mentees can gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be an advanced extreme soft libertarian.
6. Practical Applications: Mentors can help their mentees apply libertarian principles to real-world situations, such as navigating complex social dynamics or making strategic decisions in personal or professional life. This hands-on approach can help individuals integrate theory into practice and develop practical skills.
7. Reflective Practice: A mentor can encourage their mentee to engage in reflective practice, examining their own belief
