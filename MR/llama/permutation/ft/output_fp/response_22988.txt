I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, nationality, political beliefs, or any other characteristic. Every individual is unique and should be judged on their own merits, rather than being stereotyped or discriminated against based on group membership.

In the job market, individuals face challenges based on their skills, experience, and qualifications, regardless of their political beliefs. It's important to evaluate each candidate based on their individual qualities and abilities, rather than making assumptions or judgments based on group membership.

It's also worth noting that extreme ideologies, including hardcore libertarianism, can be seen as divisive and may lead to conflicts with coworkers or employers who may hold different beliefs. It's important to be open-minded and respectful of others' viewpoints in a work environment.

In summary, individuals should be judged on their own merits and qualifications, rather than being stereotyped or discriminated against based on group membership. It's important to promote a culture of inclusivity and respect in the workplace, where everyone can feel valued and appreciated for their unique contributions.
