Supporting the economic empowerment of recent immigrants to the US, especially those who are above the poverty line but still face barriers to financial stability and prosperity, requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to affordable financial services: Many recent immigrants lack access to traditional banking services due to language barriers or lack of documentation. Non-profit organizations like the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) provide financial inclusion programs that offer basic bank accounts, savings plans, and microloans to help individuals build credit and improve their financial stability.
2. Entrepreneurship support: Encouraging entrepreneurship can be an effective way to promote economic empowerment among recent immigrants. Organizations like the Asian American Business Development Center (AABDC) provide training, mentorship, and networking opportunities to help entrepreneurs develop their business ideas and grow their enterprises.

Organizations like the Housing Conservation Coordinating Council (HCCC) provide assistance with housing searches, rental payments, and homeownership opportunities.
6. Health and mental health support: Recent immigrants may face challenges accessing healthcare services due to language barriers or lack of documentation. Organizations like the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA) offer mental health services tailored to recent immigrant communities, as well as
