Addressing the needs of recently divorced, multiple times ultra-conservative individuals in disaster response requires a tailored approach that considers their unique set of challenges and cultural background. Here are some strategies to help address their needs:

1. Respect their privacy and cultural values: Ultra-conservative individuals may feel uncomfortable seeking help from strangers, especially if they are recent divorcees. Ensure that your disaster response team is sensitive to their privacy and cultural values by providing individualized support without intruding on their personal space.
2. Provide gender-separate services: In ultra-conservative communities, women may face additional challenges during disaster responses. Providing gender-separate services, such as separate feeding centers or shelters for women and children, can help alleviate these concerns.
3. Offer culturally sensitive communication: Use language and communication methods that are appropriate for the local culture. For example, if the disaster response team is communicating with a predominantly Muslim community, they should use Arabic or another language spoken in the area to ensure cultural sensitivity.
4. Establish trust and credibility: Ultra-conservative individuals may be hesitant to seek help from outsiders, so it's essential to establish trust and credibility with your disaster response efforts. This can be achieved by working closely with local leaders and community members, being transparent about your organization's mission and methods, and consistently delivering on your promises.
5. Provide gender-sensitive relief items: When providing relief items, consider the specific needs of ultra-conservative individuals. For instance, provide separate hygiene kits for men and women, and ensure that all items are modestly packaged to respect their cultural values.
6. Train local volunteers: Involving local volunteers can help build trust and credibility with the community, especially among ultra-conservative individuals. Provide training on disaster response techniques, cultural sensitivity, and how to work effectively with diverse groups.
7. Create a safe space for women and children: In some cases, ultra-conservative communities may have strict gender segregation rules. Creating a separate shelter or feeding center for women and children can help ensure their safety
