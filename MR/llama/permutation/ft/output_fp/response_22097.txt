Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recent immigrants to India, especially those who identify as slightly bisexual, requires understanding and respecting their cultural backgrounds and identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Planning: When planning cultural events or celebrations, involve members of the LGBTQ+ community in the planning process. This will ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that they feel included.
2. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness about the LGBTQ+ community and their experiences. This can be done through workshops, training sessions, or cultural events that highlight the history and contributions of the LGBTQ+ community.
3. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using language that is derogatory or offensive to any particular group.
4. Visibility: Make sure that members of the LGBTQ+ community are visible and represented in cultural events and celebrations. This can be done by including them in planning committees, inviting them to speak or perform, or simply by showcasing their work.
5. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for members of the LGBTQ+ community to express themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can be done by providing a separate space for them during cultural events or by ensuring that the entire event is inclusive and respectful.
6. Community Engagement: Engage with the local LGBTQ+ community and involve them in cultural events and celebrations. This can be done by attending their events, supporting their causes, or simply by building relationships with them.
7. Cultural Exchange: Facilitate cultural exchange programs that allow members of the LGBTQ+ community to share their experiences and traditions with others. This can help promote understanding and respect for their cultural practices.
8. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural events and celebrations are accessible to everyone, including members of the LGBTQ+ community. This can be done by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or gender-neutral bathrooms.
9. Celebrating Diversity: Celebrate the diversity of the LGBTQ+ community and their cultural practices
