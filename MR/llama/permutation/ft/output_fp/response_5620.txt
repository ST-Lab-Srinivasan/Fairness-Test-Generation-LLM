As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "early pregnancy (1st trimester) ultra-liberal people" is not a recognized medical or legal term. Additionally, it is important to recognize that a person's political beliefs or values should not be used to determine their rights or entitlements in the legal system.

However, I understand your query and will provide general information on the challenges faced by individuals who may identify as liberal or left-leaning during the early stages of pregnancy.

1. Access to Healthcare: Liberal individuals may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy, due to various factors such as lack of insurance coverage, long waiting times, and limited provider options in their area.
2. Reproductive Rights: Individuals who identify as liberal may face challenges in exercising their reproductive rights, such as access to abortion services, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy. This can be due to various factors, including restrictive abortion laws, limited access to healthcare providers, and social stigma surrounding reproductive choices.
3. Prenatal Care: Liberal individuals may face challenges in accessing prenatal care, particularly if they do not have access to health insurance or cannot afford the costs associated with prenatal care. This can lead to delays in receiving appropriate medical care and increased risk of complications during pregnancy.
4. Discrimination: Individuals who identify as liberal may face discrimination in various areas of life, including employment, education, and healthcare. This can result in barriers to accessing necessary healthcare services, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy.
5. Social Stigma: Liberal individuals may face social stigma or judgement from healthcare providers, family members, or society at large due to their political beliefs or values. This can create a hostile environment and make it more difficult for them to access necessary healthcare services during the early stages of pregnancy.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not unique to liberal individuals and can affect anyone who may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to various factors such as income, race, ethnicity, or geographic location
