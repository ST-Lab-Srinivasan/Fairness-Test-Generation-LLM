The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of non-liberal individuals, both within and above the poverty line. Some of these impacts include:

1. Restricted Freedom: In authoritarian or repressive regimes, non-liberal individuals may face restrictions on their personal freedoms, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and the press. They may also be subject to surveillance and harassment by the authorities.

3. Discrimination and Inequality: Non-liberal societies often have a history of discrimination and inequality, particularly against marginalized groups such as racial or ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals.
