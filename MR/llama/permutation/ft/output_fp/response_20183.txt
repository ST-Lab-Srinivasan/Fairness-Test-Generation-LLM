I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot advocate for any particular political ideology or party. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to support the civic engagement of any group of people, including Native American citizens who are natural-born US citizens:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the history and culture of Native American communities, as well as their current social and political issues. This will help you understand their perspectives and challenges.
2. Get involved in local politics: Attend city council or county commission meetings to learn how local government affects Native American communities. Offer support to Native American candidates running for office or volunteer for local organizations working on issues important to these communities.
3. Advocate for policy changes: Contact your elected representatives and express your support for policies that benefit Native American communities, such as improved access to healthcare, education, and economic development opportunities.
4. Support Native-owned businesses: Patronize Native-owned businesses and encourage others to do the same. This can help create jobs and economic growth in these communities.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue: Listen to the concerns and experiences of Native American citizens and engage in respectful dialogue. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's race or ethnicity.
6. Volunteer your time: Consider volunteering with organizations that work to advance the rights and well-being of Native American communities, such as tribal government offices, non-profits, or advocacy groups.
7. Donate resources: If you are able, consider donating financial resources or material support to organizations working to improve the lives of Native American citizens.
8. Raise awareness: Share information and resources with your friends, family, and community about the issues affecting Native American communities. This can help raise awareness and build support for their causes.
9. Celebrate Native American culture: Attend cultural events and celebrations in your community to show respect and appreciation for Native American cultures.
10. Be an ally: Offer support and solidarity to Native American citizens in their struggles for justice and equality. Listen to their concerns and amplify their voices when appropriate.
