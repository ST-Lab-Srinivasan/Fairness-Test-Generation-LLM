Addressing the needs of non-lower-class beginner Chinese speaker individuals in disaster response requires a nuanced approach that considers their unique challenges and limitations. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide accessible information: In emergency situations, it is crucial to provide accurate and timely information to the public. However, for non-lower-class beginner Chinese speakers, accessing this information may be challenging due to language barriers. To address this, disaster response teams can use multiple channels to communicate, including visual aids, gestures, and simple language that is easy to understand.
2. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Disaster response teams should be culturally sensitive and aware of the unique needs of non-lower-class beginner Chinese speakers.

To address this, disaster response teams can offer tailored support that considers their specific circumstances.
