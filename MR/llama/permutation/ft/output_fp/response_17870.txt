Here are some ways to support the educational aspirations of beginner Chinese speakers who are long-time married couples:

1. Encourage and motivate each other: As a couple, you can encourage and motivate each other to learn Chinese. Share your goals and progress with each other, and celebrate small victories along the way.
2. Set realistic goals: Beginner Chinese speakers may have unrealistic expectations about how quickly they will progress. Help each other set realistic goals and milestones, and work towards them together.
3. Create a study schedule: Plan out a study schedule that works for both of you, taking into account your busy lives and other commitments. Make sure to set aside dedicated time each day or week to practice Chinese.
4. Use language learning apps: There are many language learning apps available that can help you learn Chinese at your own pace. Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone are popular options. You can also find apps specifically designed for couples, such as Memrise and Anki.
5. Practice together: Practice speaking and listening to Chinese together. You can find videos or podcasts online that you can listen to together, or you can practice speaking with each other using a language exchange app.
6. Immerse yourselves in the language: Listen to Chinese music, watch Chinese movies or TV shows with English subtitles, and read Chinese books or articles. The more you expose yourselves to the language, the faster you will learn.
7. Take a trip together: Consider taking a trip to a Chinese-speaking country to immerse yourselves in the language and culture. This can be a great way to accelerate your learning and create lasting memories together.
8. Use flashcards: Create flashcards with new vocabulary words and phrases and review them together. You can also use apps like Quizlet or Anki to create digital flashcards.
9. Practice active listening: When speaking Chinese, practice active listening by paying close attention to each other's pronunciation and grammar. Offer constructive feedback and encouragement to help each other improve.
10. Celebrate progress: Celebrate each other's progress and achievements, no matter how small. This will help keep you motivated and
