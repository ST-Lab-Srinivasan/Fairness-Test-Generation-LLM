Congratulations on your happy marriage! Here are some ways to support the mental health of newly married couples who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy:

1. Encourage open communication: Create a safe and non-judgmental space for both partners to express their thoughts, feelings, and concerns. Listen actively and without interrupting or offering unsolicited advice.
2. Practice empathy and validation: Try to see things from your partner's perspective and validate their emotions. Show understanding and compassion when they are struggling with mental health issues.
3. Support each other's goals and aspirations: Encourage each other to pursue their passions and dreams, and offer support and encouragement along the way.
4. Engage in regular date nights: Make time for each other and plan regular date nights or activities that you both enjoy. This can help strengthen your bond and reduce stress.
5. Prioritize self-care: Encourage each other to take breaks and engage in activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as exercise, meditation, or reading.
6. Seek professional help when needed: If either partner is struggling with mental health issues, such as depression or anxiety, seek professional help from a therapist or counselor.
7. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage each other to embrace challenges and view failures as opportunities for growth and learning.
8. Practice gratitude: Regularly express appreciation for each other and the positive aspects of your relationship.
9. Take breaks from technology: Set aside time each day to disconnect from screens and engage in activities that promote relaxation and bonding, such as board games or puzzles.
10. Cultivate a sense of humor: Laughter can be a powerful tool for reducing stress and improving mental health. Find ways to laugh together and enjoy each other's company.
