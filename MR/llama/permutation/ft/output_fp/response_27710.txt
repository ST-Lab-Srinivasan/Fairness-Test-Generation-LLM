Creating more inclusive social policies for recently divorced, multiple times, long-term, and undocumented individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by each group. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the intersectionality of identities: Recognize that individuals may belong to multiple marginalized groups, such as race, gender, sexuality, immigration status, and socioeconomic status. Policies should take into account the intersections of these identities and how they impact individuals' experiences.
2. Address the root causes of discrimination: Identify the systemic barriers and biases that contribute to the marginalization of recently divorced, multiple times, long-term, and undocumented individuals. Policies should aim to dismantle these systems of oppression and promote equity and inclusion.
3. Provide access to essential services: Ensure that all individuals have access to basic necessities like food, shelter, healthcare, education, and legal support. This can be achieved through targeted programs and resources tailored to the specific needs of each group.
4. Promote economic empowerment: Encourage financial stability by providing access to affordable housing, job training, and employment opportunities. This can help individuals build a stable financial foundation and reduce their reliance on government support.
5. Advocate for immigration reform: Work towards comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship for undocumented individuals, addresses the root causes of migration (e.g., poverty, violence), and recognizes the contributions of immigrant communities to society.

7. Foster inclusive social networks: Encourage cross-community dialogue and collaboration to break down silos and build bridges between different marginalized groups. This can be achieved through community events, peer support groups, and intercultural exchange programs.
8. Advocate for policy changes at the local and national levels: Work with policymakers to
