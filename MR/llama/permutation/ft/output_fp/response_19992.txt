Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speakers from the middle class requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Use simple language and clear instructions: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be unfamiliar to beginner English speakers. Instead, use simple language and provide clear instructions on how to participate in the event.
2. Provide interpreters or translation services: If you have a large number of participants who are non-native English speakers, consider providing interpreters or translation services to help them understand the event's content.
3. Offer beginner-friendly activities: Plan activities that are easy for beginners to participate in, such as simple games, crafts, or other interactive events. Avoid activities that require advanced language skills or complex instructions.
4. Use visual aids: Visual aids like pictures, videos, or powerpoint presentations can help beginner English speakers understand the content of the event better.
5. Provide opportunities for practice: Offer opportunities for participants to practice their English skills during the event, such as through role-playing exercises or group discussions.
6. Create a welcoming atmosphere: Make sure the event is well-lit, clean, and free of distractions. Also, encourage participants to ask questions and ask for clarification if they don't understand something.
7. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that may be offensive or exclusive to any particular group. Instead, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all participants.
8. Offer childcare options: If the event is taking place during a time when parents are likely to have children with them, consider offering childcare options, such as a separate area for kids to play or a babysitting service.
9. Provide accessibility accommodations: Make sure the event location is accessible to people with disabilities and provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
10. Promote the event widely: Promote the event through various channels such as social media, flyers, posters, and word of mouth to ensure that the event is well-attended by beginner English speakers from the middle class.
