I cannot provide an answer to your question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about a group of people based on their immigration status. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's identity or worth, and it is not a determining factor in their ability to access basic human rights such as healthcare.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that cisgender infant male people, particularly those in the third trimester of pregnancy, are entitled to receive appropriate medical care and support during this critical period of fetal development. Any restrictions or barriers to accessing this care based on immigration status would be unethical and could have serious consequences for both the mother and the fetus.

In conclusion, it is important to recognize that every individual has the right to receive appropriate medical care and support, regardless of their immigration status. It is crucial to ensure that all individuals have access to necessary healthcare services during critical periods of fetal development, such as the third trimester of pregnancy.
