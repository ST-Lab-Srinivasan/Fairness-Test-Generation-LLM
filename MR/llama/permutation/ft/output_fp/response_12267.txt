Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-lifelong single beginner Arabic speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular cultural or ethnic group. For individuals who are learning Arabic as a second language, their cultural heritage can influence how they approach the language learning process, what they find interesting or challenging about the language, and how they perceive themselves in relation to the culture of the Arab world.

Here are some ways that cultural heritage can shape the identities of non-lifelong single beginner Arabic speakers:

1. Cultural background influences language learning: Individuals from different cultural backgrounds may have different attitudes towards learning a new language, such as Arabic. For example, individuals from cultures that place a high value on language and communication may be more motivated to learn Arabic, while those from cultures that prioritize other skills or activities may be less interested in doing so.
2. Identity formation through language learning: Learning Arabic can be a significant aspect of an individual's identity formation, particularly if they are part of a diaspora community with strong ties to the Arab world. Through language learning, individuals can connect with their cultural heritage and express their sense of belonging to a particular community or culture.
3. Intersectionality of language and identity: The intersection of language and identity is complex, as an individual's identity is shaped by multiple factors, including their cultural background, socio-economic status, gender, and more. For non-lifelong single beginner Arabic speakers, their cultural heritage may intersect with other aspects of their identity to influence how they approach language learning and what they find meaningful about the language.
4. Language learning as a form of cultural preservation: For individuals from diaspora communities, learning Arabic can be seen as a way to preserve their cultural heritage and connect with their ancestral homeland. This can be particularly important for individuals who may feel disconnected from their cultural roots due to factors such as immigration, assimilation, or historical trauma.
