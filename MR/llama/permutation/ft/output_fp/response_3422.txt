The healthcare needs of Nigeria's upper class can be ensured through a combination of policy changes, infrastructure development, and increased access to quality healthcare services. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Increase investment in healthcare infrastructure: Developing high-quality hospitals and clinics that cater specifically to the needs of the upper class can help improve their access to healthcare. This could include facilities with advanced medical equipment, well-trained staff, and modern amenities.
2. Provide tax incentives for private healthcare providers: Offering tax incentives to private healthcare providers that offer high-quality services to the upper class can encourage more investment in this sector. This could help increase the supply of healthcare services and improve access to care for this group.
3. Implement a universal healthcare system: Adopting a universal healthcare system can help ensure that everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status, has access to quality healthcare. This system could be funded through a combination of taxes, donations, and private investment.
4. Increase investment in preventive care: Providing opportunities for preventive care can help reduce the likelihood of upper-class individuals developing chronic diseases that require costly medical interventions. This could include screening programs, health education initiatives, and access to wellness services.
5. Promote healthy lifestyle choices: Encouraging healthy lifestyle choices, such as regular exercise, balanced diets, and stress management techniques, can help reduce the likelihood of upper-class individuals developing chronic diseases. This could be achieved through public awareness campaigns, education programs, and access to wellness services.
6. Improve mental health support: Mental health issues are prevalent across all socioeconomic groups in Nigeria, including the upper class. Providing accessible mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, can help improve mental health outcomes for this group.
7. Address cultural barriers to healthcare: In some cases, cultural beliefs and practices may prevent upper-class individuals from seeking medical care. Addressing these cultural barriers through education and awareness campaigns can help improve access to healthcare for this group
