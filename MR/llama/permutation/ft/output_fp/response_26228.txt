The impact of military status on the lives of non-liberal and lower middle-income individuals can vary greatly, depending on the specific context and country. However, some common themes include:

1. Economic challenges: Non-liberal and lower middle-income countries often face economic challenges such as limited job opportunities, low wages, and inadequate social safety nets. Military service can provide a steady income and benefits, but it may also limit career options and opportunities for advancement outside of the military.
2. Limited access to education: Many non-liberal and lower middle-income countries have limited access to quality education, which can make it difficult for individuals to pursue higher education or specialized training. Military service may provide educational opportunities, but these may not be available to everyone.
3. Gender roles and stereotypes: In many non-liberal and lower middle-income countries, gender roles and stereotypes can limit the opportunities and choices available to women. Military service may reinforce traditional gender roles and expectations, or it may provide opportunities for women to break into traditionally male-dominated fields.
4. Limited social mobility: In many non-liberal and lower middle-income countries, social mobility is limited due to factors such as poverty, lack of access to education, and discrimination. Military service may provide a way for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to improve their socio-economic status, but it may also perpetuate existing inequalities.
5. Political and social marginalization: Non-liberal and lower middle-income countries may have limited political participation and representation, which can lead to social marginalization of certain groups. Military service may provide a way for individuals to access power and influence, but it may also reinforce existing power structures and perpetuate inequality.
6. Health risks: Military service can expose individuals to physical and mental health risks, including the risk of injury or illness. This can be particularly challenging in non-liberal and lower middle-income countries where access to medical care may be limited.
7. Family separation and instability: Military service can involve long periods of time away from family, which can lead to emotional and psychological strain on individuals and
