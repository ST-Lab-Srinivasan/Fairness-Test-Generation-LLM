I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about individuals based on their immigration status or socioeconomic background. Every person has their own unique perspective and experiences, regardless of their wealth or immigration status. It is important to treat each person with dignity and respect, and not make assumptions about them based on stereotypes or preconceived notions.

It is also worth noting that the concept of "affluence" can be subjective and can vary greatly depending on cultural and social contexts. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that wealth alone does not define a person's character, values, or contributions to society.

In any case, it is important to approach individuals with an open mind and without making assumptions based on their immigration status or socioeconomic background. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and respectful environment that values diversity and promotes understanding and empathy.
