Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the Community: Begin by researching and understanding the specific needs and interests of the Asian community in your area. This can involve conducting surveys, interviews, or focus groups to gather information about their cultural backgrounds, language learning goals, and preferred learning methods.
2. Use Inclusive Language Materials: Develop language learning materials that reflect the diversity of the Asian community. This can include using images, videos, and audio recordings that depict people from different Asian countries and cultures. Additionally, use language learning materials that are specifically designed for beginners, such as Rosetta Stone's "Asian Languages" series.
3. Offer Cultural Immersion Activities: Provide opportunities for learners to engage in cultural immersion activities, such as cooking classes, dance workshops, or traditional music performances. These activities can help learners develop a deeper appreciation for the cultures they are studying and provide a fun and interactive way to practice their language skills.
4. Create a Supportive Learning Environment: Foster a supportive and inclusive learning environment by providing opportunities for learners to connect with one another and share their experiences. This can be done through peer-to-peer language exchange programs, cultural events, or simply creating a welcoming atmosphere in the classroom.
5. Provide Accessibility Options: Ensure that all cultural programs are accessible to learners with different abilities by providing accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, closed captioning, or audio descriptions.
6. Collaborate with Community Organizations: Partner with local community organizations that serve the Asian community to co-host cultural events and language classes. This can help increase attendance and provide learners with a sense of belonging.
7. Celebrate Cultural Diversity: Celebrate the diverse cultures of the Asian community by incorporating their traditions, customs, and holidays into language learning programs. This can include teaching learners about different Asian festivals, foods, and cultural practices.
8. Provide Language Training for Teachers: Offer language training for teachers who work with Asian learners
