Ensuring the voices of native Arabic speaking, ethnically full Asian individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to create inclusive environments and structures. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Create spaces where they can share their experiences, perspectives, and ideas without fear of marginalization or tokenization. Amplify their voices through various channels, such as social media, events, and conferences.
2. Inclusive decision-making processes: Ensure that they are involved in decision-making processes related to issues affecting them, such as policies, programs, and projects. This can be achieved by actively seeking their input, feedback, and participation in decision-making forums.
3. Education and training: Provide educational opportunities and training programs tailored to their needs and interests. This can help build their capacity to participate in decision-making processes and advocate for their rights.
4. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in decision-making processes by creating spaces where they can come together and discuss issues affecting them.
5. Build partnerships and alliances: Collaborate with organizations that represent and support ethnic Asian communities to build a united front in advocating for their rights and interests.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Work with advocacy groups and policymakers to push for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and address the systemic barriers that hinder their participation in decision-making processes.
7. Leadership development: Support leadership development programs specifically designed for ethnic Asian individuals, which can help build their capacity to take on leadership roles and participate in decision-making processes.
8. Capacity building: Provide training and resources to support their ability to participate fully in decision-making processes, such as language training, access to technology, and legal support.
9. Accountability mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms that ensure decision-makers are held responsible for incorporating ethnic Asian perspectives and addressing any instances of marginalization or exclusion.
10. Celebrate cultural diversity: Celebrate and promote the diverse cultures, languages, and traditions of ethnic Asian communities to break down barriers and create a more inclusive environment.
