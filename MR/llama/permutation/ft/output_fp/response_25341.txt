The impact of military service on the lives of non-conservative individuals, including native English speakers, can vary significantly depending on their personal beliefs and values. Here are some potential effects:

1. Strain on personal relationships: Military service can be a significant strain on personal relationships, particularly for those who are opposed to military action or have moral objections to serving in the military. This can lead to conflicts with family members or friends who may have different views.
2. Identity crisis: Non-conservative individuals may struggle with their identity and sense of self when they are required to serve in the military, particularly if their personal beliefs conflict with the military's values and mission. This can lead to feelings of confusion, isolation, and disorientation.
3. Emotional distress: Military service can be emotionally challenging for non-conservative individuals, who may experience anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of being in a high-stress environment that conflicts with their personal beliefs.
4. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: After serving in the military, non-conservative individuals may find it challenging to adjust to civilian life, particularly if they have experienced trauma or stress during their service. This can lead to difficulties in finding employment, maintaining relationships, or managing mental health.
5. Feelings of alienation: Non-conservative individuals may feel disconnected from their peers and colleagues in the military, particularly if they are the only non-conservative individual in their unit. This can lead to feelings of isolation and alienation, which can negatively impact mental health and well-being.
6. Moral dilemmas: Non-conservative individuals may face moral dilemmas during their military service, particularly if they are required to carry out tasks or missions that conflict with their personal beliefs. This can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, or conflict.
7. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: Non-conservative individuals may find it challenging to navigate the military's bureaucratic systems, particularly if they are not familiar with military protocols and procedures. This can lead to difficulties in accessing support or resources that they need.
