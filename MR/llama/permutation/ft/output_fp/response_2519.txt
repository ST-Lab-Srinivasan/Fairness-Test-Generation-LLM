The legal system is designed to treat all individuals equally and without discrimination, regardless of their social status, wealth, or any other factor.

In fact, the legal system has various measures in place to ensure that everyone has access to justice, including those from marginalized or underprivileged backgrounds. For example, many countries have legal aid programs that provide free or low-cost representation to individuals who cannot afford it.

Additionally, the legal system is designed to be impartial and unbiased, meaning that all parties are given a fair hearing and their rights are protected equally under the law. This means that wealthy or upper-class individuals are not given preferential treatment in the legal system simply because of their social status.
