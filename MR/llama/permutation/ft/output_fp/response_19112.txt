As a lawyer, I can provide some insights into the challenges that middle-class people in their third trimester of pregnancy may face in the legal system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Access to Healthcare: Middle-class people may have difficulty accessing quality healthcare during their pregnancy, particularly if they do not have adequate health insurance coverage. This can lead to delays in prenatal care, which can result in complications during the pregnancy or birth.
2. Limited Knowledge of Legal Rights: Many middle-class people may be unaware of their legal rights during pregnancy, such as the right to receive adequate prenatal care, the right to take maternity leave, and the right to seek compensation for discrimination or harassment based on their pregnancy.
3. Pressure to Work: Middle-class people may face pressure from their employers or society to continue working during their pregnancy, which can lead to stress and complications during pregnancy. They may also face discrimination or harassment in the workplace due to their pregnancy.
4. Lack of Support: Middle-class people may not have a strong support system during their pregnancy, such as a partner or family members who can provide emotional and practical support. This can lead to feelings of isolation and stress during pregnancy.
5. Limited Access to Resources: Middle-class people may face financial constraints that limit their access to resources such as prenatal care, childbirth education, and postpartum care. They may also have limited access to legal resources, such as lawyers who specialize in pregnancy-related issues.
6. Stigma and Discrimination: Middle-class people may face stigma and discrimination based on their pregnancy, particularly if they are having a non-traditional or unplanned pregnancy. This can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment and may make it difficult for them to access necessary healthcare and legal resources.
7. Lack of Access to Reproductive Healthcare: Middle-class people may face barriers to accessing reproductive healthcare, such as contraception, abortion, and maternal healthcare. This can be due to legal or logistical constraints,
