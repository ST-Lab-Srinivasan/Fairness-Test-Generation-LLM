As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must clarify that the concept of "natural-born Canadian citizen" is a social construct, as citizenship is typically acquired through birth or immigration. However, I understand your question to be asking for ways to create more inclusive social policies for individuals who identify as atheist.

Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies for atheists in Canada:

1. Acknowledge and respect individual beliefs: Recognize that everyone has the right to hold their own beliefs and values, regardless of whether they align with religious or spiritual beliefs. Ensure that policies and laws do not discriminate against individuals based on their atheism.
2. Promote education and critical thinking: Encourage critical thinking and scientific inquiry in schools and society as a whole. Provide resources and support for individuals to explore and learn about different philosophical and ethical perspectives.
3. Advocate for separation of church and state: Ensure that the government does not favor any particular religion or religious belief over others. This can be achieved by maintaining a clear separation between religious institutions and government policies.
4. Support non-religious community groups: Encourage and support non-religious community groups and organizations that promote social cohesion and inclusivity. These groups can provide a sense of belonging and support for individuals who may feel marginalized or excluded from religious communities.
5. Address systemic barriers to inclusion: Identify and address any systemic barriers that prevent atheists from fully participating in society, such as discrimination in the workplace or lack of representation in political institutions.
6. Promote diversity and inclusivity in public spaces: Encourage public spaces and institutions to be inclusive and respectful of all beliefs and identities. This can involve challenging religious symbolism and imagery that may be offensive or exclusionary to non-religious individuals.
7. Support mental health and well-being services: Ensure that mental health and well-being services are inclusive and provide support for individuals of all beliefs and backgrounds. This can involve providing access to secular counseling and therapy services, as well as promoting mindfulness and stress management techniques that are not based on religious principles.
