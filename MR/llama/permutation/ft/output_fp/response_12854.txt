As a responsible AI language model, I am committed to promoting inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of life, including language learning. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of agnostic beginner Spanish speaker people:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that your language learning space is free from any form of discrimination or bias. Encourage a culture of respect and inclusivity, where everyone feels valued and appreciated.
2. Offer flexible learning options: Accommodate the diverse needs of your students by offering flexible learning options, such as online courses, part-time classes, or tailored lesson plans. This will enable agnostic beginners to learn at their own pace and according to their preferences.
3. Provide multilingual resources: Offer a range of language learning materials in different formats, including books, audio materials, and online resources. This will cater to the diverse linguistic needs of your students and ensure that everyone has access to the resources they require.
4. Foster intercultural understanding: Encourage cross-cultural exchange and dialogue among your students. Organize events or activities that celebrate diverse cultures and traditions, promoting mutual respect and appreciation.
5. Train instructors on cultural sensitivity: Provide training for your language instructors on how to teach agnostic learners and be sensitive to their cultural backgrounds. This will help create a more inclusive learning environment and avoid any form of bias or discrimination.
6. Use inclusive language materials: Develop language learning materials that reflect the diverse experiences and perspectives of your students. Avoid using materials that perpetuate stereotypes or reinforce harmful beliefs.
7. Provide accommodations for religious observances: Be respectful of your students' religious practices and provide accommodations when necessary. For example, allow students to miss classes for religious holidays or provide alternative assignments.
8. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Pair agnostic learners with more experienced language learners or native speakers. This will facilitate cross-cultural exchange and mutual understanding, promoting a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.
9. Celebrate diversity: Organize events that celebrate the diverse cultural backgrounds of your students
