Addressing the Needs of Non-Disabled Native Natural-Born US Citizen Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
In any disaster response operation, it is essential to consider the needs of all individuals affected, including those who are not disabled. However, non-disabled Native natural-born US citizen individuals may face unique challenges during disaster responses due to factors such as language barriers, cultural differences, and systemic inequalities.
