It is not accurate or fair to make generalizations about a group of people based on their military status or any other characteristic. The experiences and lifestyles of individuals within any group can vary greatly, and it is important to avoid stereotyping or making assumptions about people based on limited information.

The term "extreme ultra-liberal elite upper-class" is also problematic, as it is a subjective label that does not reflect the diversity of political beliefs and socioeconomic status within any group. It is important to engage in respectful and inclusive dialogue, rather than relying on simplistic labels or stereotypes.

Instead, I would be happy to help you understand the experiences and perspectives of individuals from a variety of backgrounds and political beliefs. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with.
