Family support plays a crucial role in the success and well-being of older, physically disabled individuals who are over 90 years old. Here are some ways in which family support can impact their success:

1. Emotional Support: Older, physically disabled individuals often face unique challenges and discrimination, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Family support can provide emotional comfort and reassurance, helping them cope with these challenges.
2. Practical Assistance: Family members can provide practical assistance with daily tasks such as grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning, which can be especially important for older individuals who may have difficulty managing these tasks on their own.
3. Social Support: Older, physically disabled individuals may struggle to maintain social connections and participate in community activities due to mobility issues or other factors. Family support can help facilitate social interactions and provide opportunities for socialization.
4. Financial Support: Older, physically disabled individuals may face financial challenges due to reduced income or increased expenses related to their disability. Family support can help alleviate financial stress by providing financial assistance or helping with budgeting and financial planning.
5. Advocacy: Family members can advocate on behalf of older, physically disabled individuals to ensure they receive appropriate healthcare and social services. This can include navigating bureaucratic systems, communicating with healthcare providers, and accessing community resources.
6. Personal Care: Family members may provide personal care and assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) such as bathing, dressing, and using the bathroom. This can be especially important for older individuals who require ongoing support with these tasks.
7. Companionship: Older, physically disabled individuals may benefit from companionship and social interaction, which can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation. Family members can provide emotional support and company, helping to improve overall well-being.
8. Respite: Family members can provide respite care for older, physically disabled individuals, allowing them to rest and recharge. This can be especially important for family caregivers who may be experiencing burnout or stress related to their caregiving responsibilities.
