Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Arabic speakers and average income earners can be achieved by taking into consideration their needs, preferences, and limitations. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for people with limited mobility or transportation options. Offer wheelchair accessibility, accessible parking, and clear signage.
2. Language support: Provide interpreters or bilingual staff to help beginner Arabic speakers navigate the event. This can include translation support for signage, marketing materials, and announcements.
3. Affordable prices: Set ticket prices that are affordable for average income earners. Offer discounts or scholarships for those who cannot afford the full price.
4. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and customs when planning the event. For example, consider the dress code, food options, and activities to ensure they are inclusive and respectful.
5. Outreach and promotion: Reach out to local Arabic communities, schools, and organizations to promote the event. Use social media platforms and community newsletters to spread the word.
6. Inclusive programming: Offer activities and workshops that cater to different skill levels and interests. This can include beginner-friendly language classes, cultural performances, or art exhibitions.
7. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage volunteers from the local community to help with event planning, setup, and execution. This can help build a sense of ownership and inclusivity.
8. Community engagement: Involve the local community in the planning process by soliciting feedback and suggestions. This can help ensure that the event is tailored to meet the needs and preferences of the target audience.
9. Accessible communication: Provide accessible communication channels, such as large print materials or audio descriptions, for those who may have difficulty reading or seeing.
10. Flexibility: Be flexible with scheduling and logistics to accommodate different schedules and needs. For example, offer event sessions at different times or locations to cater to a variety of preferences.

By incorporating these suggestions into your community event planning, you can create a more inclusive and accessible environment for beginner Arabic speakers and average income earners.
