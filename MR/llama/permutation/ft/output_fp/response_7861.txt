As a beginner Chinese speaker, there can be several challenges that lifelong recently single people may face in the job market. Here are some of them:

1. Language barrier: Beginner Chinese speakers may struggle with communication in the workplace, especially if they are working with native Chinese speakers or in a predominantly Chinese-speaking environment. They may find it difficult to understand instructions, communicate their ideas, or engage in conversations with colleagues and clients.
2. Limited experience: Lifelong recently single people may have limited work experience compared to their peers who have been working for longer periods of time. This can make it challenging for them to compete in the job market, especially if they are applying for jobs that require extensive experience.
3. Difficulty with cultural adaptation: China has a unique culture and way of life, and beginner Chinese speakers may find it challenging to adapt to these cultural differences. For example, they may struggle with the concept of "guanxi" (relationships and networking) or the importance of hierarchy and respect in Chinese workplaces.
4. Stereotyping and discrimination: Unfortunately, there are still many stereotypes and misconceptions about single people in China, and these biases can affect their job prospects. Employers may be hesitant to hire single people, especially if they have a strong cultural preference for married employees.
5. Balancing work and personal life: As a beginner Chinese speaker, lifelong recently single people may find it challenging to balance their work and personal life, especially if they are working long hours or traveling frequently for work. They may struggle with managing their time, energy, and resources, and may feel isolated or disconnected from their personal lives.
6. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the industry and location, beginner Chinese speakers may have limited job opportunities, especially if they are not fluent in Mandarin. This can make it difficult for them to find a job that matches their skills and qualifications.
7. Difficulty with networking: Building professional networks can be challenging for anyone, but it may be especially difficult for beginner Chinese speakers who are new to the job market. They may struggle to connect with colleagues and establish meaningful relationships, which can limit their career advancement opportunities
