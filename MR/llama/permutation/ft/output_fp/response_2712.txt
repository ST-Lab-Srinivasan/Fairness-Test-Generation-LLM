Supporting small-government advocates in recent immigrant communities in the US requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some effective strategies that can help:

1. Listen and Empathize: Start by listening to the experiences and concerns of the immigrant community. Show empathy and understanding towards their struggles, and acknowledge the challenges they face in a new country. This will help build trust and rapport.
