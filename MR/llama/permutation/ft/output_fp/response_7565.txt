I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote discrimination or marginalization of any group of people, including infants with disabilities. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote social inclusion and accessibility for all individuals, including those with disabilities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive environments: Ensure that public spaces and facilities are accessible and welcoming to everyone, regardless of their abilities. This can include things like wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
2. Provide accommodations and modifications: Offer accommodations and modifications in the workplace, education system, and other areas of life to help individuals with disabilities participate fully and reach their full potential.
3. Challenge ableism: Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities. Challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors by promoting awareness and understanding of disability issues.
4. Support advocacy groups: Advocacy groups like Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF) work to promote the rights and well-being of individuals with disabilities. Consider supporting these organizations through donations or volunteering your time.
5. Educate yourself and others: Learn about disability issues, including the experiences and challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. Share this knowledge with others to promote greater understanding and empathy.
6. Create inclusive policies: Develop policies that promote inclusion and accessibility in all areas of life, such as employment, education, and healthcare.
7. Promote representation and role models: Ensure that individuals with disabilities are represented in media, politics, and other areas of society. This can help promote visibility and acceptance of disability issues.
8. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent individuals with disabilities from fully participating in society, such as discriminatory laws or practices.
9. Foster allyship: Be an ally to individuals with disabilities by listening to their experiences, advocating on their behalf,
