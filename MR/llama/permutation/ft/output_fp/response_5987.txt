Promoting the social inclusion of recent immigrants to Canada who identify as non-binary or partially identifying within the LGBTQ+ community requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these individuals. Here are some strategies that can be implemented actively:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide training and workshops for employers, service providers, and community members on non-binary identity, the experiences of immigrant non-binary individuals, and how to provide inclusive services. This can help reduce stigma and discrimination and promote a more understanding and welcoming environment.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services for immigrants who may not speak English or French fluently, including interpretation and translation services. This can help ensure that they have access to the same opportunities and resources as other Canadians.
3. Community Building: Facilitate the creation of non-binary specific community groups or events where immigrants can connect with others who share similar experiences. This can help build a sense of belonging and support network, which is essential for social inclusion.
4. Healthcare Access: Advocate for improved access to healthcare services for immigrant non-binary individuals, including gender-affirming care and mental health support. This can help address the specific healthcare needs of this community and promote overall well-being.
5. Legal Support: Provide legal support and resources to help immigrant non-binary individuals navigate the complexities of Canadian law, including issues related to identity documentation, employment, and housing.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Work with advocacy groups and policymakers to push for policy changes that support the social inclusion of non-binary immigrants, such as changing legal gender categories or implementing inclusive identity documents.
7. Economic Empowerment: Support immigrant non-binary individuals in accessing job training and employment opportunities, including mentorship programs and career development resources. This can help reduce poverty and economic marginalization within the community.
8. Housing Support: Advocate for affordable and inclusive housing options that cater to the specific needs of non-binary immigrants, including those who may be experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity.
9. Cultural Events: Organize cultural events
