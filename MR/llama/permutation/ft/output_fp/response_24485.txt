Creating more inclusive community events for recently arrived, undocumented individuals who are turning 65 requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Language support: Provide interpretation or translation services in the event's language(s) to ensure that all attendees can fully participate. This may include hiring interpreters or using technology like live translation apps.
2. Accessibility accommodations: Ensure that the event space is wheelchair accessible and has adequate seating, lighting, and ventilation for all attendees. Provide additional accommodations, such as reserved seating for those with mobility issues or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds and traditions of the newly arrived, undocumented community members. Incorporate elements that reflect their culture, such as food, music, or art. This can help them feel more comfortable and included in the event.
4. Age-appropriate activities: Design activities that cater to the age range of the attendees, including intergenerational events that bring together individuals of different ages. This can help build connections between older and younger community members.
5. Safe space guidelines: Establish a safe space policy for the event, which includes guidelines for respectful communication, consent, and conflict resolution. This can help create a positive and inclusive environment for all attendees.
6. Inclusive marketing: Develop marketing materials that are accessible to a diverse audience, including individuals with disabilities or limited English proficiency. Use language that is clear and concise, and provide alternative formats upon request.
7. Volunteer training: Provide training for volunteers on how to interact with and support undocumented community members. This may include information on cultural sensitivity, language support, and accessibility accommodations.
8. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to raise awareness about the event and encourage participation from diverse segments of the population. Utilize trusted community organizations and leaders to help promote the event.
9. Collaboration with local authorities: Work with local government agencies, such as social services or public health depart
