Lower-class individuals in the third trimester of pregnancy face significant challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Lower-class individuals may not have access to quality prenatal care, which can lead to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. They may also face barriers in accessing obstetric care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.
2. Financial constraints: Pregnancy and childbirth can be expensive, and lower-class individuals may struggle to cover the costs of prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. They may also face challenges in affording necessities for their newborns, such as diapers, formula, and clothing.
3. Lack of transportation: Lower-class individuals may not have reliable transportation to access healthcare services, which can lead to missed appointments or delays in receiving care. They may also face challenges in getting to the hospital for delivery, particularly if they live in rural areas.
4. Limited social support: Lower-class individuals may not have a support system of family and friends to help them during pregnancy and after childbirth. They may feel isolated and alone in their journey, which can lead to emotional distress and feelings of hopelessness.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Lower-class individuals may face discrimination and stigma due to their socioeconomic status. They may be viewed as "unfit" or "irresponsible" for being pregnant outside of marriage or in a non-traditional relationship. This can lead to additional stress and emotional distress during pregnancy.
6. Limited legal rights: Lower-class individuals may not have the same legal rights as their more affluent counterparts. For example, they may not have access to the same level of reproductive healthcare, including contraception and abortion services. They may also face challenges in accessing child custody and support services after birth.
7. Lack of education and resources: Lower-class individuals may not have access to education and resources on pregnancy and childbirth. This can lead to a lack of knowledge about prenatal care, labor and delivery, and postpartum care, which can result in negative outcomes
