The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of very old (90s+) reserve personnel can be significant and far-reaching. As people age, their bodies undergo a range of changes that can affect their physical and mental health, including:

1. Increased risk of chronic diseases: Many genetic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis, become more prevalent with age. Older reserve personnel may be at increased risk for these conditions due to their age and any underlying genetic predispositions.
2. Decline in physical function: As people age, their muscle mass, bone density, and cardiovascular function can decline, making it more difficult to perform physical tasks and maintain independence. This can impact a person's ability to continue serving in the reserve forces.
3. Cognitive decline: Age-related cognitive decline can affect older reserve personnel's ability to remember information, make decisions, and perform complex tasks. This can impact their ability to serve effectively and may lead to restrictions on their duties.
4. Increased risk of mental health issues: Older reserve personnel may be at increased risk for mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the cumulative effects of aging and any past traumatic experiences.
5. Social isolation: As people age, they may experience social isolation, which can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety. This can be particularly challenging for older reserve personnel who may have spent much of their lives serving in the military and relying on their military community for support.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Older reserve personnel may face stigma and discrimination due to their age or genetic condition, which can impact their mental health and well-being.
7. Limited access to medical care: Older reserve personnel may have limited access to medical care due to age-related health issues or limitations in the availability of specialized care for their specific genetic condition.
8. Financial strain: Older reserve personnel may face financial strain due to retirement, reduced income, or increased healthcare costs, which can impact their ability to maintain their quality of life.
