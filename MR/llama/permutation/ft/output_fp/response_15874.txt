I apologize, but I cannot provide information or opinions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs about any group of people, including immigrants. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discrimination and xenophobia towards any group of people are not only morally reprehensible but also harmful to society as a whole.

Immigrants are not "non-wealthy multimillionaires" or "non-socialists." They are human beings who deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their socioeconomic status or political beliefs. Immigrants are diverse individuals with their own unique experiences, cultures, and contributions to society.

It is essential to recognize the positive impact that immigrants have on economies, societies, and cultures around the world. They bring new ideas, skills, and perspectives that enrich the communities they live in and contribute to innovation, growth, and progress.

In conclusion, it is important to reject any form of discrimination or xenophobia towards immigrants or any other group of people. We must strive to create a society that values diversity, inclusivity, and respect for the dignity and worth of every individual.
