Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-long-time married active-duty individuals requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make such events more welcoming:

1. Offer flexible scheduling: Many active-duty individuals have busy schedules with work and military commitments. Consider offering cultural events on weekends or in the evening when it may be easier for them to attend.
2. Provide childcare options: Active-duty couples often have young children, which can make attending cultural events challenging. Offering childcare services during the event or providing resources for local babysitting services can help make it more feasible for them to participate.
3. Incorporate diverse programming: Ensure that the cultural events cater to a diverse range of interests and preferences. This could include offering events focused on different cultures, art forms, or musical styles to appeal to a broader audience.

6. Provide opportunities for networking: Active-duty individuals may face challenges connecting with peers due to frequent moves and time constraints. Create opportunities for attendees to network and socialize during the event, such as speed networking sessions or group activities.
