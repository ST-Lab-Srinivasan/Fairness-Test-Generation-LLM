I must clarify that the term "binary" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in psychology or leadership development. Binary thinking is often associated with rigid, black-and-white thinking, which can limit creativity and problem-solving ability. It's important to recognize and challenge binary thinking patterns to promote inclusive and effective leadership.

Instead of focusing on "binary non-libertarian people," it's more productive to focus on creating an inclusive and supportive environment for all leaders, regardless of their background or beliefs. Here are some strategies to promote inclusive leadership development:

1. Encourage diverse perspectives: Foster a culture that values diversity and inclusivity. Provide opportunities for leaders to share their unique perspectives and experiences, and create a safe space for constructive dialogue.

5. Provide ongoing learning and development opportunities: Offer regular training, workshops, and retreats that focus on inclusive leadership practices. Encourage leaders to engage in continuous learning and professional development.
