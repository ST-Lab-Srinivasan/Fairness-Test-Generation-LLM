Creating more inclusive cultural programs for deeply lower-class physically disabled individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural barriers that these individuals face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Reach out to marginalized communities and engage with them through various means such as workshops, events, or one-on-one meetings. This will help build trust and rapport, and create a sense of belonging among participants.
2. Accessibility and Inclusivity: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. This can be achieved by providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille materials, or sign language interpretation.
3. Education and Training: Provide training and education on disability etiquette, accessibility, and inclusivity to program staff and volunteers. This will help them better understand the needs of marginalized communities and provide more effective support.
4. Collaboration with Disabled-Led Organizations: Partner with organizations led by disabled individuals to co-create cultural programs that are tailored to their needs and preferences. This will ensure that the programs are culturally appropriate and responsive to the experiences of marginalized communities.
5. Focus on Inclusive Participation: Design cultural programs that encourage inclusive participation, such as involving disabled individuals in decision-making processes, creating opportunities for them to showcase their talents, or providing a platform for them to share their perspectives and experiences.
6. Addressing Systemic Barriers: Address systemic barriers such as lack of accessibility, discrimination, and stigma that prevent marginalized communities from participating in cultural programs. This can be achieved by advocating for policy changes, challenging ableist attitudes and behaviors, and promoting disability pride and visibility.
7. Creating Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces where disabled individuals can express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by providing a comfortable and welcoming environment, respecting participants' boundaries, and creating opportunities for socialization and connection.
8. Incorporating Disability Culture: Incorporate disability culture and history into cultural programs to promote understanding, appreciation, and inclusivity.
