As a language learning expert, I believe that recently single beginner Chinese speakers who are also PhD holders have unique needs and challenges when it comes to learning a new language. Here are some suggestions on how to address these specific needs:

1. Personalized learning: Recognize that each individual has their own learning style and pace, and tailor the learning materials and methods accordingly. This may involve creating customized lesson plans, providing opportunities for one-on-one instruction, or offering flexible scheduling options.
2. Building confidence: As PhD holders, these individuals may have a strong academic background but lack experience in speaking Chinese. To build their confidence, provide opportunities for them to practice speaking and listening to the language in a supportive environment. This could involve pairing them with native Chinese speakers or providing access to interactive language learning tools.
3. Cultural immersion: Encourage cultural immersion by exposing learners to authentic materials such as books, films, and music. This can help them develop a deeper understanding of the language and culture, and improve their overall proficiency.
4. Time management: As PhD holders, these individuals may have demanding academic schedules or research projects. To accommodate their busy schedules, offer flexible learning options such as online courses, podcasts, or mobile apps that can be accessed on the go.
5. Access to resources: Provide access to a range of language learning resources such as textbooks, workbooks, and audio materials. This can help learners supplement their coursework and practice their language skills outside of class.
6. Ongoing support: Offer ongoing support and feedback throughout the learning process. This could involve regular progress evaluations, additional tutorials or coaching sessions, or access to a language learning community where learners can connect with peers and share tips and resources.
7. Cultural exchange opportunities: Organize cultural exchange events or homestays with native Chinese speakers. This can provide learners with an immersive experience and an opportunity to practice their language skills in real-world situations.
8. Personalized feedback: Offer personalized feedback on learners' language use, including grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. This can help them identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time.
9. Technology integration: Integrate technology into
