As an AI language model, I cannot generalize all natural-born Indian citizen individuals aged 13-15; however, I can provide some common challenges faced by young adolescents (13-15 years old) in India's healthcare system based on available data and research:

1. Lack of awareness: Many young teens may not be aware of the importance of preventive care, leading to delays in seeking medical attention for minor ailments or avoiding it altogether.
2. Limited accessibility: Rural areas often face challenges in accessing healthcare facilities due to geographical barriers or a lack of specialized services. Young teens living in these areas may have limited access to quality healthcare.
3. Cost and financial burden: Medical expenses can be expensive, especially for families with lower socio-economic status. The financial burden of seeking medical attention can deter young teens from seeking necessary care.

9. Limited parental involvement: Parents or guardians may not always be aware of the importance of preventive care or may not prioritize their child's health, leading to limited involvement in seeking medical attention when needed.
10. Transportation challenges:
