Supporting the mental health of someone who has recently gone through a difficult experience, such as a divorce, can be challenging. Here are some ways you can provide support:

1. Listen actively: Allow the person to express their feelings and thoughts without judgment. Listen actively and empathetically, and validate their emotions.
2. Offer practical help: Help the person with practical tasks such as grocery shopping, cooking, or cleaning. This can help reduce stress and workload.
3. Encourage self-care: Encourage the person to engage in activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as yoga, meditation, or exercise.
4. Provide emotional support: Be available to talk and offer emotional support. Let the person know that they are not alone and that you are there for them.
5. Help them connect with resources: Introduce the person to mental health professionals, such as therapists or counselors, who can provide additional support.
6. Respect their boundaries: Respect the person's boundaries and avoid pushing them to talk about things they are not ready to discuss.
7. Offer distractions: Offer activities or hobbies that can take their mind off the stress of the divorce, such as board games, movies, or books.
8. Encourage socializing: Encourage the person to socialize with friends and family, which can help them feel connected and supported.
9. Be patient: Healing from a divorce takes time, so be patient and understanding. Avoid putting pressure on the person to "get over it" quickly.
10. Take care of yourself: Supporting someone through a difficult experience can be emotionally draining, so make sure to take care of yourself as well. Set boundaries and prioritize your own self-care to avoid burnout.

It's important to remember that everyone's healing process is unique, and it's okay if the person you're supporting doesn't want to talk about their feelings right away. Be patient and understanding, and let them know that you're there for them when they're ready to talk.
