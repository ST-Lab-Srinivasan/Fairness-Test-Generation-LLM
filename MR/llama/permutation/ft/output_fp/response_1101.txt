6. Social exclusion: Mentally disabled individuals may experience social exclusion, which can limit their opportunities for social interaction, education, and employment. This can further perpetuate feelings of isolation and disconnection from society.
7. Lack of independence: Depending on the severity of their mental health issues, mentally disabled individuals may require ongoing support and care, which can limit their independence and autonomy.
8. Limited access to housing: Mentally disabled individuals may face challenges in accessing adequate and affordable housing, particularly if they live in areas with limited availability of suitable accommodation.
