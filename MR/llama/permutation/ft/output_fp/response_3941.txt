Promoting the educational success of Native American recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that educators, policymakers, and community leaders can implement:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training for teachers on culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge and value the cultural backgrounds of Native American students. This can help create a more inclusive learning environment.
2. Bilingual education: Offer bilingual education programs that support Native American students' language development and academic success. This can involve providing instruction in both English and their native language, as well as offering translation services for families.
3. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Native American students with experienced educators or peers who can provide guidance and support. This can help build a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation.
4. Cultural enrichment activities: Organize cultural enrichment activities, such as traditional music, dance, and art workshops, that allow Native American students to connect with their heritage and express themselves creatively.
5. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities and organizations to provide additional support for Native American students. This can involve offering tutoring services, academic clubs, or extracurricular activities that promote cultural exchange.
6. Identity-based curriculum: Incorporate Native American history, culture, and perspectives into the curriculum to help students connect with their identity and feel more invested in their education.
7. Family engagement: Engage with Native American families through regular communication, events, and workshops that promote cultural understanding and support academic success.
8. Academic supports: Provide academic supports, such as tutoring, study groups, or academic mentorship programs, to help Native American students succeed in school.
9. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address the unique needs of Native American students, such as language preservation programs, cultural competency training for educators, or increased funding for Native American-serving schools.
10. Community outreach: Collaborate with local Native American communities to raise awareness about the educational success of recent immigrant students and promote inclusive practices in education.
