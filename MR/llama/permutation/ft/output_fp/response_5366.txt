There are several challenges that native Arabic speakers and native English speakers may face in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For native Arabic speakers who are not fluent in English, navigating the legal system in an English-speaking country can be difficult due to language barriers. Similarly, for native English speakers who are not familiar with Arabic, they may struggle to understand legal terminology and concepts.
2. Cultural differences: Legal systems and cultures can vary significantly between countries, and even within the same country. Native Arabic speakers may find that their cultural background and values are not always aligned with the legal system they are interacting with, while native English speakers may struggle to understand the nuances of a non-Anglophone legal system.
