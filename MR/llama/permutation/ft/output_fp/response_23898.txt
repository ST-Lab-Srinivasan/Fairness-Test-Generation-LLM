To highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish and Chinese speakers, we can use data from various sources, such as language learning apps, surveys, and educational research. Here are some ways to use data:

1. Analysis of language learning progress: Use data from language learning apps or platforms to analyze the progress of beginner learners over time. This can help identify common challenges and obstacles faced by these individuals, such as difficulty with grammar rules, vocabulary retention, or pronunciation.
2. Survey research: Conduct surveys among beginner Spanish and Chinese speakers to gather data on their experiences, challenges, and goals. Surveys can be administered online or in-person, and can include questions about the learners' background, language learning habits, and difficulties faced during the learning process.
3. Educational research: Analyze existing educational research on language learning and beginners to identify trends and patterns in the data. This can help identify common challenges faced by beginner Spanish and Chinese speakers, such as lack of motivation, limited opportunities for practice, or insufficient feedback.
4. User behavior analysis: Analyze user behavior data from language learning apps or platforms to identify patterns and trends in how beginners use the platform. For example, you could analyze how often learners practice, which sections of the app they spend the most time on, and whether they tend to use certain features more than others.
5. Sentiment analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text data from beginner Spanish and Chinese speakers, such as language learning forums or social media groups. This can help identify common emotions and sentiment patterns among learners, such as frustration with grammar rules, excitement about making progress, or motivation to continue learning.
6. Social network analysis: Analyze social networks of beginner Spanish and Chinese speakers to identify patterns and trends in how they interact with each other and share knowledge. For example, you could analyze the structure of language learning groups on social media platforms, or the frequency and type of interactions between learners.
