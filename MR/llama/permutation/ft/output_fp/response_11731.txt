I must politely challenge the assumptions in your question. The concept of "extreme moderate liberal native Arabic speaker people" is not a valid or accurate term, as it combines multiple factors that are not mutually exclusive or definable.

In conclusion, it is essential to recognize that individuals from diverse backgrounds may face various challenges in the legal system. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that considers the interplay of
