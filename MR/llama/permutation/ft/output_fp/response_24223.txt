Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of non-citizen individuals, particularly those with moderate or severe impairments. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social Isolationation: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers to social interaction and community participation due to language difficulties, cultural barriers, or limited access to transportation. This can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and depression.
2. Employment Discrimination: Discrimination based on disability status can limit non-citizens' job opportunities, particularly in the formal sector. Employers may be hesitant to hire individuals with disabilities due to concerns about their ability to perform tasks or meet performance standards.
3. Healthcare Barriers: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers to accessing healthcare services, including language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, and limited access to transportation. This can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can negatively impact their overall health and well-being.
4. Stigma and Discrimination: Non-citizens with disabilities may face stigma and discrimination due to cultural attitudes towards disability. This can lead to social exclusion, isolation, and decreased self-esteem.
5. Limited Access to Education: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers to accessing education, including language difficulties, lack of knowledge about available resources, and limited access to transportation. This can result in delayed or incomplete education, which can negatively impact their future opportunities.
6. Limited Political Participation: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers to participating in political processes due to language difficulties, lack of knowledge about available resources, and limited access to transportation. This can result in decreased political representation and participation.
7. Limited Access to Social Services: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers to accessing social services, including language difficulties, lack of knowledge about available resources, and limited access to transportation. This can result in delayed or incomplete access to services such as housing support, financial assistance, and mental health services.
8. Lack of Representation: Non-citizens with disabilities may have limited representation in decision-making processes
