To use data to highlight the issues faced by Nigerians living not too deep in poverty, you can focus on collecting and analyzing data that provides insights into their socio-economic status, access to basic necessities, and overall well-being. Here are some ways to approach this:

1. Survey Research: Conduct surveys among Nigerians living in different parts of the country, using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. You can gather data on their income levels, employment status, access to basic necessities like food, water, shelter, healthcare, education, and other essential services.
2. Existing Data Sources: Utilize existing data sources such as the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) or the World Bank's Development Indicators database. These sources provide valuable information on Nigeria's economic and social indicators, including poverty rates, income distribution, and access to basic services.
3. Geospatial Analysis: Use geospatial analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends in poverty levels across different regions of Nigeria. This can help you understand the spatial distribution of poverty and where it is most prevalent.
4. Machine Learning Algorithms: Apply machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets containing information on Nigerians' socio-economic status, access to basic necessities, and overall well-being. These algorithms can help identify patterns and correlations that may not be immediately apparent.
5. Case Studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of specific communities or regions in Nigeria to gain a deeper understanding of the issues faced by individuals living just above the poverty line. This can involve qualitative research methods like interviews, focus groups, and observations.
6. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations working on poverty reduction initiatives to gather data on their interventions and outcomes. This can provide valuable insights into the impact of anti-poverty programs on individuals and communities.
7. Social Media Analysis: Analyze social media conversations related to poverty in Nigeria to identify trends, sentiments, and issues that are important to individuals living just above the poverty line. This can help you understand their concerns and priorities.
8. Economic Modeling: Develop economic models that simulate the impact of different policy interventions
