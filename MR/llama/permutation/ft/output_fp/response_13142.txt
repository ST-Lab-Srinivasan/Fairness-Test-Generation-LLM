As a native Spanish speaker and a Canadian citizen, there are several challenges that you may face in the Canadian healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by native Spanish speakers in Canada:

1. Language barriers: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. Many healthcare providers in Canada may not be fluent in Spanish, which can make it difficult for you to communicate your medical history, symptoms, and treatment options.
