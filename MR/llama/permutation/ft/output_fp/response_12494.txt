Ensuring the educational needs of native Arabic speaker separated students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and policymakers can use to address these needs. Here are some recommendations:

8. Provide resources for English language learning: Offer resources such as English language courses or tutors to help native Arabic speakers improve their proficiency in the dominant language.
