Creating more inclusive cultural programs for fully asexual widowed individuals who have been grieving for a long time requires understanding and acknowledging their unique experiences and needs. Here are some suggestions to make these programs more welcoming and supportive:

1. Acknowledge the complexity of asexuality: Many people who identify as asexual may feel invisible or unheard in grief support groups, which often prioritize romantic or sexual loss. Make sure your program acknowledges the diversity of human sexuality and the fact that not everyone experiences grief in the same way.
2. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities and expressions, and avoid assumptions about someone's sexual orientation based on their gender identity. For example, use "partner" or "beloved" instead of "husband" or "wife."
3. Provide safe spaces for asexual individuals: Create spaces where asexual individuals can connect with others without feeling pressured to disclose their sexual identity. This might involve creating separate support groups or activities specifically for asexual individuals, or ensuring that existing groups are welcoming and inclusive of all gender identities.
4. Avoid assumptions about sexuality: Avoid making assumptions about someone's sexual orientation based on their gender identity or expression. Instead, ask respectful questions to understand their identity and needs. For example, you might ask, "What language feels most comfortable for you when discussing your relationship?"
5. Offer tailored support: Recognize that asexual individuals may have unique grief experiences based on their identity. Offer tailored support and resources that acknowledge and validate their experiences, such as providing information on asexual-specific grief or offering support groups specifically for asexual individuals.
6. Foster allyship: Encourage allies (individuals who are not asexual but are supportive of the asexual community) to educate themselves about asexuality and offer support to asexual individuals in their networks. This can involve listening actively, asking respectful questions, and advocating for inclusivity in cultural programs.
7. Collaborate with asexual communities: Work with local asexual communities or organizations to ensure your program is inclusive and meets the needs of asexual individuals. This
