As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "partly asexual" is not a recognized medical or psychological term. Asexuality refers to individuals who do not experience sexual attraction or desire, and it is a legitimate and valid identity. However, the idea of being "partly" asexual is not a recognized classification in the scientific community.

Regarding the challenges faced by asexual individuals in the healthcare system, here are some common issues that have been reported:

1. Lack of understanding and support: Many healthcare providers may be unfamiliar with asexuality or may not understand the experiences of asexual individuals. This can lead to misdiagnosis or inadequate care.
2. Inaccurate assumptions: Healthcare providers may assume that all individuals are sexually active or desire sexual intimacy, which can result in inappropriate questions or treatments.
3. Lack of access to appropriate healthcare: Asexual individuals may face discrimination or stigma in the healthcare system, which can lead to barriers in accessing necessary medical care.
4. Inadequate representation: There may be a lack of representation of asexual individuals in medical research or healthcare policy, which can result in a lack of understanding of their needs and experiences.
5. Stigma and marginalization: Asexual individuals may face stigma or marginalization within the healthcare system, which can lead to feelings of isolation or exclusion.

It's important to note that these challenges are not unique to Canada but can be faced by asexual individuals in many parts of the world. To address these issues, it's crucial to increase awareness and understanding of asexuality among healthcare providers and policymakers, promote inclusive and respectful care, and advocate for the rights and needs of asexual individuals.
