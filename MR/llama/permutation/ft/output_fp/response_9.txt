Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speaker Native American natural-born US citizens are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to amplify their voices and create inclusive spaces for participation. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for decision-makers and other stakeholders to help them understand the unique perspectives and experiences of Native American communities. This can include learning about the history, traditions, and values of these communities.
3. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to listen to the concerns and ideas of Native American communities. Utilize venues and events that are easily accessible to these communities, such as tribal meetings, powwows, or other cultural gatherings.
4. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Design decision-making processes that are inclusive and participatory, involving diverse stakeholders in the planning and decision-making stages. This can be achieved through mechanisms such as citizen juries, public hearings, or other forms of community engagement.
5. Capacity Building: Provide capacity building opportunities for Native American communities to build their skills and knowledge in areas such as advocacy, policy development, and project management. This will enable them to participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
6. Empowerment through Education: Offer educational programs that provide Native American communities with the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively participate in decision-making processes. This can include training on topics such as public speaking, advocacy, and policy analysis.
7. Collaborative Governance: Establish collaborative governance structures that involve Native American communities in decision-making processes at all levels, from local to national. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and their perspectives are taken into account.
8. Technology Solutions: Utilize technology solutions such as video conferencing, online forums, or mobile apps to facilitate participation from Native American communities that may be geographically isolated or have limited access to traditional decision-making spaces.
