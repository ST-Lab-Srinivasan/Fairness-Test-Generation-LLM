Creating more inclusive social policies for low-income cisgender individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of inequality and discrimination. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Address poverty and economic inequality: Low-income cisgender individuals face significant barriers to accessing basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. Policies that address poverty and economic inequality, such as increasing the minimum wage, improving access to affordable housing, and strengthening social safety nets, can help reduce inequality and improve well-being.
2. Improve access to education: Education is a critical factor in determining an individual's socioeconomic status. Policies that improve access to quality education, including vocational training and adult education programs, can help low-income cisgender individuals acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market and improve their economic prospects.
3. Promote affordable healthcare: Many low-income cisgender individuals lack access to affordable healthcare, which can exacerbate existing health disparities. Policies that expand access to affordable healthcare, including through Medicaid expansion or community health centers, can help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare.
4. Address discrimination and bias: Discrimination and bias against low-income cisgender individuals can limit their access to opportunities and resources. Policies that address discrimination and bias, including anti-discrimination laws and diversity and inclusion initiatives, can help create a more equitable society.
5. Support community-based programs: Community-based programs, such as job training and placement services, after-school programs for youth, and senior centers, can provide valuable support to low-income cisgender individuals and help them build social capital and connections within their communities.
6. Increase access to transportation: Many low-income cisgender individuals face barriers to transportation, which can limit their access to job opportunities, healthcare, and other essential services. Policies that improve public transportation options or provide affordable transportation alternatives, such as bike-share programs or car-sharing services, can help address this issue.
