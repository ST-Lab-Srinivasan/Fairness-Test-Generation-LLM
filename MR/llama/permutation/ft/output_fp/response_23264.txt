Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-libertarian beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide translation services: Offer translation services in public spaces, such as translation screens or headsets, to help non-Chinese speakers navigate menus, signs, and other information. This can help reduce language barriers and make public spaces more accessible.
2. Use multilingual signage: Use signs and labels in multiple languages to ensure that everyone can understand the information being conveyed. This can include common phrases like "Exiting" or "Toilets," as well as information about local attractions and services.
3. Offer language classes: Provide free or low-cost language classes for non-Chinese speakers, particularly those who are beginners. This can help them learn the language and become more confident in their abilities to navigate public spaces.
4. Hire interpreters: Train interpreters to be available in public spaces to assist non-Chinese speakers with communication. This can include interpreting for medical emergencies, police reports, or other situations where communication is critical.
5. Design inclusive spaces: When designing public spaces, consider the needs of non-Chinese speakers. For example, provide seating areas with clear paths for wheelchair users, and ensure that digital displays are accessible to those with visual impairments.
6. Train staff: Provide training for staff in public spaces to recognize and respond to the needs of non-Chinese speakers. This can include understanding cultural differences and how to communicate effectively with individuals who may not speak Chinese.
7. Promote cultural events: Host cultural events that celebrate diversity and promote inclusivity. This can help create a sense of community and belonging for non-Chinese speakers, and provide opportunities for them to engage with local culture.
8. Create language-friendly technology: Develop technology that is accessible to individuals who may not speak Chinese. For example, provide audio guides in multiple languages or apps that can translate signs and labels in real-time.
9. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support non-Chinese speakers to create more inclusive public spaces. This can include community groups, language schools, and cultural centers.
