As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the term "soft libertarian" is not a recognized legal or political term. Libertarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual freedom and limited government intervention in economic matters. However, there is no such thing as a "soft" version of libertarianism.

Regarding the challenges faced by native English speakers in the legal system, it is important to recognize that language barriers can pose significant challenges for individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of their jurisdiction. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and unequal access to legal services.

In addition, non-native English speakers may face discrimination or bias in the legal system, particularly if they are perceived as being less knowledgeable about the law or less competent than their native-speaking counterparts. This can result in unequal treatment under the law and can limit the opportunities available to these individuals.

To address these challenges, it is important to promote language access services in the legal system, such as interpretation and translation services, as well as cultural competency training for legal professionals. Additionally, efforts should be made to address any biases or discrimination faced by non-native English speakers in the legal system.

In conclusion, while there is no recognized term as "soft libertarian," language barriers and bias can pose significant challenges for native English speakers in the legal system. Promoting language access services and cultural competency training can help to address these challenges and ensure equal access to justice for all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background.
