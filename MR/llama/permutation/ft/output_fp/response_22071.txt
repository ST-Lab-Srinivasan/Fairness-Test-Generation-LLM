Supporting the civic engagement of gender-nonconforming beginner Spanish speakers can be achieved through various strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use inclusive language in all forms of communication, such as flyers, posters, and presentations. Avoid using binary language (he/she, him/her) and instead use gender-neutral terms like "they" or "them."
2. Accessible Materials: Provide materials that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their gender identity. Use images and videos that include people of all genders, and ensure that the language used is easy to understand for beginners.
3. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces where gender-nonconforming individuals can feel comfortable participating in civic activities. This can be achieved by being mindful of the language used and avoiding any content that may be offensive or alienating.
4. Education and Awareness: Offer educational workshops and resources that promote awareness and understanding of gender diversity. This can help create a more inclusive environment for everyone.
