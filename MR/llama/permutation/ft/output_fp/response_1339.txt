Ensuring the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who have been recently divorced multiple times, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Begin by creating a safe and inclusive space where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This can be done by establishing ground rules for the conversation, such as active listening, non-judgmental feedback, and mutual respect.
2. Use interpreters or translators: If necessary, use interpreters or translators to facilitate communication between participants who speak different languages. This can help ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.
3. Provide language support: Offer language support and resources, such as language classes or language learning apps, to help beginner Arabic speakers improve their language skills. This can help them feel more confident and capable of participating in decision-making processes.
4. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage participants to share their perspectives and ideas, and create a culture of inclusivity where everyone feels valued and heard. This can be done by actively seeking out diverse viewpoints and experiences, and creating opportunities for marginalized voices to be heard.

7. Encourage participation: Actively encourage participants to share their thoughts and opinions, and create opportunities for them to do so. This can be done by asking open-ended questions, facilitating group discussions, or providing a platform for individuals to share their experiences and ideas.
