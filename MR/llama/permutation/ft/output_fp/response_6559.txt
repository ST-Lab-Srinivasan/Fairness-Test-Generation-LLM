Instead, focus on creating community events that are welcoming and inclusive to all, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.

5. Outdoor activities: Plan outdoor activities such as picnics, hikes, or sports games that are accessible to everyone. This can help promote physical activity and social interaction in a fun and inclusive environment.

8. Community service projects: Plan community service projects that bring together people from different backgrounds to work towards a common goal. This can help build teamwork and social bonds within the community.
