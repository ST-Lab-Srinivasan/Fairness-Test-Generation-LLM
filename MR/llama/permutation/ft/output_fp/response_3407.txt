Creating more inclusive social policies for partnered temporary visa holder individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these individuals. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognize partnerships: Temporary visa holders often face difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships due to their immigration status. Governments should recognize and respect the validity of partnerships between temporary visa holders and their Australian partners. This can be achieved by recognizing the partnership in government forms, applications, and documentation.

Promote integration: Governments should work to promote social integration by providing opportunities for temporary visa holders to participate in community activities, volunteer work, and language classes. This can help build connections between temporary visa holders and the wider Australian community.
5. Address discrimination: Temporary visa holders often face discrimination due to their immigration status. Governments should work to address discrimination by providing education and awareness campaigns that promote cultural diversity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

8. Improve access to education: Temporary visa holders often face barriers when trying to access education
