Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of young adults, particularly those who identify as moderate liberals. Here are some ways mentorship can influence their growth and development:

1. Ideological guidance: Moderate liberals often find themselves caught between the polarizing extremes of liberal and conservative ideologies. A mentor can provide guidance on how to navigate these complex issues, helping mentees understand the nuances of moderate liberalism and how to apply it in their personal and professional lives.
