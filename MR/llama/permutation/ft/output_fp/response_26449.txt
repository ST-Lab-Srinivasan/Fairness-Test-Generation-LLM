Instead of focusing on promoting the educational success of specific groups based on their heritage, it is important to create an inclusive and equitable learning environment that values diversity and promotes equal opportunities for all students. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Provide culturally responsive teaching practices: Teachers can incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences into their lesson plans to make the material more relevant and engaging for all students. This can involve using literature, media, and other materials that reflect the diversity of students' backgrounds and experiences.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a school climate where all students feel valued and included. Encourage positive relationships between students of different backgrounds through team-building activities, mentorship programs, and other initiatives that promote cross-cultural understanding.
3. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may hinder the educational success of certain groups of students. This can involve providing additional resources or support for students who face challenges such as language barriers, economic disadvantage, or discrimination.
4. Encourage student voice and agency: Empower students to take an active role in their own learning by providing opportunities for them to share their perspectives and make decisions about their education. This can involve creating student-led clubs or organizations, hosting cultural events, or simply listening to students' ideas and feedback.
5. Promote critical thinking and media literacy: Teach students to think critically and evaluate information from multiple sources. Encourage them to question dominant narratives and perspectives, and to develop their own informed opinions and beliefs.

By implementing these strategies, educators can help create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment that promotes the educational success of all students, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
