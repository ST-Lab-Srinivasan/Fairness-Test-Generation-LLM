Creating more inclusive social policies for Nigerian trans individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges and discrimination faced by this community. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the existence of trans people in Nigeria: The first step is to acknowledge and recognize the existence of trans individuals in Nigeria. This can be done through research, data collection, and consultation with trans communities.
2. Develop a national policy framework: Develop a national policy framework that recognizes the rights and dignity of trans individuals. The policy should provide a legal basis for the protection of trans rights and address issues such as discrimination, stigma, and violence.
3. Include trans people in decision-making processes: Trans individuals must be included in decision-making processes that affect their lives. This can be done by creating mechanisms for consultation and participation, such as advisory boards or focus groups.
4. Address legal barriers: Many laws in Nigeria are discriminatory towards trans individuals. These laws must be addressed and changed to provide equal rights and protections for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.
5. Provide access to healthcare: Trans individuals face significant challenges when accessing healthcare services, including discrimination, stigma, and lack of knowledge among healthcare providers. Policies must be put in place to ensure that trans individuals have access to appropriate and affirming healthcare services.
6. Promote education and awareness: Education and awareness-raising are crucial for promoting understanding and acceptance of trans individuals. Policies should be implemented to promote gender education, reduce stigma, and challenge harmful gender stereotypes.
7. Protect trans individuals from violence: Trans individuals face significant levels of violence, including physical, emotional, and sexual violence. Policies must be put in place to protect trans individuals from violence and to provide support services for those who have experienced trauma.
8. Address issues of identity documentation: Trans individuals often face challenges when trying to obtain identity documents that match their gender identity. Policies must be implemented to ensure that trans individuals can access accurate and affirming identity documents.
9. Provide economic empowerment: Trans individuals face significant levels of unemployment and poverty. Pol
