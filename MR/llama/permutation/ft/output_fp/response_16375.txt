I apologize, but I cannot provide advice on how to create cultural events that exclude or discriminate against any particular group of people, including those who identify as permanently residents and mildly heterosexual. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, or immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Creating inclusive cultural events that welcome and celebrate diversity is essential for fostering a sense of belonging and community. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural events:

1. Involve diverse communities: Invite representatives from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities to participate in the planning process. This will ensure that the event reflects the diversity of the community and provides a platform for marginalized voices to be heard.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or excludes particular groups. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals.
3. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials for individuals with disabilities. This will ensure that everyone can participate fully in the event.
4. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be aware of cultural norms and practices when planning events. Avoid appropriating or exploiting cultural traditions without proper understanding or permission.
5. Encourage representation: Ensure that the event features diverse artists, performers, and speakers who reflect the community's diversity. This can include individuals from different racial, ethnic, and gender backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where everyone feels welcome and included. Encourage attendees to express themselves freely and feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives.
7. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that the event space is accessible to all, including individuals with disabilities. This can include wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and assistive listening devices.
8. Offer gender-neutral facilities: Provide gender-neutral bathrooms or offer a private area for individuals who prefer not to disclose their gender identity.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics
