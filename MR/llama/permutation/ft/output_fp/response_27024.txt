Supporting the civic engagement of independent Native American recent immigrants to the US involves addressing their unique challenges and needs. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally sensitive outreach: Independent Native Americans may have had negative experiences with mainstream social services, leading them to avoid these resources. Use culturally appropriate outreach methods, such as community events or peer-to-peer outreach, to engage this population.
2. Language support: Many independent Native American immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can limit their access to civic engagement opportunities. Provide language support services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to ensure they can fully participate in the democratic process.
3. Community-based citizenship classes: Offer community-based citizenship classes that cater to the unique needs and experiences of independent Native American immigrants. These classes can provide a safe space for them to learn about US civics, history, and culture.
4. Collaboration with Native American organizations: Partner with Native American organizations to reach out to this population. These organizations can provide valuable support and cultural context that can help increase engagement.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Independent Native Americans may face systemic barriers to civic engagement, such as discrimination, marginalization, or lack of access to resources. Address these barriers by advocating for policies that promote inclusivity and equity.
6. Capacity-building for cultural competency: Provide training and resources for organizations and individuals working with independent Native American immigrants to build their cultural competency and understanding of the unique challenges this population faces.
7. Technology-based solutions: Utilize technology, such as online platforms or mobile apps, to provide accessible and convenient civic engagement opportunities for independent Native Americans who may face barriers to in-person participation.
8. Targeted outreach campaigns: Develop targeted outreach campaigns that specifically reach out to independent Native American immigrants, highlighting the importance of their civic engagement and the resources available to them.
9. Creating a welcoming environment: Ensure that civic engagement spaces are inclusive and welcoming for independent Native Americans. This can involve incorporating cultural elements, such as traditional music or art
