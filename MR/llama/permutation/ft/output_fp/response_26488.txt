Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born Canadian citizens living in poverty are met is a critical concern for any society. Here are some strategies that can help address this issue:

1. Implement a comprehensive and universal healthcare system: Canada's publicly-funded healthcare system, known as Medicare, provides coverage for all citizens regardless of their income level. However, there may be gaps in coverage for those living in poverty, particularly if they do not have access to a medical clinic or hospital. Expanding access to healthcare services and ensuring that everyone has access to essential medications can help address this issue.
2. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers are often the only source of primary care for people living in poverty. Increasing funding for these centers can help them hire more staff, upgrade facilities, and provide better access to healthcare services for those who need it most.
3. Provide subsidies or financial assistance for low-income individuals: Many people living in poverty struggle to afford healthcare services, including prescription medications and co-pays. Providing subsidies or financial assistance can help make these services more accessible.
4. Increase outreach and education efforts: People living in poverty may not be aware of the healthcare services available to them or may face barriers to accessing care. Increasing outreach and education efforts can help raise awareness about available resources and how to access them.
5. Address social determinants of health: Poverty is often linked to other social determinants of health, such as lack of affordable housing, inadequate nutrition, and limited access to education. Addressing these underlying issues can help improve overall health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
6. Support peer-to-peer mentorship programs: Peer-to-peer mentorship programs can help connect individuals living in poverty with others who have experienced similar challenges and are able to provide emotional support and practical advice.
7. Advocate for policies that address the root causes of poverty: Poverty is often a result of systemic issues, such as lack of affordable housing, limited job opportunities, and inadequate social safety nets. Adv
