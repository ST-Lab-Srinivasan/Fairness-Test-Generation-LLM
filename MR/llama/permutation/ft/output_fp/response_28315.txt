Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner English speakers who are not recently divorced individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Identify the needs of the target group: Understand the specific needs and challenges faced by beginner English speakers in your community, including their language learning goals, cultural backgrounds, and any barriers they may face in accessing language resources.
2. Offer flexible scheduling options: Provide flexible scheduling options to accommodate different learning styles and schedules. For example, offer classes during the day, evening, or weekends to cater to individuals who have busy work schedules or family responsibilities.
3. Use inclusive language materials: Develop language learning materials that reflect the diversity of your community, including materials that cater to different cultures, genders, and ages. Avoid using materials that are too focused on specific cultural or linguistic groups, as this can create a sense of exclusion for individuals who do not identify with those groups.
4. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Create opportunities for beginner English speakers to learn from each other through peer-to-peer learning activities. This can help build a sense of community and inclusivity, as well as provide opportunities for individuals to share their own language learning experiences and cultural practices.
5. Provide supportive environment: Create a supportive and welcoming environment for beginner English speakers, free from judgment or criticism. Encourage individuals to ask questions, make mistakes, and learn from each other without fear of embarrassment or failure.
6. Offer additional resources: Provide access to additional resources such as language learning apps, podcasts, and online courses that cater to different learning styles and preferences. This can help supplement classroom learning and provide individuals with additional opportunities to practice their English skills outside of the classroom.
7. Encourage collaboration: Encourage beginner English speakers to collaborate on language learning projects, such as creating a group presentation or organizing a cultural event. This can help build teamwork and communication skills, while also providing opportunities for individuals to learn from each other and share their language learning experiences.
8. Provide feedback and encouragement: Offer regular feedback and encouragement to beginner English speakers, highlighting their progress and achievements.
