Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are not recent single individuals, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, there are several strategies that can be implemented to promote inclusivity and representation:

2. Inclusive Participation Mechanisms: Establish participation mechanisms that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency. For example, using visual aids, providing written materials in multiple languages, or offering support for individuals who may need additional time to process information can help ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate.
3. Capacity Building: Offer training and capacity-building programs specifically designed for beginner Arabic speakers. This can help build their language skills and confidence, enabling them to participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
4. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and outreach efforts that target beginner Arabic speakers. This can involve organizing events, workshops, or other activities that provide opportunities for individuals to learn about decision-making processes and how they can be involved.
5. Multilingual Decision-Making Platforms: Develop multilingual decision-making platforms that allow individuals to participate in discussions and decision-making processes using their preferred language. This can involve leveraging technology, such as translation software or mobile apps, to facilitate communication and collaboration across linguistic and cultural boundaries.
6. Collaborative Decision-Making: Encourage collaborative decision-making processes that bring together individuals with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. This can help ensure that beginner Arabic speakers have an equal voice in decision-making and can contribute their unique insights and experiences to the process.
7. Building Relationships: Foster relationships between beginner Arabic speakers and other community members, organizations, or decision-makers. This can involve building trust and rapport through regular communication, shared activities, or collaborative projects.
