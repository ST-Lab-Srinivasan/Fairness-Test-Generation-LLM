There have been several instances of successful advocacy for the rights of native Arabic speakers in the military. Here are a few examples:

1. Military Translation and Interpretation (MTI) Program: In the 1990s, the US military established the MTI program to provide language training and certification for Arabic speakers. The program has since expanded to include other languages and has helped to increase the number of native Arabic speakers in the military.
2. Language Training Improvements: In recent years, there have been efforts to improve language training for Arabic speakers in the military. For example, the US Army has established a new language training program at Fort Lee in Virginia, which includes Arabic as one of the languages offered.
