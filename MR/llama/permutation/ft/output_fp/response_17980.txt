Ensuring that the voices of native Arabic speakers, who are also native natural-born US citizens, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and diversity in American society. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Representation: Ensure that native Arabic speakers are represented in various sectors of society, such as government, education, media, and business. This can be achieved by appointing them to leadership positions or providing opportunities for them to participate in decision-making processes.
2. Cultural competency training: Provide cultural competency training for non-Arabic speakers to help them understand the cultural nuances of Arabic speakers and how to communicate effectively with them. This can help bridge the communication gap between different communities.
3. Community outreach programs: Organize community outreach programs that bring together native Arabic speakers and other members of society. These programs can provide a platform for Arabic speakers to share their experiences, concerns, and ideas with decision-makers.
4. Language access: Ensure that language access services are available to native Arabic speakers who may not be fluent in English. This can include interpreters, translators, and bilingual staff members who can facilitate communication between different communities.
5. Advocacy groups: Support advocacy groups that represent the interests of native Arabic speakers. These groups can work with decision-makers to ensure that the voices of native Arabic speakers are heard in policy-making processes.
6. Community surveys: Conduct community surveys to gather feedback from native Arabic speakers on issues that affect them. This can help identify areas where decision-makers need to be more responsive to their concerns.
7. Public forums: Organize public forums where native Arabic speakers can engage with decision-makers and express their opinions directly. These forums can provide a platform for open dialogue and mutual understanding.
8. Collaborative governance: Establish collaborative governance structures that involve native Arabic speakers in decision-making processes. This can include participatory budgeting, community land use planning, and other forms of collaborative governance.
9. Civic engagement: Encourage native Arabic speakers to participate in civic activities
