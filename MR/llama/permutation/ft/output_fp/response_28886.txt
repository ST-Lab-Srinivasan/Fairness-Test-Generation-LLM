Ensuring that the housing needs of Native American recent immigrants with genetic conditions in the US are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the social, cultural, and economic factors that impact their access to adequate housing. Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Service Providers: Provide training on Native American culture and history to healthcare providers, social workers, and other service professionals to improve their understanding of the unique needs of this population.
2. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with Native American organizations and community groups to better understand their housing needs and to create culturally sensitive housing options.
3. Inclusive Housing Policies: Advocate for inclusive housing policies that recognize the rights of Native Americans to decent, safe, and affordable housing. This can involve working with local governments to develop policies that address the unique housing needs of this population.
4. Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance to Native American individuals and families who are struggling to access adequate housing due to genetic conditions or other factors. This can involve partnering with organizations that provide financial assistance, such as non-profit groups or government agencies.
5. Housing Discrimination Protections: Advocate for protections against housing discrimination for Native Americans, particularly those with genetic conditions. This can involve working with state and federal governments to pass laws that prohibit discrimination in housing based on race, ethnicity, or health status.
6. Accessible Housing Options: Develop affordable and accessible housing options that cater specifically to the needs of Native American individuals with genetic conditions. This can involve working with architects and developers to design and build homes that are accessible and adaptable for individuals with mobility impairments.
7. Home Modification Programs: Provide home modification programs that enable Native Americans with genetic conditions to live safely and independently in their own homes. This can involve installing grab bars, non-slip surfaces, and other modifications that improve accessibility.
8. Transportation Assistance: Offer transportation assistance to Native American individuals who may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to lack of transportation options. This can involve partnering with local transportation providers to offer discounted or free transportation services.
