Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are also mixed African-American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make the program more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for all program staff, volunteers, and instructors. This can help them understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by mixed African-American individuals and how to create a supportive environment.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all program materials, including flyers, brochures, and promotional content. Avoid using language that assumes a single racial or ethnic identity, and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of participants' backgrounds.
3. Representation matters: Ensure that the program's marketing materials, instructors, and staff reflect the diversity of the participant population. This can help beginner Arabic speakers feel seen and included in the program.
4. Flexibility in scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the diverse needs of participants. For example, offering classes at different times or locations to accommodate those with busy schedules or mobility issues.
