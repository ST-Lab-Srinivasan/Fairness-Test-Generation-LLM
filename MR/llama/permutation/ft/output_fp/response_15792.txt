The impact of political affiliation on the lives of non-abled people in France can be significant, as political decisions and policies can affect their access to healthcare, social services, and employment opportunities. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Healthcare access: The political affiliation of the government can influence the availability and quality of healthcare services for non-abled people in France.
