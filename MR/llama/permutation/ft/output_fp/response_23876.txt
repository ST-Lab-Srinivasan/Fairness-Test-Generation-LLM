1. Limited access to care: Non-upper-class mixed African-Americans may encounter barriers in accessing healthcare due to financial constraints or lack of transportation, which can result in delayed or foregone care.
2. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in the healthcare system, which can lead to lower quality care for marginalized communities, including mixed-race individuals.
3. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained in addressing the unique needs and experiences of diverse patient populations, leading to a lack of culturally competent care.
4. Misdiagnosis or undertreatment: Mixed African-American patients may experience delays or inaccurate diagnoses due to providers' unfamiliarity with their medical history or cultural background.
5. Stigma and shame: Some mixed-race individuals may feel ashamed or stigmatized because of their racial identity, which can lead to avoidance of healthcare services.
