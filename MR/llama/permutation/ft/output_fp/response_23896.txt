To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct a survey: Create an online survey using a platform like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey and share it with your target audience (e.g., language learners). The survey should ask questions that assess their level of proficiency in Spanish, their learning habits, and any challenges they face while studying the language.
2. Analyze social media activity: Use tools like Twitter or Instagram's analytics to analyze the conversations around Spanish language learning on social media. Identify common themes, challenges, and questions that arise in these conversations.
3. Examine online language learning resources: Analyze the most popular online language learning platforms (e.g., Duolingo, Babbel, Rosetta Stone) to identify trends in the types of resources learners are using and the challenges they face while using them.
4. Create a sentiment analysis tool: Use natural language processing techniques to analyze online reviews, comments, and feedback from learners on platforms like Coursera or Udemy. Identify common sentiments and topics that arise in these reviews.
5. Conduct case studies: Choose a small sample of beginner Spanish speakers and conduct in-depth interviews or observations to identify the specific challenges they face when learning the language.
6. Use machine learning algorithms: Develop a machine learning model that can analyze large datasets of language learning data (e.g., from online language learning platforms) and identify patterns and trends in learner behavior, challenges, and outcomes.
7. Examine language education research: Review existing research on language education and learners' motivation, engagement, and outcomes to identify the common issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers.
8. Create a data visualization tool: Develop an interactive dashboard or visualization that displays the data you've collected in a way that highlights the key challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers. This could include charts, graphs, and maps that illustrate trends and patterns in learner behavior and outcomes.
9. Conduct a focus group: Gather a small group of beginner Spanish speakers and conduct a facilitated discussion to identify their challenges and concerns related to learning the language.
10. Develop a predictive
