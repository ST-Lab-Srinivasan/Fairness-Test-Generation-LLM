Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers, including native recent immigrants to the US, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms or phrases that could be offensive or alienating to any particular group.
2. Cultural Representation: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the immigrant community. This can be achieved by incorporating elements from different cultures, such as music, dance, art, and food.
3. Accessibility: Make sure the programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background. Provide translation services, sign language interpretation, or other accommodations as needed.
4. Community Involvement: Engage with the immigrant community through outreach and partnership efforts. This can help build trust and foster a sense of belonging among participants.
5. Cultural Education: Offer educational components that provide an overview of Chinese culture, history, and customs. This can help participants better understand each other's perspectives and backgrounds.
6. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that encourage participation and collaboration among participants. Examples include group discussions, role-playing exercises, or arts and crafts projects.
7. Safe Space: Create a safe and inclusive space for participants to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or discrimination.
8. Celebration of Diversity: Celebrate the diversity of cultures represented in the program by highlighting each participant's unique background and contributions.
9. Professional Staff: Hire staff who are knowledgeable about Chinese culture and language, as well as sensitive to the needs of immigrant communities. This can help ensure that programs are tailored to meet the specific needs and interests of participants.
10. Continuous Evaluation: Regularly evaluate and assess the effectiveness of cultural programs in promoting inclusivity and understanding among participants. Use this information to make improvements and adjustments as needed.
