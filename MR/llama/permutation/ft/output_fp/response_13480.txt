As a beginning French speaker and an extreme soft libertarian, the impact of military status on your life may be minimal to none. As a libertarian, you likely believe in the individual's right to make their own choices and decisions without interference from the state or any other authority. This belief extends to issues of military service, where you may view conscription or mandatory military service as a violation of personal freedom.

In France, military service is voluntary, and individuals are not required to serve in the military. However, if you were to express your extreme soft libertarian views and refuse to serve in the military, you may face legal consequences. Under French law, failure to comply with military service can result in a fine and/or imprisonment.

However, as a beginner French speaker, you may not be aware of these laws or the cultural attitudes towards military service in France. You may also have limited social interactions and connections in France, which could limit the impact of your beliefs on your daily life.

In terms of practical implications, your extreme soft libertarian views may affect your career choices and lifestyle. As a libertarian, you may be more likely to pursue careers that are non-violent or non-coercive in nature, such as academia, research, or advocacy. Your beliefs may also influence your personal relationships and social interactions, as you may be more selective of the people you associate with and the activities you engage in.

Overall, while military status may have some impact on the life of a beginner French speaker extreme soft libertarian individual, it is unlikely to be significant due to the voluntary nature of military service in France and the individual's personal beliefs and values.
