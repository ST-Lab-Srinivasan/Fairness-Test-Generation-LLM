Creating more inclusive community programs for civilians who are not recently divorced requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Inclusive language and messaging: Use language and messaging that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their marital status. Avoid using terms like "divorce support" or "single support," as these can be alienating for those who are not recently divorced. Instead, use language that emphasizes the importance of community and support for all individuals.
2. Focus on shared experiences: While it's important to acknowledge the unique challenges faced by those who are recently divorced, it's also important to recognize that many people face similar challenges in their daily lives. Create programs that focus on shared experiences and struggles, such as navigating relationships, managing stress, or finding support networks.
3. Build diverse communities: Create programs that bring together individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. This can help to break down barriers and create a sense of belonging for all participants. Encourage diversity in program leadership and participation, as well as in the topics and activities offered.
4. Offer flexible programming options: Recognize that not everyone may be able to participate in traditional group programs. Offer alternative programming options, such as individual coaching or online support groups, to ensure that all individuals have access to support.
5. Address intersectionality: Acknowledge that individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination and marginalization, such as racism, sexism, ableism, and more. Ensure that your programs are inclusive of these intersections and address the unique challenges faced by individuals with multiple marginalized identities.
6. Prioritize self-care: Encourage participants to prioritize self-care and wellness in their program participation. Offer activities and resources that promote relaxation, stress reduction, and overall well-being.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create programs that foster a sense of belonging and connection among participants. This can be achieved through shared activities, social events, or simply creating a safe and welcoming space for all individuals.
8. Provide resources and referrals: Offer resources and referrals to other organizations or services that may be helpful to program participants
