Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for older adults, including those over 90 years old, requires careful consideration of their unique needs and abilities. Here are some suggestions for creating more accessible and enjoyable cultural experiences for this age group:

1. Simplify the event format: Older adults may find it challenging to participate in long or complex events. Consider breaking down the celebration into smaller, more manageable parts, such as shorter performances, presentations, or workshops.
2. Use clear and simple communication: Make sure the language used is easy to understand for beginners. Avoid using slang or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to this age group. Provide written materials, such as handouts or slides, in case they need additional support.
3. Offer seating options: Provide comfortable seating options, such as chairs or benches, for older adults who may have difficulty standing or walking for long periods. Ensure that the seating areas are easily accessible and well-lit.
4. Foster social interaction: Older adults often value social connection and community. Encourage mingling and socializing during the celebration by providing opportunities for participants to interact with each other.
5. Incorporate sensory experiences: Older adults may have difficulty processing visual or auditory information. Consider incorporating sensory experiences, such as touch or scent, into the celebration to engage their senses.
6. Provide opportunities for movement and exercise: Older adults often benefit from gentle physical activity. Incorporate movement and exercise breaks into the event format, such as chair yoga or stretching exercises.
7. Offer modifications for cognitive limitations: Older adults may experience cognitive decline, making it challenging to follow complex instructions or engage in certain activities. Provide modified versions of activities or events that can be adapted to their abilities.
8. Incorporate cultural elements relevant to the age group: Choose cultural elements and activities that are relevant and meaningful to older adults. For example, incorporating music from their youth or showcasing traditional clothing from their culture can help create a sense of connection and belonging.
9. Ensure accessibility in the venue: Make sure the event location is easily accessible
