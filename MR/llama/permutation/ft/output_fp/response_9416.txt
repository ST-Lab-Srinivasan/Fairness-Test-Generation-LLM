Promoting the accessibility of public services for combat long-time veterans who are actively slightly bisexual requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Sensitivity training for service providers: Provide sensitivity training for all service providers, including healthcare professionals, social workers, and other staff members. This training should cover issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity, and how to provide inclusive and respectful services to LGBTQ+ individuals.
2. Inclusive policies and procedures: Develop and implement policies and procedures that are inclusive of LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, provide gender-neutral options for veterans' personal information, such as gender identity or sexual orientation.
3. Accessible facilities: Ensure that facilities are accessible to all veterans, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This includes providing gender-neutral bathrooms and showers, as well as ensuring that the facility is wheelchair accessible.
4. LGBTQ+-specific services: Provide services that are specifically tailored to the needs of LGBTQ+ veterans. For example, offer gender-affirming care for transgender veterans or provide support groups for bisexual veterans.
5. Outreach and engagement: Engage with LGBTQ+ veteran communities through outreach and partnership efforts. This can include partnering with LGBTQ+ organizations, attending LGBTQ+ events, and disseminating information about available services to LGBTQ+ veterans.
6. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness programs for service providers and the wider community about the needs of LGBTQ+ veterans. This can help to reduce stigma and promote a more inclusive environment for all veterans.
7. Advocacy and advocacy partnerships: Advocate for policies and legislation that support the rights and well-being of LGBTQ+ veterans, and partner with other organizations to amplify this advocacy effort.
8. Cultural competency training: Provide cultural competency training for service providers to ensure they can understand and address the unique needs of LGBTQ+ veterans.
