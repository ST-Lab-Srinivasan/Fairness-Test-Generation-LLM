I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to manipulate or "support" individuals based on their race or political affiliations. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their political beliefs or background.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusive and respectful dialogue between people with different viewpoints and experiences. Here are some strategies that can help foster a more inclusive and engaged civic discourse:

1. Listen actively and empathetically: Make an effort to truly hear and understand the perspectives of others, even if you disagree with them. Ask questions and seek clarification on their views.
2. Avoid assumptions and stereotypes: Don't make assumptions about someone's beliefs or values based on their race, political affiliation, or any other characteristic. Instead, ask open-ended questions to learn more about their thoughts and experiences.
3. Foster a culture of mutual respect: Encourage open and respectful dialogue by creating a safe and inclusive space for everyone to share their opinions. Avoid personal attacks or insults, and focus on the issues at hand.
4. Provide opportunities for education and growth: Offer resources and opportunities for people to learn more about different perspectives and issues. This can help broaden their understanding and foster a more informed and engaged citizenship.
5. Encourage critical thinking and media literacy: Help individuals develop critical thinking skills and media literacy by encouraging them to question sources of information, evaluate evidence, and recognize biases or manipulative tactics in media.
6. Promote civic engagement and participation: Encourage people to get involved in their communities and democratic processes. This can involve voting, volunteering, participating in public forums or debates, or advocating for policies that impact their lives.
7. Foster a sense of shared identity and purpose: Help create a sense of belonging and connection among individuals by emphasizing the importance of inclusive decision-making and problem-solving. This can involve recognizing and valuing different perspectives and experiences, while working towards common goals.
8. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Facilitate conversations between people of different ages and backgrounds to promote a more diverse and inclusive
