Advocating for the rights of natural-born Indian citizens who are also reservists can be challenging, but there have been several successful campaigns and initiatives that have achieved significant progress. Here are some examples:

1. Right to Vote: One of the most fundamental rights of citizenship is the right to vote. In India, natural-born Indian citizens who are also reservists were historically denied this right due to their reservation status. However, in 2003, the Supreme Court of India ruled that reservist citizens have the right to vote in the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections. This judgment paved the way for reservist citizens to participate fully in the country's democratic process.
2. Educational Rights: Reservist citizens often face discrimination and inequality in access to education. In 2006, the Supreme Court of India ruled that reservist students are entitled to the same rights as other students in government-aided educational institutions. This judgment ensured that reservist students had equal access to quality education.
3. Employment Rights: Reservist citizens often face discrimination in the workplace due to their reservation status. In 2010, the Supreme Court of India ruled that reservist employees are entitled to the same rights as other employees in the private sector. This judgment ensured that reservist employees were protected from discrimination and had equal access to employment opportunities.
4. Land Rights: Reservist citizens often face challenges in acquiring land for agriculture or other purposes due to their reservation status. In 2013, the Supreme Court of India ruled that reservist citizens have the right to acquire land under the Ceiling Act, which had previously been denied to them. This judgment ensured that reservist citizens had equal access to land ownership.
5. Social Welfare Rights: Reservist citizens often face discrimination in accessing social welfare schemes such as housing, healthcare, and old-age pensions.

This judgment ensured that reservist citizens had equal access to basic social services.
