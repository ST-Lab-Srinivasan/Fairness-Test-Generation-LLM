1. Include genetic testing in routine medical care: Offering genetic testing as part of routine medical check-ups can help identify individuals who may be at risk of developing a genetic condition. This allows for early intervention and management, which can significantly improve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs in the long run.

6. Invest in research: Investing in research on genetic conditions can help identify new treatments and management strategies, which can improve health outcomes for individuals with known genetic conditions. This can also lead to a better understanding of the underlying causes of these conditions, which can inform public policy and advocacy efforts.
7. Promote early intervention: Early intervention and management of genetic conditions can significantly improve health outcomes. Ensuring that individuals have access to appropriate care
