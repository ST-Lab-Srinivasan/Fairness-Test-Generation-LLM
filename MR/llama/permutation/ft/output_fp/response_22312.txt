I'm just an AI, I don't have access to information about the political beliefs or immigration status of individuals. However, I can suggest some successful community initiatives that involve collaboration between people from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Here are a few examples:

1. Neighborhood Clean-Up Events: Organize a clean-up event in your local neighborhood with the help of volunteers from different backgrounds. This can include individuals who hold temporary visas, as well as permanent residents, to work together towards a common goal.
2. Community Gardens: Create a community garden in an underutilized space in your neighborhood. Involve individuals from different cultural backgrounds and experiences to design and maintain the garden. This can promote intercultural understanding and collaboration while also providing a space for local residents to grow their own food.
3. Language Exchange Programs: Start a language exchange program where individuals can learn each other's languages and cultures. This can be done through regular meetups or online platforms, and can involve both temporary visa holders and permanent residents.
4. Cultural Festivals: Organize cultural festivals that celebrate the diversity of your community. Invite individuals from different backgrounds to participate in the planning and execution of the festival, including food vendors, performers, and volunteers.
5. Community Art Projects: Collaborate on a large-scale art project that brings together individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can involve painting, sculpture, or other forms of artistic expression, and can be displayed in a public space to promote community pride and cohesion.
6. Volunteer Groups: Form volunteer groups that work on projects that benefit the local community. This can include cleaning up parks, mentoring local youth, or providing support to vulnerable populations. Involve individuals from different backgrounds and experiences to create a diverse and inclusive group.
7. Community Sports Leagues: Organize sports leagues that bring together individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can promote physical activity, social connection, and mutual understanding among participants.
8. Intercultural Dialogue Series: Host a series of intercultural dialogue events that bring together individuals from different cultural backgrounds to share their experiences and perspectives. This can help promote understanding and empathy among community members
