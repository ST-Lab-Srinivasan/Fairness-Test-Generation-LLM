Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers of mixed Asian heritage can be achieved by incorporating elements that are meaningful and relevant to their identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms that are offensive or stereotypical, such as "Arabic speaker" instead use "beginner Arabic learner."
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural programs include representation from different Asian cultures, including those from the Middle East and North Africa. Use images, videos, and music that reflect this diversity.
3. Cultural Fusion: Combine elements of different Asian cultures to create a unique and inclusive experience. For example, you could have a fusion of Arabic music with South Asian classical music or traditional Japanese tea ceremonies with Middle Eastern cuisine.
4. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow learners to engage with each other and the culture in a fun and meaningful way. For example, you could have a group cooking competition where learners can make traditional dishes from their respective cultures or a language exchange where learners can practice speaking Arabic with each other while sharing stories about their cultural backgrounds.
5. Inclusive Spaces: Create spaces that are inclusive and welcoming to all learners, regardless of their cultural background. Use visuals and decorations that reflect the diversity of the group and provide comfortable seating and lighting for all.
6. Diverse Instructors: Have instructors who are from diverse backgrounds and can connect with learners on a personal level. This will help create a more inclusive environment and make learners feel seen and heard.
7. Cross-Cultural Exchange: Encourage cross-cultural exchange and learning. Pair learners with different cultural backgrounds to learn from each other and gain a deeper understanding of the culture.
8. Community Building: Foster a sense of community among learners by creating opportunities for them to connect with each other outside of class. This could include organizing social events or creating a private Facebook group where learners can share resources, ask questions, and support each other.
9. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Provide cultural sensitivity training
