As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data or statistics on the specific challenges faced by over 90-year-old native Arabic speakers in the legal system. However, I can provide some general information and insights based on available data and research.

1. Language barriers: Older Arabic speakers may face challenges communicating with legal professionals who are not fluent in their language. This could result in misunderstandings or miscommunications that could impact their legal rights and interests.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Many older Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid services, or online legal information. This could make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and exercise their rights.
3. Discrimination and bias: Older Arabic speakers may face discrimination or bias in the legal system due to their age, ethnicity, or language barriers. This could result in unequal treatment under the law and limit their access to justice.
4. Lack of cultural sensitivity: Legal professionals may not be familiar with the cultural practices and values of older Arabic speakers, which could lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of their legal needs and preferences.
5. Difficulty in proving mental capacity: Older Arabic speakers may face challenges proving their mental capacity in legal matters, particularly if they have cognitive or memory impairments. This could result in them being taken advantage of or exploited by unscrupulous individuals or organizations.
6. Limited access to legal representation: Older Arabic speakers may have difficulty finding lawyers who are fluent in their language and familiar with their cultural practices, leading to a lack of legal representation and support.
7. Difficulty in navigating court procedures: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for older adults who may face challenges related to cognitive decline or other disabilities. This could result in them being unable to fully participate in legal proceedings or make informed decisions about their legal rights and interests.
8. Limited access to financial resources: Older Arabic speakers may have limited financial resources, which could impact their ability to afford legal representation or access legal services.
