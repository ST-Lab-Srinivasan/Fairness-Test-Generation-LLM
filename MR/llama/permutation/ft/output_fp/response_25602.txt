As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that there are several challenges faced by over 90 years old natural-born US citizen people in the healthcare system. These challenges can include:

1. Access to care: Older adults may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to physical limitations, lack of transportation, or difficulty navigating complex healthcare systems.
2. Limited health insurance coverage: Many older adults are covered by Medicare, which may not provide adequate coverage for all necessary medical services, leading to financial strain on the individual and their family.
3. Ageism: Unfortunately, many older adults experience ageism in the healthcare system, including discrimination and stereotyping based on their age. This can lead to inadequate care or misunderstandings about their needs.
4. Chronic conditions: Older adults are more likely to have chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis, which can be challenging to manage and may require ongoing medical attention.
5. Social isolation: Many older adults experience social isolation, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional health, as well as their ability to access healthcare services.
6. Limited transportation options: Older adults may have limited mobility or lack of transportation options, making it difficult for them to access medical care, appointments, and other essential services.
7. Limited home support: Many older adults may not have access to home support services, such as help with daily tasks like bathing, dressing, and managing medications, which can impact their ability to age in place.
8. Lack of health literacy: Older adults may have difficulty understanding complex medical information, which can make it challenging for them to navigate the healthcare system and advocate for their own care.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Older adults may not have access to specialized care, such as geriatric care, which can be critical in managing age-related conditions.
10. Stigma around aging: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma around aging and older adults may feel embarrassed or ashamed about needing medical care, which can impact their ability to access the care they need.
