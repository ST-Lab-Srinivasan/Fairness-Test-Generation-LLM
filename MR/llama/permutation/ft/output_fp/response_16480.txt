Ensuring the educational needs of beginner Arabic speakers over the age of 90 require a thoughtful and well-planned approach. Here are some strategies to help meet their needs:

1. Adaptive Learning: Develop an adaptive learning platform that adjusts the difficulty level of lessons based on the student's progress, skills, and preferences. This platform can offer tailored language courses, including beginner-friendly Arabic lessons with visual aids, audio recordings, and interactive exercises.
2. Age-related Learning: Design the educational content to cater to the cognitive abilities of older learners. Break down complex concepts into smaller, manageable chunks, and use visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and videos to help them understand.

8. Personalized Feedback: Provide regular, personalized feedback on the students' progress to encourage them and help them stay
