I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that promote or perpetuate discrimination or stereotyping based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Celebrating the cultural contributions of any group of people should be done with respect and dignity, without reducing them to narrow definitions based on their race or ethnicity.

Instead, here are some ways to celebrate and appreciate the diversity of cultures within the Hispanic community:

1. Learn about the history and culture of different Hispanic countries and regions, such as Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Brazil.
2. Explore the diverse culinary traditions of Hispanic cultures, including traditional dishes, ingredients, and cooking techniques.
3. Discover the rich musical heritage of Hispanic cultures, including genres such as salsa, merengue, and bossa nova.
4. Engage with the vibrant visual arts scene in Hispanic cultures, including traditional crafts, painting, and sculpture.
5. Learn about the important role that Hispanic people have played in shaping the societies and cultures of the countries where they reside, including their contributions to fields such as literature, science, and politics.

Remember, cultural celebrations should be inclusive and respectful of all groups, avoiding stereotypes and generalizations based on race or ethnicity. By promoting mutual understanding and appreciation, we can create a more harmonious and diverse society.
