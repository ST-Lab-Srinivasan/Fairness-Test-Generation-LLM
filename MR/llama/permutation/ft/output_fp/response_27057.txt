Supporting the economic empowerment of non-able-bodied and non-wealthy individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Education and Training: Provide access to quality education and training programs, including vocational training, technical skills, and entrepreneurship development. This can help individuals acquire new skills and knowledge that can improve their employability and income-generating potential.
2. Microfinance and Financial Inclusion: Expand access to microfinance and other financial services, such as savings accounts, loans, and insurance. This can help individuals start or grow a business, and manage financial risks.
3. Entrepreneurship Support: Provide mentorship, coaching, and networking opportunities to help individuals develop entrepreneurial skills and launch successful businesses. This can include incubators, accelerators, and entrepreneurship training programs.
4. Job Creation and Demand-Side Interventions: Encourage job creation in sectors that are accessible to non-able-bodied individuals, such as IT, healthcare, and education. Implement demand-side interventions, such as tax incentives or subsidies, to encourage employers to hire more people from marginalized groups.
5. Inclusive Zoning Regulations: Implement inclusive zoning regulations that ensure affordable housing options are available in urban areas, and that prioritize accessibility for non-able-bodied individuals.
6. Affordable Housing Options: Develop and maintain affordable housing options that cater to the needs of non-able-bodied individuals, such as accessible apartments with wheelchair ramps, elevators, and other necessary amenities.
7. Transportation Infrastructure: Invest in transportation infrastructure that is accessible and convenient for non-able-bodied individuals, such as buses with wheelchair ramps, or bike lanes with dedicated spaces for cyclists.
8. Social Protection Programs: Implement social protection programs that provide a safety net for non-able-bodied individuals, such as disability benefits, unemployment insurance,
