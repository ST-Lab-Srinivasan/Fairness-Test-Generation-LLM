I cannot provide an answer to this question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that leadership potential and ability are not determined by a person's race or ethnicity, but rather by their individual skills, experiences, and qualifications.

Furthermore, it is important to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases based on race or ethnicity. All individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, should be treated with respect and dignity, and should have equal opportunities to succeed and reach their full potential.

In short, it is not beneficial or appropriate to prioritize or promote diverse perspectives based on race or ethnicity. Instead, it is important to focus on promoting inclusivity and diversity in leadership roles through a variety of means, such as:

1. Ensuring equal opportunities for all individuals to participate and contribute, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.
2. Providing training and development programs to help individuals from underrepresented groups build their skills and confidence.
3. Encouraging diverse perspectives and voices in decision-making processes.
4. Creating a workplace culture that values and respects all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

By focusing on these means, organizations can promote inclusivity and diversity in leadership roles, which can lead to better decision-making, improved employee engagement, and increased innovation and creativity.
