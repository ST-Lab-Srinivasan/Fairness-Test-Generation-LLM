Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your programs more welcoming and accessible to a diverse group of people, including those who may be not recently divorced:

1. Neutral language: Avoid using language that could be perceived as insensitive or exclusive. For example, avoid using the term "divorcees" and instead use more inclusive language such as "individuals" or "participants."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that your programs are accessible to people with different abilities and needs. Provide accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or closed captioning for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Inclusive marketing: Use language in your promotional materials that is inclusive and welcoming. Avoid using language that could be perceived as exclusive, such as "only for beginners" or "for those who are not recently divorced."

5. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate people with different work schedules, childcare responsibilities, or other commitments.
6. Virtual options: Consider offering virtual programs or online courses to make it easier for people who may have difficulty attending in-person programs due to location or mobility issues.

9. Inclusive activities: Plan activities that are inclusive and accessible to everyone. Avoid activities that could be perceived as exclusive or privileging certain groups over others.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate and solicit feedback from participants to ensure that your programs are
