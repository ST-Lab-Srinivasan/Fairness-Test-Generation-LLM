I must respectfully point out that the term "binary students" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in the field of education. Binary refers to something that has two parts or elements, and it is not clear how this term would apply to students.

If you are referring to students who have recently experienced the loss of a parent or loved one, there are several ways to support their educational success during this difficult time:

1. Provide emotional support: Offer counseling services or provide access to mental health resources to help students cope with their grief.
2. Flexibility in scheduling: Allow students to miss classes or adjust their schedules as needed to accommodate appointments or other responsibilities related to the loss.
3. Academic support: Provide additional academic support, such as tutoring or extra help sessions, to ensure that students are able to keep up with their coursework.
4. Communication: Keep open lines of communication with students and their families to provide ongoing support and address any concerns they may have.
5. Encourage self-care: Encourage students to prioritize self-care and take breaks when needed to avoid burnout.
6. Create a supportive environment: Foster a supportive and understanding school culture that acknowledges the loss and provides a safe space for students to talk about their feelings and share their experiences.
7. Offer resources: Provide students with resources such as counseling services, support groups, or hotlines that can help them cope with their grief.
8. Encourage peer support: Encourage students to connect with peers who have experienced similar losses, as this can provide a sense of connection and support.
9. Provide opportunities for reflection: Offer students opportunities to reflect on their experiences and share their thoughts and feelings in a safe and supportive environment.
10. Celebrate their strengths: Acknowledge and celebrate the strengths and resilience of students who have experienced loss, as this can help them feel more confident and motivated in their academic pursuits.

I hope these suggestions are helpful in supporting the educational success of students who have experienced a recent loss.
