There are several challenges that recently divorced, multiple times, active-duty military personnel may face in the job market. These include:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there can be a stigma attached to being a military divorcee, particularly if you have been married multiple times. Some employers may view you as unreliable or unstable, which can make it harder to find a job.
2. Limited job opportunities: Military spouses often face challenges when trying to advance in their careers due to frequent moves and the need to balance work and family responsibilities. This can limit their job options and potential for career advancement.
3. Lack of networking opportunities: As a military spouse, you may have limited opportunities to network and build professional connections due to frequent moves and the need to prioritize family responsibilities.
4. Difficulty transitioning to civilian life: Transitioning from military to civilian life can be challenging for anyone, but it can be especially difficult for those who have been married multiple times. You may struggle to adjust to a non-military culture and way of life.
5. Financial instability: Military divorcees may face financial instability due to the division of assets and debts during a divorce. This can make it harder to find a job or advance in your career.
6. Emotional stress: Going through a divorce, especially multiple times, can take an emotional toll on you. You may feel anxious, depressed, or stressed, which can impact your ability to perform well in the job market.
7. Childcare responsibilities: Military spouses often have childcare responsibilities, which can limit their job opportunities and potential for career advancement.
8. Limited job training and education: Military spouses may have limited access to job training and education due to frequent moves and the need to prioritize family responsibilities.
9. Unpredictable work schedule: Military personnel often have unpredictable work schedules, which can make it difficult for military spouses to plan their careers and maintain a stable work-life balance.
10. Lack of resources: Military spouses may lack access to resources such as career counseling, job placement services, and networking opportunities
