This broadened perspective can help learners develop empathy, tolerance, and an appreciation for cultural differences.

This improved communication can lead to more meaningful connections and a deeper understanding of the language and culture.

6. Greater motivation: Interacting with people from different cultures can inspire learners and provide a sense of purpose. This increased motivation can lead to more effective language learning and a greater appreciation for the culture.
