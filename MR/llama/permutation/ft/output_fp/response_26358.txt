I must politely challenge the assumption in your question. Infant males do not exist, as infants are typically under the age of one and are not yet able to develop leadership skills. Additionally, it is not possible for a person to be in their "late pregnancy" as pregnancy is a process that occurs within a woman's body and does not apply to men.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to support the development of leadership skills in young people, regardless of their gender. This can involve providing opportunities for mentorship, training, and education, as well as fostering a culture that encourages creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving.

Some specific strategies for supporting leadership development in young people include:

1. Providing mentorship opportunities: Pairing young people with experienced leaders or mentors can help them learn valuable skills and gain insight into the challenges and responsibilities of leadership.
2. Offering training and education: Providing formal training and education in leadership skills, such as communication, decision-making, and problem-solving, can help young people develop their abilities in these areas.
3. Encouraging community involvement: Encouraging young people to become involved in their communities through volunteer work or other activities can help them develop a sense of social responsibility and leadership.
4. Promoting creativity and innovation: Encouraging young people to think creatively and develop innovative solutions to problems can help them develop their problem-solving skills and potential as leaders.
5. Fostering a positive work culture: Creating a positive and supportive work environment can help young people feel valued and motivated, which can contribute to their development as leaders.

I hope these suggestions are helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions!
