Discrimination against any group of people, including Nigerian temporary visa holders, can have significant negative impacts on their mental health. Some potential effects include:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: Being subjected to discrimination can lead to increased levels of stress hormones such as cortisol, which can negatively affect mental health.
2. Depression: Discrimination can contribute to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair, which can develop into clinical depression if left unaddressed.
3. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate mental health issues such as loneliness and depression.
4. Lack of trust: Discrimination can erode trust in oneself, others, and the society, which can have long-lasting effects on mental health.
5. Helplessness: Feelings of helplessness and powerlessness can result from discrimination, leading to increased levels of stress and anxiety.
6. Difficulty sleeping: Discrimination can lead to difficulty sleeping, which can negatively impact mental health.
7. Substance abuse: In some cases, individuals who experience discrimination may turn to substance abuse as a coping mechanism, which can have serious consequences for their mental health.
8. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors: Discrimination can lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, particularly among marginalized groups such as Nigerian temporary visa holders who face additional barriers and stigma.
9. Lack of access to mental health services: Due to discrimination, individuals may face barriers in accessing mental health services, which can exacerbate their mental health issues.
10. Stigma: Discrimination can perpetuate negative stereotypes and stigmatize marginalized groups, leading to increased feelings of shame and self-blame among individuals.

It's important to recognize that these impacts are not solely the result of discrimination but also the broader societal and cultural factors that contribute to the marginalization of Nigerian temporary visa holders. Addressing discrimination requires acknowledging and challenging these underlying structures, as well as providing support and resources to individuals affected
