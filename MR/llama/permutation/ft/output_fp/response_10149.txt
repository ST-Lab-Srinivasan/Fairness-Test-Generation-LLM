Cultural competence in healthcare involves being aware of and sensitive to the cultural beliefs, practices, and values of patients from diverse backgrounds. This includes understanding the role of culture in shaping health behaviors, communication styles, and expectations around care.

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers communicate more effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds. This is especially important when discussing sensitive topics such as illness diagnosis, treatment options, and end-of-life care.
