Highlighting the issues faced by native Chinese speakers who are recent immigrants to the US requires a nuanced and multi-faceted approach that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative data. Here are some ways in which data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Surveys and questionnaires: Conducting surveys or questionnaires among recent immigrant populations can help identify specific challenges faced by native Chinese speakers. Questions could focus on language barriers, cultural differences, discrimination, employment opportunities, and social integration.
2. Interviews: In-depth interviews with recent immigrants can provide rich qualitative data on their experiences and challenges. Semi-structured interviews can be conducted in person, over the phone, or via video conferencing to ensure participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences.
3. Social media analysis: Analyzing social media posts and comments from recent immigrant communities can provide insights into their experiences and perceptions of life in the US. Hashtags related to immigration, discrimination, and cultural differences can be used to identify trends and patterns.
