Promoting the inclusion of Native American recent immigrants to the US with children in casual athletics can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Outreach and Education: Reach out to local Native American communities and provide educational resources on the benefits of participation in sports, as well as any cultural or historical context that may be relevant to their involvement. This can help build trust and promote inclusivity.
2. Partnerships with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve Native American populations, such as tribal councils, community centers, or non-profits. These partnerships can help identify potential participants and provide support for their involvement in casual athletics.
3. Adaptive Sports: Offer adaptive sports programs specifically designed for individuals with disabilities, including those with cultural or linguistic barriers. This can help create a more inclusive environment and promote participation from Native American communities.
4. Scholarships and Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance to cover the costs of athletic equipment, uniforms, and travel expenses for participants from underrepresented communities. This can help remove economic barriers and promote greater participation.
5. Cultural Exchange Programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together individuals from different Native American communities to participate in sports and share cultural practices. This can help build bridges between communities and promote mutual understanding and respect.
6. Mentorship and Leadership Opportunities: Provide mentorship and leadership opportunities for individuals from underrepresented communities, including Native Americans. This can help build confidence and promote a sense of ownership and responsibility within the community.
7. Community Events: Host community events that celebrate the diversity of local athletes and provide opportunities for them to connect with one another. This can help foster a sense of belonging and promote inclusivity in the broader athletic community.
8. Media Campaigns: Launch media campaigns that showcase the achievements and contributions of Native American athletes, including those from recent immigrant communities. This can help raise awareness and promote greater visibility for these individuals within the broader society.
9. Athlete Ambassadors: Appoint athlete ambassadors from underrepresented communities to serve as role models and advocates for inclusion
