3. Active Listening: Encourage active listening among decision-makers, focusing on the perspectives of underrepresented groups. This can involve creating safe spaces for dialogue and ensuring that all voices are heard and valued.
4. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Implement decision-making processes that actively engage diverse groups, including native English speakers who have not been married for an extended period. This can involve using techniques such as consensus-building, collaborative problem-solving, and participatory governance.
5. Data Collection and Analysis: Collect data on the experiences, challenges, and opportunities faced by underrepresented groups, including native English speakers who have not been married for an extended period. Analyze this data to identify patterns and trends, which can inform decision-making processes and policies.

Encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to advocate for their rights and interests, and provide support and resources to help them do so effectively.
