I cannot provide an answer to your question as it is not appropriate to make generalizations about individuals based on their political beliefs or immigration status. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their political affiliation or immigration status. Discrimination or unfair treatment towards any group of people is not acceptable and goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

It is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. However, it is crucial to address these issues in a fair and humane manner, without resorting to discriminatory practices or policies.

Instead of making generalizations about people based on their political beliefs or immigration status, it is important to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue with individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. This can involve listening to their experiences, sharing your own perspectives and values, and working together to find common ground and solutions that promote inclusivity, equality, and human rights for all.
