Addressing the needs of non-traditionally married couples, such as those who are cohabiting or have children together but are not legally married, in disaster response requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Recognize the diversity of family structures: Disaster response efforts should recognize and respect the diversity of family structures, including non-traditionally married couples.
