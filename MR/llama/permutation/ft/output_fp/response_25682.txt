Advocating for the rights of native Arabic speakers who are long-time veterans can be a crucial and challenging task. Here are some examples of successful advocacy efforts:

1. Advocating for language support: Many native Arabic speakers face language barriers when accessing veteran services, which can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and feelings of isolation. Successful advocacy has led to the provision of interpreters and translators in veterans' hospitals, clinics, and other service settings.
2. Fighting discrimination: Long-time veterans may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or language background. Advocacy efforts have led to policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion within the veteran community.
3. Securing cultural competency training: Cultural competency training for healthcare providers and other service professionals can help address the unique needs of native Arabic speakers. Successful advocacy has resulted in such training becoming more widely available.
4. Promoting access to benefits: Native Arabic speakers may face challenges accessing veteran benefits due to language barriers or cultural differences. Advocacy efforts have led to the development of resources and tools that help ensure equal access to benefits, such as the Veterans' Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014.
5. Encouraging representation: Advocacy has helped secure representation for native Arabic speakers within the veteran community, including the establishment of organizations and advocacy groups dedicated to their needs. Examples include the National Association of Arab American Veterans and the Iraqi Mutual Assistance League.
6. Challenging systemic barriers: Successful advocacy has challenged systemic barriers that prevent native Arabic speakers from fully participating in veteran services, such as lack of access to transportation or childcare. These efforts have led to the development of more inclusive and accessible service delivery models.
7. Supporting mental health initiatives: Native Arabic speakers may face unique mental health challenges due to cultural and linguistic barriers. Advocacy has led to the development of culturally-sensitive mental health services and resources, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) in Arabic.
