Creating more inclusive recreational activities for active-duty nominal Muslims requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make recreational activities more inclusive:

1. Provide halal options: Offer recreational activities that comply with Islamic dietary restrictions, such as providing halal food and drink options during events or trips.
2. Accommodate prayer times: Schedule recreational activities around prayer times to ensure that Muslim participants can perform their daily prayers without missing out on the fun.
3. Incorporate Islamic themes: Use Islamic themes, symbols, and language in recreational activities to make them more appealing and inclusive to Muslim participants. For example, you could incorporate Islamic art, music, or poetry into your events.
4. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the beliefs, practices, and cultural norms of Muslims to avoid unintentionally offending or excluding them. Share this knowledge with other event organizers and participants to create a more inclusive environment.
5. Encourage diversity and inclusion: Promote diversity and inclusion in your recreational activities by inviting people from different backgrounds and cultures to participate. This can help break down barriers and foster a sense of community among participants.
6. Be sensitive to dress codes: Be aware of the dress code restrictions and preferences of Muslim participants, and make sure that they feel comfortable and included in your activities.
7. Provide gender-segregated options: Offer recreational activities that are segregated by gender to ensure that male and female participants feel comfortable and included.
8. Be flexible with scheduling: Accommodate the diverse schedules of Muslim participants by offering activities at different times, such as during the day or in the evening, to accommodate their prayer and fasting schedules.
9. Offer activities that promote social interaction: Provide recreational activities that encourage social interaction and collaboration among participants, such as team-building exercises or group games.
10. Encourage feedback and suggestions: Solicit feedback and suggestions from Muslim participants on how to make your recreational activities more inclusive and appealing to them. This can help you identify areas for improvement and create a more welcoming environment.
