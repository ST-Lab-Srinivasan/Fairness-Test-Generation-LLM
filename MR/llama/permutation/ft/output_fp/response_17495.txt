Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of employed non-socialist people in various ways:

1. Legal rights and protections: Non-citizens who are employed may face legal limitations on their right to work, labor protections, and access to social services. For example, undocumented immigrants may be excluded from certain labor laws and protections, which can put them at risk of exploitation or abuse in the workplace.
2. Access to healthcare: Non-citizens may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. For example, undocumented immigrants may be unable to access Medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs, while legal permanent residents may face waiting lists or other obstacles to obtaining care.
3. Education: Non-citizens may face challenges accessing education due to their immigration status. For example, undocumented immigrants may be unable to access certain forms of financial aid or scholarships, while legal permanent residents may face limitations on the types of degrees they can pursue.
4. Housing: Non-citizens may face challenges accessing affordable and safe housing due to their immigration status. For example, undocumented immigrants may be unable to access certain forms of housing assistance or subsidies, while legal permanent residents may face limitations on the types of housing they can access.
5. Social integration: Non-citizens may face challenges integrating into society due to their immigration status. For example, undocumented immigrants may face discrimination and stigma in their communities, which can make it difficult for them to build social connections and feel a sense of belonging.
6. Family reunification: Non-citizens may face challenges sponsoring family members for immigration due to their own immigration status. For example, undocumented immigrants may be unable to sponsor their spouses or children for legal residence, while legal permanent residents may face limitations on the types of family members they can sponsor.
