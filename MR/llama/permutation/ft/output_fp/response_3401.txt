As an AI language model, I cannot generalize the experiences of all individuals who have turned 65 or over 85 and are beginners in the English language. However, I can provide some potential challenges that older adults may face when communicating with healthcare providers in a second language:

1. Language barriers: Older adults may struggle to communicate their symptoms, medical history, or treatment preferences due to language barriers. They may have difficulty understanding medical terminology or using complex medical vocabulary.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Older adults who are not proficient in the local language may face challenges accessing healthcare services, such as scheduling appointments, filling out forms, or understanding instructions provided by healthcare providers.
3. Miscommunication: Language barriers can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between older adults and their healthcare providers, which can result in inadequate care or missed diagnoses.
4. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Older adults who are new to a country or region may struggle to navigate the complexities of its healthcare system, including finding the right providers, understanding insurance coverage, and accessing necessary resources.
5. Cultural differences: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of older adults from diverse backgrounds, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
6. Lack of trust: Older adults who are non-native English speakers may feel uncomfortable communicating with healthcare providers, especially if they have had negative experiences in the past. This lack of trust can lead to delayed or inadequate care.
7. Stigma and shame: Older adults who are not proficient in the local language may feel embarrassed or ashamed about their situation, which can affect their ability to seek medical attention or disclose personal information to healthcare providers.
8. Limited access to resources: Older adults who are not fluent in the local language may have limited access to health-related resources such as support groups, advocacy organizations, or patient education materials.
9. Difficulty understanding complex medical concepts: Older adults may struggle to understand complex medical terminology or procedures, which can lead to confusion
