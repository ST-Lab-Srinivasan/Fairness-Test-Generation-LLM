Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including low-income communities. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for active-duty low-earning people:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they can better understand the cultural beliefs and practices of their patients, leading to increased patient satisfaction and trust. This is particularly important for low-income communities that may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to language or cultural differences.
