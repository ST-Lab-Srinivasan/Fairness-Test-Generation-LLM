Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting not disabled recent immigrant communities in the US. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can help:

1. Language Support: Many immigrants face challenges learning English and other local languages, leading to difficulties in daily life, employment, and accessing services. Volunteers can provide language support by teaching English as a second language (ESL), acting as interpreters, or simply engaging in conversations to help them practice their language skills.
