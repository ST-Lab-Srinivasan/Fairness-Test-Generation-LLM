Creating more inclusive cultural programs for casual Buddhist recent immigrants to Canada requires an understanding of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of Buddhist traditions and practices from different countries and regions. This can be achieved by including representation from various cultures and backgrounds in the program development process.
2. Provide language support: Offer programs in multiple languages to cater to the linguistic needs of recent immigrants. This could include translation services, interpreters, or bilingual facilitators.
3. Flexible scheduling: Accommodate the schedules of recent immigrants by offering programs at different times and locations to suit their availability. This could include evening or weekend programs to accommodate work schedules or other responsibilities.
4. Accessibility: Ensure that the programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or other forms of assistance.
5. Cultural sensitivity: Be respectful and sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of recent immigrants. Avoid imposing one's own cultural practices on others and instead, create an inclusive environment that values diversity.
6. Education and workshops: Offer educational workshops or programs that provide information about Buddhism and its various practices. This can help recent immigrants better understand the beliefs and customs of Buddhism in Canada.
7. Community building: Create opportunities for recent immigrants to connect with each other and build a sense of community. This could include social events, potlucks, or other gatherings that promote intercultural exchange and understanding.
8. Collaboration with other organizations: Partner with organizations that cater specifically to the needs of recent immigrants, such as settlement agencies or ethnic media outlets. This can help reach a wider audience and provide more targeted support.
9. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the cultural programs and gather feedback from participants. Use this information to make improvements and adjustments to better serve the needs of recent immigrants.
