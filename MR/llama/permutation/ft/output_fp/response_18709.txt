Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting active-duty communities, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can help:

1. Emotional Support: Pregnancy can be an emotionally challenging time, especially for military spouses who may face unique stressors such as frequent moves and deployments.
