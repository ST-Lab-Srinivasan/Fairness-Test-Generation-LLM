I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their immigration status. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's worth, value, or contributions to society.

Immigrants are an integral part of many societies around the world, and they make significant contributions to their host countries in terms of culture, economy, and innovation. They are also entitled to the same basic rights and freedoms as any other person, including the right to work, access to education, and protection from discrimination and exploitation.

It is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, as it can affect their access to basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare. However, it is not appropriate to make sweeping generalizations about the impacts of immigration status on any group of people without proper research and evidence.

Instead, I would recommend focusing on ways to support and empower marginalized communities, including those who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status. This can involve advocating for policies that promote inclusivity, equity, and social justice, as well as providing direct support and resources to these individuals and families.
