Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including native French speakers who have recently immigrated to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved patient communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate more effectively with patients from different cultural backgrounds. For native French speakers, it can help bridge the language barrier and ensure that their needs and concerns are heard and addressed.
