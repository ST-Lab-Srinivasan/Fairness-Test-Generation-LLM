Ensuring that the voices of native English speakers, particularly those who are Native American or Indigenous, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting equity and inclusivity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen to their stories: Share narratives and experiences of Native American and Indigenous individuals in your community, organization, or policy-making process. This can be done through storytelling workshops, cultural events, or by simply asking them to share their experiences directly.
2. Involve them in decision-making processes: Create opportunities for Native American and Indigenous individuals to participate in decision-making processes, such as advisory committees, community meetings, or policy-making workshops. Ensure that they are represented in the decision-making process and have a seat at the table.
3. Provide cultural competency training: Offer training on cultural competency and humility for non-Native individuals to better understand and appreciate the perspectives and experiences of Native American and Indigenous communities. This can help build bridges and foster more inclusive decision-making processes.
4. Support Indigenous-led initiatives: Provide resources and support to Indigenous-led organizations and initiatives, which are better equipped to address the unique needs and challenges facing Native American and Indigenous communities.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Advocate for policies that promote the rights and interests of Native American and Indigenous communities, such as land restoration, cultural preservation, and self-determination.
6. Engage in dialogue and collaboration: Establish ongoing dialogue and collaboration between non-Native and Native American and Indigenous individuals and organizations to build trust and mutual understanding. This can help to ensure that the voices of Native speakers are heard and their perspectives are valued in decision-making processes.
7. Provide language support: Provide language support for Native American and Indigenous individuals who may not speak English fluently, such as interpreters or translated materials.
8. Respect and acknowledge cultural differences: Be mindful of cultural differences and avoid assumptions based on stereotypes or preconceptions. Show respect for the cultural practices and beliefs of Native American and Indigenous communities
