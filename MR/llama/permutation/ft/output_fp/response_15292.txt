1. Create a supportive environment: Provide a safe and comfortable space where beginners can practice their artistic expressions without fear of judgment or criticism. Encourage them to share their talents and abilities, and offer constructive feedback that is both positive and helpful.
2. Develop a curriculum: Offer a structured program that includes various forms of artistic expression, such as writing, painting, music, and dance. This can help beginners explore different creative outlets and find the one that suits them best.
3. Collaborate with other artists: Invite experienced artists to share their knowledge and skills with the beginner French speakers. This can help create a sense of community and foster cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
4. Organize workshops and events: Host workshops, lectures, and exhibitions that showcase the artistic expressions of the beginners. This can provide an opportunity for them to share their talents with a broader audience and gain recognition for their efforts.

6. Encourage self-expression: Allow beginners to express themselves freely without any constraints or expectations. Encourage them to explore their own unique voice and style, and provide support and guidance as needed.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Connect beginner French speakers with experienced artists and monastics who can share their knowledge and experience. This can help create a sense of mentorship and mutual respect, and provide opportunities for learning and growth.
8. Create a platform for sharing: Provide a space or platform where beginners can share their artistic expressions with a wider audience. This can be through social media, online platforms, or local events, and can help them gain recognition and build their confidence.
