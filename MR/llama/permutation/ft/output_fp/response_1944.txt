Ensuring that the healthcare needs of individuals with known genetic conditions, including those who are Native American or Alaska Native, is a critical aspect of healthcare delivery. Here are some strategies that can help ensure that their healthcare needs are met:

1. Cultural competency training for healthcare providers: Healthcare providers should receive cultural competency training to understand the unique healthcare needs of Native American and Alaska Native communities. This training should include information on traditional healing practices, cultural beliefs and values, and how to provide culturally sensitive care.
2. Community-based care: Providing care that is responsive to the specific needs of Native American and Alaska Native communities requires a community-based approach. Healthcare providers should work closely with tribal leaders, elders, and other community members to understand their healthcare needs and preferences.
3. Collaboration with tribal health organizations: Tribal health organizations play a critical role in providing healthcare services to Native American and Alaska Native communities. Healthcare providers should collaborate with these organizations to ensure that care is culturally appropriate and accessible to community members.
4. Genetic testing and counseling: Offering genetic testing and counseling can help identify individuals who may be at risk for inherited genetic conditions. Healthcare providers should work closely with genetic counselors and other specialists to provide appropriate testing and counseling services.
5. Access to specialized care: Individuals with known genetic conditions may require specialized medical care, such as from a geneticist or a specialist in a particular condition. Healthcare providers should work to ensure that these individuals have access to the specialized care they need.
6. Patient navigation: Providing patient navigation services can help ensure that individuals with known genetic conditions receive comprehensive and culturally appropriate care. This may involve connecting patients with community resources, cultural healers, or other healthcare providers as needed.
7. Addressing social determinants of health: Social determinants of health, such as poverty, lack of access to healthy food and exercise opportunities, and other factors, can impact an individual's overall health and well-being. Healthcare providers should work to address these social determinants of health to improve the health outcomes of Native American and Alaska
