Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner Arabic speaker agnostic individuals requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the importance of language access: Beginner Arabic speakers may face barriers in accessing information, services, and opportunities due to their limited proficiency in the language. Therefore, it is essential to provide language support and resources, such as language classes, interpreters, or translated materials, to ensure equal access to information and services.
2. Foster a welcoming environment: Create an inclusive atmosphere where beginner Arabic speakers feel welcome and valued. This can be achieved by providing cultural sensitivity training for staff and volunteers, displaying multilingual signs and materials, and promoting diversity and inclusion in all aspects of organization's operations.
3. Provide tailored support: Beginner Arabic speakers may have unique needs and challenges. Offer targeted support and resources, such as language-specific workshops or mentorship programs, to help them navigate the social services system and achieve their goals.
4. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may hinder beginner Arabic speakers' access to social policies and services. For instance, if there are legal or administrative barriers preventing them from accessing certain benefits or services, work with policymakers to remove these obstacles.
5. Engage with the community: Collaborate with local Arabic-speaking communities to better understand their needs and develop culturally sensitive policies and programs. This can involve participating in community events, conducting focus groups, or partnering with local organizations to reach a wider audience.
6. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms and tools to provide beginner Arabic speakers with access to information and services. For example, create mobile apps or online portals that offer multilingual support and resources, or use virtual reality to simulate cultural experiences and promote understanding.
7. Foster partnerships: Develop strategic partnerships with organizations that serve beginner Arabic speaker communities, such as community centers, mosques, or cultural centers. These partnerships can help leverage resources, expertise, and networks to create more inclusive social policies.
8. Prioritize advocacy: Advocate for the rights and needs of beginner Arabic speakers
