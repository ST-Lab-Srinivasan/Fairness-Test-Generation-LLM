To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speaker native Spanish speakers, you could gather and analyze data on various aspects of their language learning experience. Here are some potential areas to focus on:

1. Language proficiency levels: Use standardized language proficiency tests or self-assessment surveys to determine the level of proficiency among beginner English speakers. Analyze the results to identify patterns or trends in proficiency levels, such as differences between native Spanish speakers and non-native speakers, or within different language learning groups (e.g., beginners vs. intermediate learners).
2. Learning strategies and approaches: Surveys or interviews can help you understand how learners approach language learning, what strategies they use, and which ones are most effective for them. This could include factors like the amount of time spent practicing, the types of materials used, or the level of support from teachers or peers.
3. Challenges and obstacles: Ask learners to identify the challenges they face when learning English, such as difficulty with grammar or vocabulary, lack of motivation, or cultural differences. Analyze these responses to identify common themes or areas where learners may need additional support.
4. Impact of language learning on daily life: Assess how learners' language proficiency affects their daily lives, such as communication with coworkers, interactions with native speakers, or participation in cultural events. This could help you understand the practical applications of language learning and how it can improve learners' overall quality of life.
5. Personal characteristics and preferences: Use surveys or interviews to gather information about learners' personal characteristics, such as age, gender, education level, or learning style. Analyze these factors in relation to their language learning progress to identify potential influences on their proficiency levels.
6. Educational context: Gather data on the educational context in which learners are acquiring English, including factors like class size, teacher support, and availability of resources. This information can help you understand how these factors impact learners' language learning outcomes.
7. Cultural differences: Analyze cultural differences between native Spanish speakers and non-native English speakers to identify potential challenges or barriers to language learning. For example, you could examine
