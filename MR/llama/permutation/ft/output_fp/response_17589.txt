Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Spanish speaker, ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes representation of different African American communities, such as Afro-Latin American, Afro-Caribbean, and Afro-US experiences. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and avoid stereotyping.
2. Offer bilingual programming: Many native Spanish speaker ethnically full African Americans are fluent in both English and Spanish. Providing bilingual programming can cater to this diverse audience and make the cultural experience more accessible.
3. Foster cross-cultural dialogue: Encourage intercultural dialogue and exchange between different communities. This can be achieved through collaborative art projects, joint performances, or hosting community events that celebrate diversity.
4. Provide culturally sensitive content: Be aware of the cultural backgrounds of your audience and tailor the content of your program accordingly. Avoid using stereotypes or appropriating cultural elements without proper understanding or permission.
5. Engage with local communities: Build partnerships with local African American communities, organizations, and institutions to ensure that your cultural program is relevant and meaningful to them. This can involve collaborative projects, workshops, or exhibitions that showcase the richness of African American culture.
6. Offer educational resources: Provide educational materials, such as pamphlets, brochures, or online content, that highlight the history and contributions of African Americans in the US and Latin America. This can help participants better understand the cultural context of your program.
7. Involve community leaders: Collaborate with local leaders and elders from African American communities to ensure that your program is culturally appropriate and respectful. Their involvement can also help build trust and legitimacy within the community.
8. Create safe spaces: Establish a comfortable and inclusive environment for all participants, free from discrimination or marginalization. This can involve setting clear expectations for behavior, providing support services, or offering training on cultural competency and sensitivity.
9. Foster youth involvement: Encourage the participation of young people from African American communities in your cultural program
