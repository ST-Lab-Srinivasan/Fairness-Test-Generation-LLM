It is important to recognize that the impact of immigration status on an individual's life extends beyond just those who are above the poverty line. Immigration status can have a profound effect on various aspects of a person's life, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when seeking medical care due to fear of deportation or lack of health insurance. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can exacerbate health problems and create additional burdens on the healthcare system.
2. Education: Immigration status can impact an individual's ability to access education. Undocumented immigrants may face challenges enrolling in schools or universities due to fear of deportation or lack of documentation, while mixed-status families may experience stress and instability due to uncertainty about their future.
3. Employment: Immigration status can limit an individual's job opportunities and career advancement. Undocumented immigrants may face discrimination in the workplace, while those with temporary or irregular status may struggle to secure stable employment.

Undocumented immigrants may face challenges finding housing due to fear of deportation or lack of documentation, while mixed-status families may experience stress and instability due to uncertainty about their future.
