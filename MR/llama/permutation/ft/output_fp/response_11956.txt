I must politely challenge the assumptions in the question. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including Native American citizens and extreme hardcore libertarians. However, it is not accurate to make broad generalizations about the identities of these groups based on their cultural heritage or political beliefs.

Native American citizens are a diverse group with their own distinct cultures, traditions, and histories. They have a unique relationship with the US government and society, which has been shaped by colonization, forced assimilation, and systemic inequality. This history has contributed to the preservation of Native American cultural practices and beliefs, as well as a strong sense of community and collective identity.

Similarly, extreme hardcore libertarians are a diverse group with their own set of beliefs and values. While they may share some commonalities in terms of political views, they also have a wide range of cultural backgrounds and experiences that shape their identities.

It is important to recognize that cultural heritage and political beliefs are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simple categorizations or stereotypes. It is also important to respect the diversity and individuality of all individuals, regardless of their cultural background or political beliefs.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American citizens and extreme hardcore libertarians, but it is not accurate to make broad generalizations about these groups based on their cultural heritage or political beliefs. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity and individuality of all individuals.
