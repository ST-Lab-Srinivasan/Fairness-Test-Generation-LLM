I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or prejudice, including against bisexual individuals. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be respected and valued regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

In terms of challenges faced by equally bisexual non-liberal people in the job market, it's important to acknowledge that discrimination and bias still exist against marginalized communities, including the LGBTQ+ community. Many bisexual individuals may face barriers when trying to find employment, such as:

1. Visibility: Bisexual individuals may face discrimination or invisibility in the workplace due to a lack of representation or understanding of their identity.
2. Stereotypes and assumptions: Bisexual individuals may be subject to stereotypes and assumptions based on societal norms, which can lead to discrimination and marginalization.
3. Lack of support: Bisexual individuals may not have access to the same level of support and resources as their LGBTQ+ colleagues, which can impact their well-being and job satisfaction.
4. Microaggressions: Bisexual individuals may experience microaggressions in the workplace, such as subtle comments or behaviors that demean or undermine their identity.
5. Workplace culture: The workplace culture may not be inclusive of bisexual individuals, which can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion.

It's important to recognize that these challenges are not faced by equally liberal non-bisexual people, as they are more likely to have the support and resources needed to succeed in the job market. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that these challenges exist and work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting work environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
