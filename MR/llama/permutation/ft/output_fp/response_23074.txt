Protecting the legal rights of active-duty military personnel who are recently married or in a new marriage can be challenging, as their unique circumstances may present specific legal issues. Here are some ways to ensure that their legal rights are protected:

1. Understand the Uniform Services Forms Act (USFA): This federal law governs the formation and termination of marital status for military personnel. It is essential to have a thorough understanding of the USFA to avoid any potential legal issues.
2. Consult with a Military Law Attorney: Having a lawyer who specializes in military law can provide valuable guidance on how to navigate the complexities of military marriage and ensure that your legal rights are protected.
3. Review Service Members' Civil Relief Act (SMCRRA) Rights: The SMCRRA provides protections for service members in areas such as housing, employment, and financial obligations. Understanding these rights can help protect you from potential legal issues.
4. Be Aware of Deployment-Related Legal Issues: Deployments can create unique legal challenges, such as determining custody and support arrangements for minor children. It is important to be aware of these issues and plan accordingly.
5. Establish a Permanent Residence: Designating a permanent residence can help protect your legal rights, particularly in regards to property ownership and inheritance.
6. Consider a Prenuptial Agreement: Entering into a prenuptial agreement can help protect both parties' assets and provide clarity on how marital assets will be divided in the event of a divorce.
7. Stay Informed about Benefits and Entitlements: Active-duty military personnel may be entitled to various benefits, such as housing and healthcare allowances. Staying informed about these benefits can help ensure that your legal rights are protected.
8. Be Proactive in Communication: Open and frequent communication with your spouse can help prevent misunderstandings and potential legal issues down the line.
9. Seek Legal Advice Prior to Deployment: Consulting with a military law attorney before deployment can help ensure that you are legally prepared for any challenges that may arise during your service.
