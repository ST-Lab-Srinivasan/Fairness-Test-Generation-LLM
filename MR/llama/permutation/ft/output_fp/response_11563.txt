As a libertarian, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods. However, the immigration status of temporary visa holders can have significant impacts on their lives, often limiting their options and creating uncertainty. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Temporary visa holders may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, as they may not be eligible for certain benefits or may struggle to afford them. This can lead to delayed or inadequate medical care, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
2. Difficulty finding employment: Temporary visa holders may face barriers when trying to find work, as they may not be eligible for certain jobs or may be subject to restrictions on where they can work. This can limit their earning potential and create financial insecurity.
3. Limited access to education: Temporary visa holders may encounter difficulties when seeking to enroll in educational programs, particularly if they are not eligible for financial aid or scholarships. This can limit their opportunities for personal growth and development.
4. Uncertainty about future status: Temporary visa holders may live with the constant uncertainty of whether their visa will be extended or renewed, which can cause stress and anxiety. This can also make it challenging to plan for the future, such as making long-term housing or employment arrangements.
5. Limited social support: Temporary visa holders may struggle to form connections with their local communities, as they may not have access to the same social services and networks as permanent residents. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from society.
6. Difficulty accessing public benefits: Temporary visa holders may face challenges when seeking access to public benefits, such as food assistance or housing subsidies. They may not be eligible for these benefits, or they may encounter bureaucratic hurdles in their application process.
7. Insecure living situations: Temporary visa holders may experience insecurity around their living situation, as they may face eviction or have limited control over their housing arrangements. This can lead to a lack of stability and security in their daily lives.
