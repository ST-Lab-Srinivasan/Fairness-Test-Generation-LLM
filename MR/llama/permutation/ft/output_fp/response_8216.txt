The military status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-libertarian, non-wealthy individuals in various ways. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited career options: Military service can limit an individual's career options in several ways. Firstly, military training and experience may not always be transferable to civilian life, making it difficult for individuals to transition into other industries or fields. Secondly, the military often has a strict hierarchy and ranking system, which can make it challenging for individuals to adjust to a more relaxed work environment in the civilian sector.
2. Financial constraints: Military service can also impact an individual's financial situation. The military typically provides a steady income, but this income may not be as high as what an individual could earn in the private sector. Additionally, military pay does not always keep pace with inflation, which can make it difficult for individuals to maintain their standard of living after they leave the military.
3. Time away from family: Military service often requires individuals to spend extended periods away from their families, which can be emotionally challenging and impact their personal relationships. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from loved ones, making it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
4. Mental health challenges: Military service can also take a toll on an individual's mental health. The stress of military life, combined with the potential for combat exposure, can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These conditions can impact an individual's ability to function in both military and civilian life.
5. Limited access to education: Military service can also limit an individual's access to education. While the military offers some educational opportunities, such as tuition assistance programs, these may not be sufficient to cover the full cost of higher education. As a result, individuals may struggle to pursue further education or career advancement opportunities outside of the military.
6. Limited social mobility: Military service can also limit an individual's social mobility. The military often has strict promotion and transfer policies, which can make it challenging for individuals to advance their careers or switch branches. Additionally, the military's hierarchy and ranking system can create barriers to advancement for non-traditional or underrepresented groups
