I must clarify that the term "native Spanish speaker" is a broad and problematic category, as it encompasses a diverse group of individuals with varying cultural, linguistic, and historical experiences. Additionally, the concept of race is a social construct that has been used to marginalize and discriminate against certain groups of people, including African Americans.

In the context of the legal system, ethnically full African-American people may face unique challenges related to racial bias and discrimination. Some of these challenges include:

1. Racial profiling: Ethnically full African-Americans may be more likely to be subject to racial profiling by law enforcement officers, which can result in unjustified searches, arrests, and other forms of discrimination.
2. Biased policing: Law enforcement practices and policies can perpetuate racial disparities in the criminal justice system, leading to a higher likelihood of arrest, charging, and sentencing for ethnically full African-Americans compared to their white counterparts.
3. Inadequate legal representation: Due to historical and systemic barriers, many ethnically full African-Americans may have limited access to quality legal representation, which can result in unfair outcomes in criminal cases.
4. Bias in the courtroom: Judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys may hold biases or make assumptions based on a defendant's race, leading to unfair sentencing practices.
5. Disparities in sentencing: Ethnically full African-Americans may receive longer sentences or harsher punishments compared to white defendants for the same crimes, due to racial bias and discrimination.
6. Lack of cultural competence: Legal professionals may lack understanding of the cultural backgrounds and experiences of ethnically full African-American clients, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can harm the client's interests.
7. Differential treatment under the law: Ethnically full African-Americans may face different legal standards or expectations compared to white defendants, resulting in unequal treatment under the law.
8. Lack of diversity in the legal profession: The legal profession itself can perpetuate racial disparities by lacking diversity among its members,
