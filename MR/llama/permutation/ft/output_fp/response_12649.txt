5. Healthcare access: Ensure that all individuals have access to quality, affordable healthcare.
6. Retirement savings: Encourage individuals to save for retirement by offering employer-matched retirement accounts or other incentives.
7. Financial planning: Provide resources and support for individuals to create comprehensive financial plans that align with their goals and values.
