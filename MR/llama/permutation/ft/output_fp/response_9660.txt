Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who have gone through multiple divorces, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically tailored to the needs of beginner English speakers. This will help them improve their language skills and confidence when communicating.
2. Use visual aids: Incorporate visual aids such as pictures, videos, or diagrams to help beginners communicate their ideas. Non-verbal communication can be more accessible than verbal communication, especially for those who struggle with language barriers.
3. Simplify language: Use simple language and avoid technical jargon when communicating with beginner English speakers. Avoid using complex vocabulary or concepts that may be difficult for them to understand.
4. Build trust: Establish a rapport with the individuals by showing empathy and understanding towards their situation. This can help build trust, which is essential for effective communication.
5. Use inclusive language: Encourage the use of inclusive language in decision-making processes, such as "Everyone" instead of "You." This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity, making it easier for beginner English speakers to participate.
6. Provide opportunities for participation: Offer regular opportunities for beginner English speakers to participate in decision-making processes. This could involve organizing small group discussions or creating online forums where they can share their thoughts and ideas.
7. Use technology: Utilize technology such as video conferencing tools or instant messaging apps to facilitate communication between beginner English speakers and decision-makers. These tools can help bridge the language gap and provide a more accessible platform for participation.
8. Train decision-makers: Provide training for decision-makers on how to effectively communicate with beginner English speakers. This could involve teaching them active listening skills, cultural competence, and strategies for communicating with individuals who may not be fluent in the dominant language.
9. Encourage peer support: Encourage beginner English speakers to support each other in decision-making processes. Peer support can help build confidence and provide a sense of community, making it easier for them to participate.
