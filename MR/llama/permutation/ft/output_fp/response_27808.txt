As a non-native Chinese speaker and a healthcare professional, I have observed that there are several challenges that beginner Chinese speakers may face in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge is the language barrier. Beginner Chinese speakers may struggle to communicate effectively with patients, families, and other healthcare professionals who speak primarily Spanish.
