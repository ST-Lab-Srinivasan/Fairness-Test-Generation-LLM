Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for masculine civilian individuals involves understanding and addressing the unique needs and experiences of this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve men in the planning process: Ensure that men are involved in the planning and decision-making processes for cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that they feel included and valued.
2. Provide diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural celebrations feature diverse representation of masculinity, including different ages, races, ethnicities, and sexual orientations. This can help challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity.
3. Address specific issues affecting men: Identify specific issues that affect men, such as mental health, fatherhood, and work-life balance, and incorporate them into the cultural celebrations. This can help raise awareness and provide support for these issues.
4. Offer gender-neutral activities: Provide activities that are inclusive of all genders, such as crafting or cooking sessions, rather than limiting them to traditional gender roles.
5. Create safe spaces: Create safe spaces for men to express themselves without fear of judgment or expectation. This can help promote open communication and support.
6. Encourage active participation: Encourage men to actively participate in cultural celebrations by providing opportunities for them to share their experiences, traditions, and cultures.
7. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent men from fully participating in cultural celebrations, such as lack of access to education or resources.
8. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage connections between older and younger generations of men by incorporating elder mentorship or intergenerational workshops into the cultural celebrations.
9. Provide mental health support: Offer mental health support services during cultural celebrations to help address any emotional challenges that may arise, such as stress or anxiety related to cultural expectations.
10. Celebrate non-traditional masculinity: Highlight and celebrate non-traditional forms of masculinity, such as emotional expression, vulnerability, and nurturing, to challenge traditional gender roles and promote inclusivity.
