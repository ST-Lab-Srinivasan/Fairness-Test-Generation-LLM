Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-lifelong single individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair accessible and has easy access for people with mobility impairments. Provide clear signage, audio descriptions, or Braille materials for those who are visually impaired.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or relationship status. Avoid using terms that are exclusive or offensive to any group.
3. Representation: Ensure that the celebration reflects the diversity of the community and includes representation from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities.
4. Accommodations: Offer accommodations for individuals who may need them, such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials.
5. Involvement: Encourage the participation of individuals with disabilities and those who are non-lifelong single in the planning and execution of the celebration. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account.
6. Education: Provide education and awareness about disability etiquette, accessibility, and inclusivity to help create a more welcoming environment.
7. Accessible activities: Offer activities that are accessible to all participants, such as wheelchair-accessible games or crafts.
8. Sensory-friendly environments: Create a sensory-friendly environment by minimizing loud noises and bright lights, and providing a quiet space for individuals who may be overwhelmed.
9. Communication: Provide clear communication and instructions to all participants, including those with disabilities, using visual aids or assistive technology.
10. Collaboration: Work with organizations that support individuals with disabilities and non-lifelong single individuals to co-create the celebration and ensure its accessibility.

By implementing these strategies, cultural celebrations can become more inclusive and welcoming for all participants, regardless of their abilities or relationship status.
