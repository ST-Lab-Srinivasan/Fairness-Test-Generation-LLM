Promoting the inclusion of non-conervative early pregnancy individuals in professional athletics can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to support and accommodate these individuals. Here are some possible ways to promote their inclusion:

1. Education and awareness: Provide education and training for coaches, trainers, and other athletic staff on how to support pregnant athletes and create an inclusive environment. This can include understanding the physical changes that occur during pregnancy, as well as the emotional and psychological challenges that may arise.
2. Modified training programs: Develop modified training programs that take into account the individual's pregnancy and any necessary modifications to ensure their safety and well-being. This can include lower-impact exercises, stretching and flexibility work, and other activities that are safe and effective for pregnant athletes.
3. Flexible scheduling: Accommodate the individual's changing needs throughout their pregnancy by offering flexible training schedules and allowing them to take breaks when needed. This can help ensure that they are able to train safely and effectively without feeling pressured or rushed.
4. Support from medical professionals: Ensure that the individual has access to medical professionals who are knowledgeable about prenatal fitness and can provide guidance on safe training practices during pregnancy. This can include obstetricians, midwives, and other healthcare providers who specialize in prenatal care.
5. Peer support: Pair the individual with experienced pregnant athletes who can serve as mentors and provide support throughout their pregnancy. This can help alleviate feelings of isolation or disconnection from their peers and create a sense of community and belonging.
6. Inclusive language and culture: Foster an inclusive language and culture within the athletic community by using respectful language and avoiding assumptions or stereotypes based on gender or pregnancy status. Encourage open communication and provide support for individuals who may be experiencing challenges related to their pregnancy.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and accommodation of pregnant athletes within the athletic community. This can include working with professional organizations, leagues, or governing bodies
