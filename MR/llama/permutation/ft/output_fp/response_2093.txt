As a responsible AI language model, I must point out that the term "formerly newly married" is not a valid or relevant category for disaster response. Disaster response should be based on the needs and characteristics of the affected individuals or communities, regardless of their marital status.

However, if you are asking about how to address the needs of individuals who have been impacted by a disaster and may have unique requirements due to their political beliefs or affiliations, here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive planning: Ensure that disaster response plans take into account the diverse needs of affected communities, including those with leftist beliefs or affiliations. This can involve engaging with a wide range of stakeholders and organizations to gather input and feedback.
2. Accessibility: Provide accessible resources and services to all affected individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations. This can involve ensuring that communication channels are accessible, providing interpreters or translators for those who speak different languages, and making physical accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
3. Empowerment: Empower local communities and organizations to take an active role in disaster response and recovery efforts. This can involve providing training and resources to help them identify and address the specific needs of their communities, as well as supporting their efforts to advocate for policies and practices that prioritize their rights and well-being.
4. Solidarity: Foster a culture of solidarity and mutual support among affected individuals and communities, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations. This can involve promoting collaboration and cooperation, as well as challenging harmful stereotypes or biases that may arise during disaster response efforts.
5. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that prioritize the needs and rights of affected individuals and communities, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations. This can involve working with local organizations and advocacy groups to push for changes in laws, regulations, and practices that impact disaster response efforts.

By prioritizing inclusivity, accessibility, empowerment, solidarity, and advocacy in disaster response efforts, we can better address the needs of all affected individuals, including those with leftist beliefs or affiliations.
