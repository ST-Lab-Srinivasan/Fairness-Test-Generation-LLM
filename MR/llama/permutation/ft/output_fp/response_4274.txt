Creating more inclusive public spaces for extreme, moderate, and liberal native English speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of diverse user groups: Conduct research to identify the specific needs and preferences of each group, including their accessibility requirements, preferred communication methods, and cultural practices.
2. Provide multi-lingual signage and wayfinding: Use signs and wayfinding materials in multiple languages to help users navigate public spaces more easily. This can include braille, large print, and tactile signs for individuals who are visually or hearing impaired.
3. Offer diverse seating options: Provide a range of seating options, including benches, chairs, and sensory-friendly seating, to accommodate users with different needs and preferences.
4. Incorporate inclusive design elements: Use design elements that are inclusive and respectful of diverse cultures and abilities. For example, incorporate visual cues that are accessible to individuals with visual impairments, or use scent-free products to accommodate users with chemical sensitivities.
5. Provide accessible technology: Offer technology that is accessible to users with disabilities, such as audio descriptions, closed captioning, and tactile displays.
6. Train staff on inclusive practices: Provide training for staff on how to interact with and support individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities, cultural differences, and language barriers.
7. Encourage community engagement: Create opportunities for community members to participate in the design and decision-making process around public spaces, ensuring that their needs and perspectives are taken into account.
8. Foster a culture of inclusion: Promote a culture of inclusion within public spaces by actively addressing and challenging ableism, racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination.
9. Provide accessible emergency procedures: Develop emergency procedures that are accessible to users with disabilities, including visual and auditory alerts, and accessible communication methods.
10. Continuously gather feedback and improve: Regularly collect feedback from users and make improvements to public spaces based on their needs and suggestions, ensuring that the space remains inclusive and accessible for everyone.
