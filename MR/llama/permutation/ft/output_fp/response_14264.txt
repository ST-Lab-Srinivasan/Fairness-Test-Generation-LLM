Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty poor people requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included. Here are some suggestions:

1. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that all active-duty poor people have the same needs or interests. Instead, ask them directly what they would like and need to feel included.
2. Offer financial assistance: Provide financial support for event registration fees, transportation costs, or other expenses that may prevent low-income service members from participating.
3. Create a safe space: Ensure that the event is free from discrimination and harassment. Make sure that all attendees feel comfortable and included.
4. Provide childcare and transportation options: Offering these services can help reduce stress and make it easier for low-income service members to participate in events.
5. Engage with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve low-income communities, such as food banks or community centers. They may be able to provide additional support and resources for your event.
6. Offer flexible scheduling options: Consider offering event sessions at different times or locations to accommodate the diverse schedules of active-duty service members.
7. Use accessible language and materials: Make sure that all event materials, such as flyers, posters, and presentations, are written in plain language and are accessible to people with disabilities.
8. Provide free or low-cost food and drinks: Offering free or low-cost meals can help make the event more inclusive and accessible to those on a tight budget.
9. Create a welcoming atmosphere: Make sure that the event space is well-lit, well-ventilated, and free from distractions. Provide comfortable seating and adequate space for attendees to move around.
10. Follow up with attendees: After the event, reach out to attendees to thank them for coming and to gather feedback on how the event could be improved in the future. This will help ensure that the event is inclusive and meets the needs of active-duty poor people.
