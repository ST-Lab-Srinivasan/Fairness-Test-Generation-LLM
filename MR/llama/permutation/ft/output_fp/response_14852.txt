6. Community Building: Volunteers can help build strong communities by facilitating social events, promoting cultural exchange programs, and fostering intergenerational relationships.
7. Disaster Relief: Volunteers can provide critical support during natural disasters, including search and rescue operations, provision of emergency supplies, and psychological support.
8. Advocacy: Volunteers can advocate for policy changes that benefit lower-income communities, such as affordable housing, access to education, and social welfare programs.
