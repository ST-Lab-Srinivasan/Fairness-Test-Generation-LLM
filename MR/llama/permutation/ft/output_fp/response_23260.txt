Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-socialist native Arabic speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces provide language accessibility by offering translation services, interpreters, or multilingual signage. This will enable non-Arabic speakers to navigate and participate in public life without barriers.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural norms and practices of non-socialist native Arabic speaker individuals. Avoid imposing one's own culture or belief system on others, and instead strive to create spaces that respect and appreciate diversity.
3. Inclusive Design: Design public spaces with inclusivity in mind. Use accessible design elements such as ramps, elevators, and Braille signage to ensure that everyone can access and navigate the space easily.
4. Representation Matters: Ensure that the public spaces reflect the diversity of the community they serve. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse imagery, symbols, and representations in the design of the space.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with non-Arabic speaking communities to understand their needs and preferences. This can help identify areas where inclusivity can be improved and ensure that the public spaces are responsive to the needs of all users.
6. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness programs on cultural sensitivity, diversity, and inclusion. This can help promote a culture of respect and appreciation for diversity within the community.
7. Collaborative Decision-Making: Encourage collaborative decision-making processes that involve diverse stakeholders, including non-Arabic speaking communities. This can help ensure that the public spaces are designed and managed in an inclusive manner.
8. Accessibility Features: Incorporate accessibility features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms to ensure that all users can access and use the public space easily.
9. Signage and Wayfinding: Provide clear and multilingual signage to help non-Arabic speaking individuals navigate the public space easily. This can include maps, directories, and other wayfinding tools.
10. Community Events: Host community events that celebrate diversity
