Native Arabic speakers who have recently turned 65 may face several challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: Many older Arabic speakers may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers who are not fluent in Arabic, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical needs and treatment options.
2. Cultural differences: Arab culture places a strong emphasis on family and community, which can lead to challenges in navigating the healthcare system as an older adult. Older Arabic speakers may feel uncomfortable seeking medical care without the support of their family or community.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: In some parts of the world, older Arabic speakers may have limited access to healthcare services due to geographic isolation or financial constraints. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, which can exacerbate health problems over time.
4. Stigma associated with aging: In some Arab cultures, there is a stigma associated with aging and the health issues that come with it. Older Arabic speakers may feel embarrassed or ashamed to seek medical care due to this stigma.
5. Lack of geriatric care: Many healthcare systems lack specialized geriatric care, which can lead to inadequate treatment and support for older adults with complex medical needs. Older Arabic speakers may require additional support and care that is tailored to their age-related needs.
6. Limited access to home healthcare: In some regions, there may be limited access to home healthcare services, which can make it difficult for older Arabic speakers to receive the care they need in a comfortable and familiar environment.
7. Difficulty with medication management: Older adults often have multiple medications to manage, and this can be particularly challenging for those who do not speak the dominant language of their country or region. This can lead to misunderstandings about dosage instructions, potential drug interactions, and other medication-related issues.
8. Limited access to mental health services: Older Arabic speakers may face barriers to accessing mental health services due to cultural or linguistic barriers. This can exacerbate mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, or cognitive impairment
