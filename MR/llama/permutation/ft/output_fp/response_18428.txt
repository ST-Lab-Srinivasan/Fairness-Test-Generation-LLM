Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-class, non-widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges faced by this group. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Income inequality reduction: One of the primary reasons why non-upper-class individuals face difficulties is income inequality. Policies that aim to reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation, minimum wage laws, and social welfare programs, can help level the playing field.
