5. Collaboration with Cultural Leaders: Work with cultural leaders and community elders to understand the unique cultural needs of their communities and how best to address them.
6. Patient-Centered Care: Foster patient-centered care by involving individuals and families in the decision-making process about their care, and by taking into account their cultural beliefs and practices.
7. Inclusive Healthcare Settings: Create healthcare settings that are inclusive and welcoming of all individuals, regardless of their cultural background or identity.
8. Language Accessibility: Provide language accessibility services, such as interpreters and translated materials, to ensure that individuals from diverse linguistic backgrounds have equal access to healthcare services.
