Promoting the artistic talents of beginner French speakers in their late 30s can be a rewarding and enriching experience. Here are some suggestions on how to do it:

1. Create a supportive community: Encourage your learners to connect with other beginners who share similar interests and goals. This can be done through online forums, social media groups, or in-person events. A supportive community can help learners stay motivated and inspired to continue learning and improving their French skills.
2. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage your learners to view mistakes as opportunities for growth and improvement. This can be done by praising effort rather than progress, and by emphasizing the importance of persistence and resilience.
3. Provide authentic materials: Offer your learners opportunities to engage with real-life French language materials such as books, movies, TV shows, music, and podcasts. This can help them develop a deeper understanding of the language and culture, and improve their listening and comprehension skills.
4. Encourage self-expression: Provide your learners with opportunities to express themselves creatively through writing, drawing, or other forms of artistic expression. This can help them build confidence in their abilities and develop a sense of pride in their work.
5. Offer constructive feedback: Provide your learners with regular feedback on their progress, highlighting areas of improvement and offering suggestions for how they can improve. Be sure to balance criticism with praise and encouragement to help them stay motivated and engaged.
6. Celebrate small victories: Acknowledge and celebrate the small successes and achievements of your learners, no matter how small they may seem. This can help build confidence and reinforce the idea that progress is being made.
7. Provide opportunities for performance: Encourage your learners to perform their French language skills in front of an audience, whether it's a small group of peers or a larger audience. This can help them build stage presence and confidence in their abilities.
8. Collaborate with other instructors: Collaborate with other French language instructors to provide a variety of learning opportunities for your learners. This could include joint classes, cultural events, or language exchange programs.
