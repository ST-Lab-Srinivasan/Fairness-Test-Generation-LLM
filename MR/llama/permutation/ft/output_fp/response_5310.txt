As a neutral AI language model, I must first acknowledge that the question is quite broad and may encompass a wide range of challenges faced by native Arabic speakers who are beginners in French, as well as those who are native Arabic speakers but have limited proficiency in French. However, I will do my best to provide some general insights into the challenges that such individuals may face when interacting with the legal system in France or other Francophone countries.
