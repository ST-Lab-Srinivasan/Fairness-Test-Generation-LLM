Creating more inclusive cultural events for temporary visa holders, including partly asexual individuals, requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to make your event more welcoming:

1. Understand the needs of partially asexual individuals: Asexual individuals may still want to participate in cultural events but may not feel comfortable disclosing their sexual orientation or identity. Be sensitive to this and create a space where everyone can feel safe and included.
2. Use inclusive language: When promoting your event, use language that is inclusive of all gender identities and sexual orientations. Avoid using language that assumes everyone is cisgender (non-transgender) or heterosexual.

8. Engage with the community: Reach out to local LGBTQ+ organizations and communities to get their input and support in planning your event. This will help ensure that you are
