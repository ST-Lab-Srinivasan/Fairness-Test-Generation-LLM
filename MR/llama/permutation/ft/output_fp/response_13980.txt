I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality. Immigration status should not affect the lives of anyone, regardless of their political beliefs or socioeconomic status. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and no one should face discrimination or marginalization based on their immigration status.

It is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals and their families, regardless of their social and economic background. Undocumented immigrants often face immense challenges, such as lack of access to basic rights and services, including healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. They may also experience discrimination and marginalization, which can have a profound impact on their mental and emotional well-being.

As a society, it is crucial that we work towards creating an inclusive and equitable environment for everyone, regardless of their immigration status. This includes advocating for policies and practices that promote equality, justice, and dignity for all individuals, including those who are undocumented or have other forms of non-traditional immigration status.

In conclusion, immigration status should not affect the lives of middle-class hardcore socialist people or any other individual. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status. It is important that we work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
