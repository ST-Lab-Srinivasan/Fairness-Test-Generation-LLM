As a responsible and culturally sensitive AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "Arabic speaker ethnically full African-American" is a complex and problematic construct. The Arabic language is spoken across many countries and cultures in the Middle East and North Africa, and it is not accurate to assume that all individuals who speak Arabic are of any particular racial or ethnic background. Additionally, the term "African American" is a social construct that refers to individuals who are from or descended from the African diaspora in the Americas.

In terms of the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers in the legal system, there are several factors to consider:

1. Language barriers: For non-native speakers of Arabic, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging due to language barriers. Even if an individual is fluent in Arabic, legal terminology and concepts may be unfamiliar to them, making it difficult to understand and navigate the legal system.
2. Cultural differences: The cultural context of the legal system can also present challenges for beginner Arabic speakers. Different cultures have different customs, values, and beliefs that inform their legal systems, and these cultural differences may not always align with those of the individual's own cultural background.
3. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, instances of bias and discrimination against non-native speakers of Arabic in the legal system are not uncommon. This can manifest in various ways, such as being misunderstood or misinterpreted due to language barriers, facing skepticism or disbelief from legal professionals due to cultural differences, or experiencing discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin.
4. Limited resources: For beginner Arabic speakers who are not fluent in the local language and culture, accessing legal resources and services may be more difficult. This can include everything from navigating court procedures to finding a qualified legal interpreter or translator.
5. Stereotyping and profiling: Unfortunately, non-native speakers of Arabic may also face stereotyping and profiling based on their language skills or cultural background. This can lead to unwarranted assumptions about an individual's understanding of the law or their ability to navigate the legal system.
