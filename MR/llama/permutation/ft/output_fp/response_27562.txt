1. Access to healthcare: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to healthcare services, including mental health support, due to their immigration status. This can be particularly challenging for recent singles with disabilities who require regular medical check-ups and treatments.
2. Employment barriers: Disability status can create additional barriers for temporary visa holders in the job market. Recent singles with disabilities may face discrimination, stigma, or lack of accommodations in the workplace, limiting their career advancement opportunities.
3. Social isolation: Temporary visa holders may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can be particularly challenging for recent singles with disabilities who rely on social connections and relationships for emotional support.
4. Housing instability: Recent singles with disabilities may face difficulties securing affordable and accessible housing, particularly if they are dependent on temporary visas. This can lead to housing insecurity and instability.
5. Financial strain: Temporary visa holders may experience financial strain due to limited access to employment opportunities, education, and other resources. Recent singles with disabilities may face additional financial challenges related to their disability-related expenses, such as assistive technology or home modifications.
6. Lack of representation: Temporary visa holders may feel marginalized or excluded from mainstream society due to their immigration status, which can further limit their access to resources and support. Recent singles with disabilities may face additional barriers to representation and advocacy.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Disability status can lead to stigma and discrimination against temporary visa holders, particularly recent singles. This can result in social exclusion, bullying, or harassment, further complicating their already challenging situations.
8. Limited access to support services: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to support services, such as counseling, advocacy, or legal aid, due to their immigration status. Recent singles with disabilities may face additional barriers to accessing these services
