I cannot provide a list of successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American Nigerians as there is no clear definition or documentation of what it means to be "ethnically full" African-American Nigerian. Additionally, the concept of race and ethnicity is complex and multifaceted, and individuals may identify with multiple cultures and communities throughout their lives.

However, there are many successful community initiatives led by African Americans or Nigerians who have made significant contributions to their communities. Here are a few examples:

1. The Africa Channel: Launched in 2005, The Africa Channel is a television network that showcases African and African American culture, history, and entertainment. The network was founded by Kenny Barba, who is of Nigerian descent, and features programming that highlights the diverse experiences of people from Africa and the African diaspora.
2. The Black Enterprise 50 Million Dollar Club: Founded in 1979, the Black Enterprise 50 Million Dollar Club is a list of African American businesses that have reached $50 million in revenue. The list is compiled annually by Black Enterprise magazine and highlights successful black-owned businesses across various industries.
3. The National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ): Established in 1979, NABJ is a professional organization that supports and promotes diversity in journalism. The organization provides training, networking opportunities, and advocacy for African American journalists and media professionals.
4. The National Coalition Building Institute (NCBI): NCBI is a non-profit organization that works to build bridges between different racial and ethnic groups through education and training. The organization was founded by a Nigerian-American woman, Dr. Velma Lawson, and has chapters across the United States.
5. The African American Policy Forum (AAPF): AAPF is a think tank that conducts research and analysis on issues affecting African Americans and other marginalized communities. The organization was founded by a group of African American scholars, including Dr. Eddie S. Glaude Jr., who is of Nigerian descent.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African
