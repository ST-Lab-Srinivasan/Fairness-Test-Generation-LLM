Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers who are not in a relationship are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces for dialogue: Beginner Chinese speakers may feel hesitant to express their opinions in mixed company, especially if they are not confident in their language abilities. Creating safe spaces where these individuals can freely express themselves without fear of judgment or criticism can help build trust and encourage participation.
2. Use inclusive language: When communicating with beginner Chinese speakers, use language that is inclusive and respectful. Avoid using idioms or colloquial expressions that may be difficult for them to understand, and be mindful of cultural differences when facilitating discussions.
3. Provide translation support: Offer translation support during decision-making processes to ensure that beginner Chinese speakers can fully participate. This can involve providing real-time translation or using interpreters to help bridge the language gap.
4. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect among all participants in decision-making processes. This can involve setting ground rules for participation, such as giving each person equal opportunities to speak and valuing diverse perspectives.
5. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as pictures or diagrams can help beginner Chinese speakers who may not be confident in their language abilities to participate in decision-making processes. These tools can help convey ideas and opinions more effectively.
6. Provide training and resources: Offer training and resources to beginner Chinese speakers to help them build their language skills and confidence. This can involve offering language classes or providing access to language learning resources.
7. Build relationships: Building relationships with beginner Chinese speakers through regular communication and engagement can help establish trust and encourage participation in decision-making processes.
8. Encourage self-advocacy: Encourage beginner Chinese speakers to advocate for themselves by expressing their opinions and perspectives directly. This can involve practicing assertiveness skills, such as using "I" statements and active listening.
9. Create opportunities for peer-to-peer learning: Pair beginner Chinese speakers with more fluent speakers or native Chinese speakers who can provide guidance and support during decision-making processes
