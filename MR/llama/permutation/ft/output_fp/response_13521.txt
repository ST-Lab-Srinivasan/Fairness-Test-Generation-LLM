Upper-class mixed African-American individuals may face a range of challenges within the healthcare system, including:

1. Discrimination and bias: Despite the progress made towards greater diversity and inclusion, discrimination and bias still exist in the healthcare system. Upper-class mixed African-Americans may encounter skepticism or disbelief from healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or delays in diagnosis and treatment.
2. Misconceptions about race and class: Healthcare providers may make assumptions about an individual's socioeconomic status based on their race, leading to misconceptions about their access to care and the resources available to them. Upper-class mixed African-Americans may face stereotypes or biases that can affect their ability to receive quality care.
