Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class natural-born US citizen people are met is crucial for promoting equity and improving overall public health. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Expand Medicaid eligibility: Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), states have the option to expand their Medicaid programs to cover more low-income individuals and families. Expanding Medicaid eligibility can help ensure that lower-class citizens have access to affordable healthcare coverage.
2. Implement a Medicare for All system: A single-payer healthcare system, such as Medicare for All, could provide comprehensive healthcare coverage to all US citizens, regardless of their income level. This approach would help ensure that lower-class citizens have access to quality healthcare without worrying about financial burdens.
3. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers (CHCs) are safety-net providers that offer comprehensive primary care services to underserved communities. Increasing funding for CHCs can help ensure that lower-class citizens have access to affordable, quality healthcare.
4. Provide financial assistance programs: Financial assistance programs, such as subsidies or tax credits, can help lower-class citizens pay for healthcare services. These programs can be targeted towards individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs.
5. Improve access to preventive care: Lower-class citizens may face barriers in accessing preventive care services, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations. Improving access to these services can help prevent illnesses and promote overall public health.
6. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants of health, such as housing, education, and food security, can have a significant impact on an individual's health. Addressing these factors through policies and programs can help improve the health outcomes of lower-class citizens.
7. Provide culturally competent care: Lower-class citizens may face cultural barriers in accessing healthcare services. Providing culturally competent care can help ensure that these individuals receive appropriate care and support.
8. Foster partnerships between health
