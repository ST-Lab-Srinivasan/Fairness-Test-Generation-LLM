Ensuring that the healthcare needs of low-income Nigerians are met is a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that could be implemented to improve access to healthcare for this population:

1. Increase funding for healthcare: The Nigerian government should prioritize increasing funding for healthcare, particularly in low-income areas.
