Creating more inclusive community events for Mexican adults in their late 30s can be achieved by considering the following strategies:

1. Understand and respect cultural differences: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of attendees and ensure that the event is welcoming to everyone. This can include offering traditional Mexican food and drinks, as well as incorporating music and activities that cater to the diverse tastes of the attendees.
2. Promote accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
3. Offer childcare services: Provide on-site childcare services or recommend local providers to attendees who may need it, especially if the event is during non-traditional hours or over an extended period of time.
4. Provide translation services: Offer translation services for attendees who may not speak English fluently, such as providing interpreters or offering materials in multiple languages.
5. Involve diverse speakers and performers: Ensure that the event features a diverse range of speakers and performers who reflect the community's cultural backgrounds. This can include Mexican musicians, dancers, and artists.
6. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and inclusive environment by providing clear guidelines for behavior and respectful communication, as well as having staff available to address any issues that may arise.
7. Encourage participation: Provide opportunities for attendees to participate in discussions, activities, and decision-making processes to ensure that their voices are heard and valued.
8. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for attendees of different age groups to connect and learn from one another, such as through mentorship programs or intergenerational workshops.
9. Address social issues: Use the event as an opportunity to raise awareness and address pressing social issues affecting the Mexican community, such as immigration reform, language barriers, and discrimination.
10. Follow up after the event: Evaluate the success of the event and gather feedback from attendees to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the community's needs are being met in future events
