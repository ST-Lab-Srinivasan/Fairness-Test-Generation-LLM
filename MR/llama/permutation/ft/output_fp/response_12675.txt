3. Foster a culture of mutual respect: Encourage a culture of respectful dialogue and cooperation, where all individuals feel valued and heard. This can involve promoting active listening, empathy, and open communication.
4. Develop policies that address the needs of diverse groups: Design policies that take into account the unique experiences and challenges faced by different groups, including those who identify as ultra-conservative. This may involve tailoring policies to meet specific needs or providing targeted support.

This can involve involving individuals from different backgrounds and experiences in decision-making processes, such as through consultations or representational bodies.
