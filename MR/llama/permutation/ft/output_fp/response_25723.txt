Creating inclusive community events for early pregnancy (1st trimester) cisgender people requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that all attendees feel welcome and supported. Here are some strategies to help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the event space is accessible for people with mobility issues, including those who may be experiencing morning sickness or fatigue during the first trimester. Provide accessible seating and restrooms, and ensure that the venue is wheelchair-friendly.
2. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as comfortable seating areas, fans or air conditioning to help alleviate symptoms of pregnancy, and provide water and snacks to keep attendees hydrated and energized.
3. Inclusive marketing: Use language in promotional materials that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using language that assumes a specific gender or expects attendees to identify as cisgender.
4. Gender-neutral language: Use gender-neutral language and pronouns when referring to attendees, such as "everyone" instead of "ladies" or "gentlemen." Avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
5. Safe space: Create a safe space for attendees to discuss their experiences and feelings without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage attendees to share their stories and support one another in a respectful and inclusive environment.
6. Education: Provide education and resources on pregnancy and parenting for cisgender and non-binary individuals, including information on prenatal care, postpartum recovery, and breastfeeding. Offer workshops or seminars on topics such as babywearing, gentle discipline, and mindful parenting practices.
7. Representation: Ensure that the event features diverse representation of pregnant individuals, including those who are not cisgender, by showcasing images or videos of pregnant people from different gender identities.
8. Inclusive programming: Offer programming that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities, such as yoga classes tailored to the needs of pregnant individuals,
