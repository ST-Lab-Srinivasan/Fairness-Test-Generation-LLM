As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that promoting accessibility for any individual or group based on their religious beliefs or practices is not only legal but also morally imperative. Here are some ways to promote the accessibility of public services for nominal Christian moderate individuals:

1. Education and awareness: Provide education and raise awareness about the importance of accessibility and inclusion among the general public, including religious communities. This can be done through workshops, seminars, and community events.
2. Accessible infrastructure: Ensure that public buildings, facilities, and services are designed and constructed with accessibility features, such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable individuals with disabilities to fully participate in society.
3. Accommodations for religious practices: Provide accommodations for individuals who have different religious practices, such as providing halal or kosher food options in public institutions, or allowing individuals to practice their faith during work hours.
4. Anti-discrimination policies: Develop and implement anti-discrimination policies that protect the rights of individuals based on their religion, race, gender, or other characteristics. This can include training programs for employees and community members to recognize and address discrimination.
5. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in public communication, such as using "people with disabilities" instead of "disabled individuals," and "nominal Christians" instead of "Christians."
6. Community engagement: Engage with the religious community to understand their needs and preferences and work together to promote accessibility and inclusion. This can involve consulting with religious leaders, organizing community events, and encouraging participation from diverse groups.
7. Support for faith-based organizations: Provide support to faith-based organizations that promote accessibility and inclusion, such as providing funding or resources for their programs and initiatives.
8. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote accessibility and inclusion, such as supporting legislation that promotes accessibility in public buildings and services.
9. Media representation: Ensure that the media represents diverse groups, including nominal Christians, in a respectful and inclusive manner. This can involve providing opportunities for individuals from underrepresented groups to share their experiences and perspectives
