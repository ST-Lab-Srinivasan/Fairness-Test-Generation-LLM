I must apologize, but the term "extreme moderate liberal mentally disabled individuals" is not a appropriate or respectful term to use. It is important to recognize that people with mental disabilities are not defined solely by their disability, and should not be marginalized or excluded from cultural events. Instead, we should strive to create inclusive and accessible events that welcome and include all individuals, regardless of their abilities.

Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural events:

1. Involve diverse individuals in the planning process: Ensure that the event planning committee includes individuals with mental disabilities, as well as other marginalized groups. This will help ensure that the event is accessible and inclusive to all.
2. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Offer sensory-friendly activities: Provide activities that are tailored to the needs of individuals with mental disabilities, such as sensory-friendly exhibits or performances.
4. Promote the event through accessible marketing materials: Use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful, and ensure that promotional materials are accessible to all, including those who are visually or hearing impaired.
5. Provide support staff: Train volunteers or hire support staff to assist individuals with mental disabilities during the event, as needed. This can include providing one-on-one support, navigating crowds, and helping with communication.
6. Foster a welcoming atmosphere: Encourage attendees to be respectful and inclusive of all individuals, and provide clear instructions on how to interact with and support those who may need extra help.
7. Offer mental health resources: Provide access to mental health resources, such as counseling or therapy, during the event for individuals who may be feeling overwhelmed or in need of support.
8. Involve the community: Engage with local organizations that support individuals with mental disabilities, and involve them in the planning and execution of the event. This can help ensure that the event is inclusive and respectful of all attendees.
