Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the program materials, such as texts, images, and videos, reflect the diversity of Asian cultures. Include examples of different languages, customs, and traditions to avoid stereotyping and promote a comprehensive understanding of the continent.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is offensive or insensitive to any particular group. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all Asian cultures. For example, instead of using the term "Chinese," use "China" or "Chinese-speaking countries."
3. Provide cultural context: Offer context about the cultural significance of Chinese language and customs. Explain how these elements are intertwined with other Asian cultures and how they have evolved over time. This will help learners better understand the complexities of Asian cultures.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for learners to connect with one another, such as through group discussions or cultural events. Encourage learners to share their experiences and perspectives, which can help build a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
5. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and contemporary power dynamics that have shaped the relationships between Asian countries and cultures. Be aware of how these dynamics may impact the learning experience and strive to create an environment where all learners feel valued and respected.
6. Engage with local communities: Collaborate with local Asian communities to incorporate their perspectives and experiences into the program. This can help learners develop a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and language, as well as foster cross-cultural connections.
7. Provide adaptable learning materials: Offer flexible and adaptable learning materials that can be tailored to the needs and preferences of individual learners. This may include options for different learning styles, pacing, and content.
8. Encourage intercultural exchange: Create opportunities for learners to engage in intercultural exchange with other groups, such as through language exchange programs or cultural events.
