As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "mid-50s" is not a protected classification under federal anti-discrimination laws in the United States.

1. Lack of representation: Native Americans often face barriers to accessing legal services, particularly in rural areas where there may be a lack of available lawyers who specialize in tribal law or federal Indian law. This can result in limited access to justice for Native Americans.
