Ensuring that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are African-American, are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to create an inclusive and equitable environment. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space for beginners: Establish a welcoming and supportive environment where beginner French speakers feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This could involve setting aside dedicated time for beginners to discuss issues and concerns, or creating a peer-to-peer mentoring program to help them build confidence in their language skills.
2. Provide language support: Offer language support services such as tutoring, language exchange programs, or access to language learning resources to help beginner French speakers improve their language proficiency. This can help them feel more confident and capable of participating in decision-making processes.
3. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage an environment where everyone feels valued and respected, regardless of their language level or background. Promote diversity and inclusion by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences, and creating opportunities for beginners to share their thoughts and ideas.
4. Use accessible language: When communicating with beginner French speakers, use simple and clear language that they can understand. Avoid using complex vocabulary or jargon that may be difficult for them to comprehend.
5. Build relationships: Take the time to get to know beginner French speakers as individuals, and build relationships based on mutual respect and trust. This can help create a sense of belonging and encourage them to participate more actively in decision-making processes.
6. Provide opportunities for participation: Offer beginner French speakers opportunities to participate in discussions, debates, or decision-making processes related to issues that affect their lives. This could involve creating a forum or platform where they can share their thoughts and opinions, or inviting them to attend meetings or events where they can contribute their perspectives.
7. Address power dynamics: Be aware of the potential power imbalances that may exist between beginner French speakers and more proficient speakers, and work to address these dynamics in decision-making processes. This could involve creating mechanisms for beginners to have a voice without being dominated by more proficient speakers.
