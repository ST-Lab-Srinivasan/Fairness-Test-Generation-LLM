Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently single beginner English speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society. For individuals who are newly single and learning English, their cultural heritage can impact their sense of self and identity in several ways:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and connection to one's community and roots.
