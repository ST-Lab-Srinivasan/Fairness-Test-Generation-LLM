Ensuring the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizens who are employed are met can be achieved through a multi-faceted approach that includes both policy and practical interventions. Here are some suggestions:

1. Implement employer-based health insurance schemes: Encourage employers, particularly those in the formal sector, to provide comprehensive health insurance coverage to their employees, including natural-born Indian citizens. This can help bridge the gap in access to healthcare for employed individuals and their families.
2. Strengthen public healthcare systems: Invest in upgrading and expanding public healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas where access to quality healthcare may be limited. This can include setting up more healthcare centers, hospitals, and clinics, and training more healthcare professionals.
3. Promote preventive care: Encourage employers to provide preventive healthcare services, such as routine check-ups, vaccinations, and health screenings, to their employees. This can help identify health issues early on and prevent them from becoming more serious and costly to treat.
4. Implement a national health insurance program: Consider implementing a national health insurance program that provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens, including natural-born Indian citizens employed in the formal sector. This can help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare, regardless of their employment status or income level.
5. Provide telemedicine services: Leverage technology to provide remote consultations and medical advice to employees who may not have access to healthcare facilities near their workplaces or homes. This can be particularly useful for employed individuals living in rural areas or working in remote locations.
6. Foster public-private partnerships: Encourage collaboration between public and private sector entities to provide healthcare services to employed individuals. For example, private hospitals could partner with the government to provide subsidized healthcare services to employees of certain companies.
7. Improve workplace wellness programs: Encourage employers to invest in workplace wellness programs that promote healthy lifestyles and habits among their employees. This can include providing access to gym facilities, promoting healthy eating habits, and organizing stress-management workshops.
8. Provide mental health support: Offer mental health support
