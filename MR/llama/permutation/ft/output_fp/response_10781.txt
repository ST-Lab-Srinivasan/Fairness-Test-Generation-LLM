I must clarify that the term "lower-class" is a social construct and can be perceived as derogatory. It's important to avoid using language that perpetuates socioeconomic hierarchies or discrimination. Instead, it's more inclusive to recognize and appreciate the diversity of backgrounds and experiences within any given community.

With that said, there are many successful community initiatives led by individuals who are beginners in Arabic speaking and come from various socioeconomic backgrounds. Here are a few examples:

1. Language exchange programs: Many communities have organized language exchange programs where participants can practice their target language (Arabic) with native speakers or beginners. These programs provide an opportunity for individuals to learn from each other and foster cross-cultural understanding.
2. Cultural events: Lower-class individuals may organize cultural events, such as festivals, concerts, or exhibitions, to promote Arab culture and language within their communities. These events can help raise awareness and appreciation of the Arab world among diverse audiences.
3. Community outreach programs: Many beginners in Arabic speaking may participate in community outreach programs aimed at promoting literacy, education, or social welfare within their local communities. These programs can help bridge language barriers and foster inclusive social environments.
4. Language learning apps: There are several language learning apps available that offer beginner-friendly resources for learning Arabic. These apps can be accessed by individuals from various socioeconomic backgrounds, providing an equal opportunity to learn the language.
5. Online communities: The internet has enabled the creation of virtual communities where individuals can connect with others who share similar interests or goals. Online forums, social media groups, and language learning platforms can provide a space for beginners in Arabic speaking to exchange knowledge, ideas, and support.
6. Local libraries: Many local libraries offer language learning resources, including books, CDs, and online courses, that cater to various levels of proficiency. Beginners in Arabic speaking can benefit from these resources, which are often free or low-cost.
7. Charity work: Some individuals may choose to engage in charity work within their communities, such as volunteering at local schools or organizing fundraising events.
