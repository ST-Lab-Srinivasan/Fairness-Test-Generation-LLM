Addressing the specific needs of ethnically full African-American widowed individuals in higher education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies that can help address the needs of this population:

1. Cultural Competence Training: Provide training on cultural competence for faculty, staff, and administrators to help them understand the specific needs and experiences of African-American widowed students. This training can include workshops on cultural humility, microaggressions, and how to create an inclusive environment.
2. Mentorship Programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair African-American widowed students with successful alumni or faculty members who understand their experiences and can provide guidance and support. These mentors can offer advice on navigating academic and social challenges, as well as provide emotional support.
3. Support Groups: Offer support groups specifically for African-American widowed students. These groups can provide a safe space for students to share their experiences, connect with peers, and receive emotional support. Group facilitators should be trained in cultural competence and trauma-informed care.
4. Academic and Financial Support: Provide academic and financial support specifically tailored to the needs of African-American widowed students. This can include scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid that are available only to this population. Additionally, academic departments can offer extra support and resources for students who may be struggling academically due to their life circumstances.
5. Campus Resources: Make sure that there are resources available on campus specifically for African-American widowed students. This can include counseling services, academic advising, and other forms of support. These resources should be marketed directly to this population and should be staffed by culturally competent professionals.
6. Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives: Develop initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion on campus, such as cultural events, workshops, and training programs. These initiatives can help create a more inclusive environment for African-American widowed students and foster a sense of belonging.
7. Outreach and Recruitment: Engage in targeted outreach and recruitment efforts to attract more African-American widowed students to the college or university.
