Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the needs of various segments of society, including those below the poverty line and newly married individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Listen to marginalized communities: It is essential to listen to the voices of marginalized communities, understand their challenges, and involve them in the policy-making process. This can be done through community engagement and participation mechanisms.
2. Address poverty: Poverty is a significant factor that affects many individuals and families. Policies should focus on reducing poverty by providing financial support, job training programs, and opportunities for employment.
3. Support education: Education is a critical factor in breaking the cycle of poverty. Social policies should prioritize accessible and quality education for all, including marginalized communities.
4. Improve healthcare access: Ensuring access to quality healthcare is crucial for vulnerable populations. Policies should aim to improve healthcare services, address health disparities, and provide affordable healthcare options.
5. Promote gender equality: Gender inequality persists in many societies, leading to unequal access to resources and opportunities. Social policies should prioritize gender equality by promoting women's empowerment, challenging patriarchal norms, and addressing gender-based violence.
6. Foster inclusive economic growth: Economic growth should be inclusive, creating opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Policies can achieve this by investing in infrastructure, promoting entrepreneurship, and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
7. Address discrimination: Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation continues to be a significant barrier to inclusive social policies. Policies should aim to address these forms of discrimination by promoting diversity and inclusion.
8. Encourage intergenerational equity: Social policies should prioritize intergenerational equity by providing opportunities for young people, ensuring their access to education and job training, and addressing the wealth gap between generations.
9. Foster community cohesion: Building strong communities is essential for inclusive social policies
