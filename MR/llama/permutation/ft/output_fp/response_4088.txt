As a beginner Spanish speaker and recent immigrant to the US, individuals may face various challenges when navigating the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Limited proficiency in English can make it difficult for immigrants to communicate effectively with healthcare providers, understand medical instructions, and access necessary medical care.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultural norms and beliefs about health and illness can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between healthcare providers and immigrant patients.
3. Lack of knowledge about the US healthcare system: Immigrants may be unfamiliar with the structure and organization of the US healthcare system, making it difficult for them to navigate the system and access necessary care.
