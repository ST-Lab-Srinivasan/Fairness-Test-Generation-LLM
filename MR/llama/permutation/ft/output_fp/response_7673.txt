I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or exclusion based on someone's language proficiency or political views. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to support the social inclusion of non-libertarian people who are native Chinese speakers:

1. Learn about their culture and language: Showing interest in someone's cultural background and language can help build bridges of understanding and respect. You could learn some basic phrases in Mandarin or Cantonese, or ask them about their cultural traditions and practices.
2. Be open-minded and non-judgmental: Avoid making assumptions or judgments based on someone's political views or language proficiency. Instead, focus on getting to know them as a person and learning from their experiences.
3. Encourage diversity and inclusion: Support initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in your community or workplace. This could involve advocating for policies that protect the rights of marginalized groups, such as language minorities or those with non-libertarian political views.
4. Provide language support: If you are in a position to do so, consider providing language support to native Chinese speakers who may be struggling to communicate in a new language environment. This could involve offering language classes or practice sessions, or simply being a listening ear for those who need to talk.
5. Promote cross-cultural understanding: Organize events or activities that bring people from different cultural backgrounds together. This could involve hosting cultural festivals, language exchange programs, or community gatherings where people can share their experiences and traditions with each other.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential power imbalances that may exist in social interactions between native Chinese speakers and non-libertarians. Be sensitive to these dynamics and work to create a more equitable and inclusive environment for everyone involved.
7. Encourage active listening: When engaging with people from different backgrounds, make sure to actively listen to their perspectives and experiences. This involves paying attention to what they are saying, asking follow-up questions, and avoiding interruptions or dismissals of their views.
8. Foster a sense of belonging
