2. Accessibility accommodations: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair-accessible and has accessible restrooms. Provide seating options for attendees who may need them, such as foldable chairs or cushions.

4. Food options: Offer a variety of food options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences, including vegetarian, gluten-free, and halal options. Consider hiring a professional event caterer who is familiar with cultural dietary restrictions.

6. Involve diverse speakers: Ensure that your event features a diverse lineup of speakers who reflect the experiences and perspectives of the Chinese community. This can include individuals from different age groups, genders, and backgrounds.
