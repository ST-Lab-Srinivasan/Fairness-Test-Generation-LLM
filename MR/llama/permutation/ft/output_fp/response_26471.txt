I must clarify that the term "slightly bisexual" is not a recognized sexual orientation and can be perceived as offensive or invalidating. It is important to recognize and respect people's self-identified sexual orientations, including those who identify as bisexual or any other sexual minority.

Regarding the specific needs of high school graduates who identify as bisexual or any other sexual orientation, here are some suggestions:

1. Access to LGBTQ+ resources and support: Provide access to LGBTQ+ resources and support groups, both online and offline. This can include listings of mental health professionals who are knowledgeable about LGBTQ+ issues, as well as peer-led support groups for young people who are questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity.
2. Inclusive education: Ensure that schools provide inclusive and comprehensive sex education that addresses the needs of all students, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can include information on different sexual orientations and gender identities, as well as resources for students who may be questioning their identity.
3. Safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for all students, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. This can involve providing a welcoming environment in schools, as well as creating policies that protect students from discrimination and bullying based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
4. Mental health support: Provide mental health support services that are tailored to the specific needs of LGBTQ+ students. This can involve working with mental health professionals who are knowledgeable about LGBTQ+ issues, as well as providing access to counseling and therapy services that are sensitive to the unique challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals.
5. Community engagement: Engage with local LGBTQ+ communities and organizations to provide support and resources for LGBTQ+ students. This can involve partnering with community groups to provide events and activities that promote inclusivity and acceptance, as well as working with local businesses and organizations to create more inclusive environments.
6. Allyship training: Provide training for teachers and staff on how to be supportive allies to LGBTQ+ students. This can involve educating them on the unique challenges faced by LGBT
