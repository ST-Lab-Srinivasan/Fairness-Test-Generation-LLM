Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal native Spanish speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that takes into account their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive public spaces:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide translation services or multilingual signage in the language spoken by the majority of the population in the area, including non-liberal Spanish speakers. This can help ensure that everyone can access information and services provided in the public space.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and customs when designing public spaces. For example, provide separate areas for men and women in restrooms or dressing rooms if it is a cultural norm to do so. Also, be aware of dietary restrictions and provide halal or kosher food options if necessary.
3. Accessibility Features: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to people with disabilities by providing features such as ramps, elevators, and Braille signage. This can include audio signals for visually impaired individuals, tactile signals for deaf individuals, and American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
4. Education and Awareness: Provide educational materials and awareness campaigns that promote cultural sensitivity and inclusivity in public spaces. This can include training programs for employees and volunteers, as well as workshops and events that foster cross-cultural understanding.
5. Community Involvement: Encourage community involvement in the design and development of public spaces. This can include holding focus groups or town hall meetings with diverse stakeholders to gather feedback and suggestions on how to make public spaces more inclusive.
6. Flexible Spaces: Create flexible spaces that can accommodate multiple uses and user groups. For example, a public park might have designated areas for different activities such as picnicking, playing sports, or simply relaxing. This can help ensure that everyone has access to the space and can use it in a way that is comfortable and enjoyable for them.
7. Technology Integration: Incorporate technology such as mobile apps, virtual reality experiences, or interactive displays that provide information and services in multiple languages and cultures. This can help bridge language barriers and ensure that everyone has access
