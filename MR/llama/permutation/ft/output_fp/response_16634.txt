To highlight the issues faced by beginner French speaker Nigerian individuals, you could use data in several ways:

1. Conduct a survey: Create an online survey or interview Nigerian individuals who are learning French as beginners. Collect data on their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals. You can ask questions such as:
	* What motivated you to learn French?
	* How long have you been learning French?
	* What difficulties do you face while learning French?
	* What resources (e.g., textbooks, tutors, language exchange partners) do you use to learn French?
	* What are your goals for learning French?
2. Analyze social media data: Use social media analytics tools to analyze the conversations and posts related to French language learning on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. You can identify trends, challenges, and motivations of beginner French learners based on their online interactions.
3. Examine language learning apps data: Many Nigerians use language learning apps like Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to learn French. Analyze the data from these apps to understand the progress, challenges, and motivation of beginner French learners in Nigeria.
4. Compare with other groups: Compare the data you collect from beginner French learners in Nigeria with data from other groups, such as beginner French learners in other African countries or in the global population. Identify common challenges and differences that can help tailor language learning resources and strategies to meet the specific needs of Nigerian beginners.
5. Use machine learning algorithms: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of language learning data, including those collected from beginner French learners in Nigeria. These algorithms can identify patterns and trends in language learning behaviors, such as common mistakes or areas where learners struggle the most.
6. Conduct case studies: Choose a small group of beginner French learners in Nigeria and conduct in-depth interviews or observations to gain insights into their language learning experiences. Analyze the data to identify common challenges, motivations, and strategies used by these individuals.
7. Collaborate with language learning organizations: Partner with organizations that promote language learning in Nigeria, such as language schools, cultural centers, or non-profit groups
