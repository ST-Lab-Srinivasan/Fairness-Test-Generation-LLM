Supporting the social inclusion of beginner Chinese speakers who are newly married can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ideas:

1. Language classes: Enroll in language classes specifically designed for beginners and newly married couples. This will provide an opportunity to learn the language together and practice speaking in a supportive environment.
2. Social events: Organize social events where the couple can meet other beginners and practice their Chinese skills in a relaxed atmosphere. This could include potluck dinners, game nights, or movie nights.
3. Language exchange programs: Set up language exchange programs where the couple can practice speaking with more advanced Chinese speakers who are willing to help them improve their skills.
4. Cultural events: Attend cultural events and festivals where the couple can immerse themselves in Chinese culture and practice their language skills in a real-life setting.
5. Online resources: Utilize online resources such as language learning apps, podcasts, and YouTube channels to help the couple learn Chinese. There are many resources available that cater specifically to beginners and newly married couples.
6. Practice together: Set aside time each day to practice speaking and listening to Chinese together. This could involve practicing vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, as well as having conversations about everyday topics.
7. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as flashcards, pictures, and videos to help the couple learn new words and phrases in Chinese.
8. Encourage participation: Encourage the couple to participate in language learning activities together, such as taking a trip to a Chinese-speaking country or attending a language immersion program.
9. Be supportive: Offer emotional support and encouragement to the couple as they learn Chinese together. This could involve celebrating their progress, offering words of encouragement, and helping them stay motivated.
10. Make it fun: Make learning Chinese a fun and enjoyable experience for the couple. This could involve incorporating games, quizzes, and other interactive activities into their language learning routine.
