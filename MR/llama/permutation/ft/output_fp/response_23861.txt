People living in deep poverty during their third trimester of pregnancy face significant challenges in accessing justice within the legal system. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

1. Limited access to legal representation: Deeply poor individuals may not be able to afford legal representation, which can limit their ability to navigate the complexities of the legal system and advocate for themselves.
2. Lack of knowledge about legal rights: Many people living in poverty may not have a comprehensive understanding of their legal rights and entitlements, making it difficult for them to assertively advocate for themselves.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Deeply poor individuals may not have access to the necessary legal resources, such as libraries or legal clinics, to research and prepare their cases.

5. Language barriers: Individuals with limited English proficiency may face additional challenges in accessing the legal system, as many legal resources and documents are only available in English.
6. Limited mobility: People living in poverty may have limited mobility due to lack of transportation or other factors, which can make it difficult for them to access legal services or courts located in distant areas.
7. Stigma and shame: Living in deep poverty can lead to feelings of stigma and shame, which can further marginalize individuals and limit their ability to seek help from the legal system.

9. Limited access to information and communication technology: Individuals living in deep poverty may not have access to necessary information and communication technologies, such as computers or smartphones, to research and prepare their cases.
10. Fear of retaliation: People living in poverty may fear retaliation from those in power if they seek legal recourse, which can further limit their ability to access justice.
