I must clarify that the term "native Arabic speaker" can be perceived as a racial or ethnic categorization, which may not accurately reflect the diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds of individuals within the Arab world. Additionally, the assumption that all native Arabic speakers are Buddhist is also not accurate, as there are many Muslims, Christians, Jews, and other religious groups within the Arab world.

That being said, if we are to assume that the question refers to legal challenges faced by individuals who are native Arabic speakers and practice Buddhism, here are some potential challenges:

This can be particularly difficult if they are not familiar with the legal requirements or procedures for proving religious affiliation.

For example, they may be required to testify in court against a fellow Buddhist, which could be seen as a violation of their religious beliefs.
7. Lack of representation: Native Arabic speakers who practice Buddhism may have limited access to legal representation due to language barriers or
