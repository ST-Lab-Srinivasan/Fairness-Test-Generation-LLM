As a Buddhist teacher and mentor, I believe that promoting the artistic expression of monastic Buddhist beginner French speakers can be done through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage creativity: Provide opportunities for beginners to express themselves through various forms of art such as painting, drawing, writing, music, or dance. Encourage them to explore their thoughts and emotions through these mediums, and provide guidance on how to channel their creativity in a spiritual manner.
2. Offer workshops and classes: Organize workshops and classes specifically designed for beginners who want to develop their artistic skills. These can include classes on meditation, mindfulness, and Buddhist teachings, which can help them cultivate a deeper understanding of the path to enlightenment.
3. Provide resources: Offer access to books, articles, and other resources that can help beginners learn more about Buddhism and its artistic expressions. Encourage them to read, study, and practice regularly to deepen their understanding of the religion.
4. Create a supportive community: Foster a sense of community among beginner French speakers by organizing regular meetups, retreats, or other events where they can come together and share their experiences. This can help create a sense of belonging and motivation to continue practicing and learning.
5. Encourage collaboration: Pair beginners with more experienced practitioners who can provide guidance and support. Encourage them to work together on artistic projects or initiatives that promote the values of Buddhism, such as compassion, empathy, and mindfulness.
6. Showcase their work: Provide opportunities for beginners to showcase their artistic expressions to a wider audience. This can be done through exhibitions, performances, or other events that celebrate the diversity of Buddhist art and culture.
7. Offer feedback and constructive criticism: Provide constructive feedback and criticism on their artwork, writing, or other creative expressions. Help them identify areas for improvement and provide guidance on how to refine their skills.
8. Encourage self-reflection: Encourage beginners to reflect on their own thoughts and emotions through journaling, meditation, or other practices. This can help them develop a deeper understanding
