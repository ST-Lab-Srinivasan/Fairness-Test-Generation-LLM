The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of over 90 years old active-duty people can be significant and far-reaching. These individuals may face a range of challenges that can affect their physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Reduced mobility and independence: Genetic conditions can lead to musculoskeletal problems, such as arthritis or muscular dystrophy, which can limit a person's ability to move around freely and perform daily tasks independently. This can result in increased reliance on others for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).
2. Chronic pain: Many genetic conditions can cause chronic pain, which can significantly impact an older adult's quality of life. Pain can limit a person's ability to engage in physical activity, socialize, or enjoy leisure activities, and can also affect their mood and mental health.
3. Fatigue: Genetic conditions can cause fatigue, which can make it difficult for older adults to perform daily tasks or maintain their usual level of activity. This can lead to a decrease in physical functioning and an increased risk of falls or other accidents.
4. Cognitive impairment: Some genetic conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia, can cause cognitive decline and memory loss, which can impact an older adult's ability to manage their daily affairs, make decisions, or maintain their independence.
5. Emotional distress: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging for older adults, particularly if they are struggling with the physical or cognitive symptoms associated with the condition. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, or isolation.
6. Social isolation: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to their physical limitations or cognitive impairment, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection from others.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Genetic conditions can sometimes be stigmatized or misunderstood by the general public, leading to discrimination or social exclusion. This can further affect an
