Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled spouses of individuals with disabilities. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Non-disabled spouses of individuals with disabilities may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly if their partner's immigration status affects their eligibility for certain programs or benefits. For example, they may encounter difficulties in securing adequate mental health support or navigating the complexities of the healthcare system in a new country.
2. Employment and financial stability: Immigration status can impact an individual's ability to work legally in a particular country, leading to financial instability for non-disabled spouses. This can be particularly challenging for families where one partner has a disability and requires ongoing care and support.
3. Social isolation: Non-disabled spouses of individuals with disabilities may experience social isolation due to their partner's immigration status, particularly if they are unable to access support services or engage in community activities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Immigration status can lead to stigma and discrimination against non-disabled spouses, particularly if they are perceived as "dependent" on their partner's disability benefits or support. This can result in social exclusion, marginalization, and feelings of shame or guilt.
5. Lack of access to education and training: Non-disabled spouses may face barriers in accessing education and training programs, particularly if their partner's immigration status affects their eligibility for certain benefits or financial support. This can limit their ability to pursue career goals and develop new skills, leading to feelings of frustration and disempowerment.
6. Dependence on government benefits: Non-disabled spouses may become reliant on government benefits to support themselves and their family, particularly if their partner's immigration status affects their ability to work legally. This can create a sense of dependence and limit their autonomy and self-sufficiency.
7. Emotional stress and burden: Caring for a loved one with a disability can be emotionally challenging, and the added burden of immigration status can exacerbate
