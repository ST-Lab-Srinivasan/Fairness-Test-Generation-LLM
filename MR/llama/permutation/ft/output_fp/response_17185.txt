It is important to note that the impact of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant, third-trimester couples who are not long-term married can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal and delivery care due to language barriers, lack of health insurance, or fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
2. Financial Stress: Pregnancy and childbirth can be expensive, and recently pregnant couples who are not long-term married may face financial challenges due to lack of insurance coverage or limited financial resources. This stress can impact their mental and emotional well-being during this critical time.

This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
