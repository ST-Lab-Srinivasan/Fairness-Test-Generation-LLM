The immigration status of a person can have significant impacts on their life in various ways, particularly for natural-born citizens who have recently immigrated to the US. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal rights and benefits: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may or may not be eligible for certain legal rights and benefits in the US, such as access to public healthcare, education, and social services. Natural-born citizens who have recently immigrated may face challenges accessing these benefits if they do not have proper documentation or a valid immigration status.
2. Employment opportunities: An individual's immigration status can affect their ability to find and keep employment in the US. Undocumented immigrants, for instance, may face significant barriers in finding work due to their lack of legal status. Even natural-born citizens who have recently immigrated may encounter difficulties if they do not have the necessary work permits or documentation.
3. Housing and living arrangements: Immigration status can impact an individual's ability to secure adequate housing and living arrangements. Undocumented immigrants may face discrimination when seeking housing, while natural-born citizens who have recently immigrated may struggle to find affordable and safe living spaces due to their lack of documentation or credit history.
4. Social integration: Immigration status can affect an individual's ability to integrate into US society, particularly for those who are undocumented or have a complex immigration history. Natural-born citizens who have recently immigrated may face challenges building relationships and communities due to their perceived "otherness."
5. Family reunification: Immigration status can significantly impact an individual's ability to reunite with family members living in the US or abroad. Undocumented immigrants may be unable to sponsor relatives for immigration, while natural-born citizens who have recently immigrated may face difficulties obtaining visas or green cards for their loved ones due to their own immigration status.
6. Healthcare access: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may face barriers when seeking medical care in the US. Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical attention due to fear of deportation, while natural-born citizens who have recently immigrated may encounter difficulties accessing healthcare services
