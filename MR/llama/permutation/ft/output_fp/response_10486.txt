I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their political beliefs or affiliations. The legal system is designed to treat all individuals equally and fairly, regardless of their political views. However, there are some challenges that may be faced by children who are strong right-leaning members of the GOP, including:

1. Limited understanding of the legal system: Children may not have a full understanding of the legal system and how it works, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the law.
2. Lack of experience: Children who are strong right-leaning members of the GOP may not have had extensive experience with the legal system, which can make it harder for them to advocate for their beliefs and values within the system.
3. Social and cultural barriers: Children may face social and cultural barriers that can make it difficult for them to express their political views, particularly if they are in a minority within their peer group or community.
4. Limited access to resources: Children may have limited access to resources such as legal representation, which can make it harder for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Children who are strong right-leaning members of the GOP may face stigma or discrimination based on their political beliefs, which can make it difficult for them to feel comfortable expressing themselves within the legal system.

It's important to recognize that these challenges can affect any individual, regardless of their age or political affiliation. It's also important to remember that every person has the right to express their beliefs and values within the legal system, as long as they do so in a respectful and lawful manner.
