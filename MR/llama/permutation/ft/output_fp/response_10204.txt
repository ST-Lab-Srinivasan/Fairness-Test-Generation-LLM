As a moderate liberal, you may face several challenges when navigating the healthcare system as a Native American natural-born US citizen. Here are some of the common issues you might encounter:

1. Lack of culturally sensitive care: Many healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of Native American communities, leading to inadequate or insensitive care.
2. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities face barriers to accessing healthcare due to geographic isolation, lack of transportation, or limited healthcare resources in their area.
3. Language barriers: For many Native Americans, English may not be their first language, which can create communication challenges when trying to navigate the healthcare system.

5. Limited healthcare provider options: Depending on where you live, there may be limited options for healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about Native American cultural practices and beliefs.
6. High cost of care: Many Native Americans face financial barriers to accessing healthcare, which can limit their ability to receive necessary treatments or procedures.
