Ensuring that the voices of physically disabled recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes requires a deliberate and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Build trust and rapport: Establishing a personal connection with individuals is crucial for building trust and understanding their perspectives. Organizations can work with community-based organizations that serve immigrant populations to build relationships and provide support.
2. Use accessible language and communication methods: Ensure that all communication materials, including reports, presentations, and surveys, are available in multiple languages and formats (e.g., braille, large print) to accommodate individuals with different access needs.
3. Provide opportunities for participation: Create spaces where physically disabled recent immigrants can participate in decision-making processes, such as through focus groups, surveys, or community meetings. Offer childcare and transportation support to ensure that all individuals can attend.
4. Foster an inclusive environment: Ensure that decision-making spaces are physically accessible and free from discrimination. This includes providing wheelchair accessibility, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, and other accommodations as needed.
5. Engage with advocacy groups: Collaborate with organizations that represent the interests of physically disabled recent immigrants to amplify their voices in decision-making processes.
6. Develop a diverse advisory committee: Establish an advisory committee consisting of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including physically disabled recent immigrants. This committee can provide guidance and feedback on decisions that affect the immigrant community.
7. Use participatory budgeting: Involve members of the immigrant community in the decision-making process around allocation of resources. This can be done through participatory budgeting processes, where community members can propose and vote on projects and initiatives that address their needs.
8. Provide training and education: Offer training and educational resources to decision-makers and community leaders on disability rights and inclusion. This can help build a more informed and empathetic approach to decision-making.
9. Celebrate diversity: Highlight the contributions and perspectives of physically disabled recent immigrants through events, exhibitions, or other initiatives that celebrate cultural diversity.
