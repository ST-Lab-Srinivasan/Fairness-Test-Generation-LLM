Creating more inclusive community events for people who are grieving the loss of a spouse, particularly those with no known genetic conditions, requires careful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to help make your event more welcoming and accessible:

1. Involve a diverse group of people in the planning process: Ensure that the planning committee represents different ages, cultures, and backgrounds to create a more diverse and inclusive event.
2. Provide accommodations for different needs: Offer a variety of seating options (e.g., chairs, benches, blankets), ensure there are accessible restrooms, and provide wheelchair accessibility if necessary.
