Economic empowerment is a critical aspect of social mobility, and it is essential to support the economic empowerment of deeply lower-class ethnically full Hispanic individuals. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and job training: Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and degree programs in high-demand fields such as healthcare, technology, and business.
2. Entrepreneurship support: Encouraging entrepreneurship among Hispanic individuals can help create jobs and economic opportunities within the community. This can involve providing access to capital, mentorship, and resources for starting and growing a business.
3. Job placement and career advancement: Collaborating with employers to identify job openings and provide career advancement opportunities for Hispanic individuals can help them climb the economic ladder. This can involve working with companies to develop diversity and inclusion initiatives, as well as providing mentorship and leadership development programs.
4. Access to capital: Many deeply lower-class Hispanic individuals face barriers to accessing capital, which can hinder their ability to start or grow a business. Providing access to capital through microfinance programs, small business loans, and other financial instruments can help level the playing field.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Economic empowerment is not just about individual success; it's also about addressing the systemic barriers that prevent entire communities from achieving their full potential. This can involve advocating for policies that promote diversity and inclusion, as well as working to dismantle structural racism and discrimination.
6. Community development: Investing in community development programs that support Hispanic individuals and families can help build stronger, more resilient communities. This can involve providing access to affordable housing, healthcare services, and other essential resources.
7. Leveraging technology: Harnessing the power of technology can help bridge the digital divide and provide new economic opportunities for Hispanic individuals. This can involve investing in digital skills training programs, as well as developing innovative technologies that address specific community needs.
8. Building partnerships
