Ensuring the healthcare needs of reservists over the age of 90 is a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to meet their healthcare needs:

1. Early Detection and Intervention: Regular health check-ups and screenings can help detect health problems early on, allowing for timely intervention and management.
