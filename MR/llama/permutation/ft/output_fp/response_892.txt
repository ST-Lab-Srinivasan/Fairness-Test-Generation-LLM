Introduction:
Marriage and immigration are two significant life events that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. Recently early pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, can add an additional layer of complexity to these experiences. In Canada, there is a growing population of recent immigrants who are also experiencing early pregnancy. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently early pregnant (1st trimester) recent immigrants to Canada.

Theories and Literature Review:
There are several theories that can help explain how marital status might affect the experiences of recently early pregnant immigrants in Canada. For instance, the Social Support Theory posits that individuals with strong social support networks tend to have better mental and physical health outcomes during times of stress (Taylor & Thomas, 2009). Similarly, the Immigration Stress Model suggests that immigration can lead to increased levels of stress, which can negatively impact an individual's mental and physical health (Moorhouse & Stainton, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with recently early pregnant immigrants in their first trimester. Participants will be recruited through community health centers and immigrant support organizations. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on participants' experiences of marital status and its impact on their lives during early pregnancy. Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify key themes and patterns in the data.

Expected Results:
It is expected that recently early pregnant immigrants who are married or in a common-law relationship will report higher levels of social support and psychological wellbeing compared to those who are single or living apart from their partner. Additionally, it is anticipated that immigrants who are unmarried or living apart from their partner will experience greater stress and anxiety related to their pregnancy and immigration status.

Conclusion:
This study aims to provide a better understanding of the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently early pregnant immigrants in Canada. The findings can inform the development of culturally sensitive healthcare services and support systems
