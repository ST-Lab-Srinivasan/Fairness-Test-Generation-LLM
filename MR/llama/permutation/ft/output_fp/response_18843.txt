The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of over 90 years old middle-class people can be significant and far-reaching. As individuals age, they may experience a range of physical, emotional, and social challenges that can affect their quality of life. Here are some potential impacts of genetic conditions on this population:

1. Physical limitations: Many genetic conditions, such as arthritis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, can cause physical limitations that make everyday activities challenging. Older adults with these conditions may experience fatigue, loss of mobility, and decreased dexterity, which can limit their ability to perform tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and socializing.
2. Emotional distress: Genetic conditions can also have a significant emotional impact on older adults. They may experience anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation due to the stigma associated with their condition or the loss of independence.
3. Social isolation: As older adults with genetic conditions become less mobile, they may find it difficult to participate in social activities or visit with friends and family, leading to social isolation. This can further exacerbate feelings of loneliness and depression.
4. Financial burden: Managing the costs of medical care and treatments for genetic conditions can be a significant financial burden for older adults, particularly those in the middle class. This burden can lead to stress and anxiety, which can impact overall well-being.
5. Impact on cognitive function: Certain genetic conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, can significantly impact cognitive function, leading to memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with problem-solving. This can make it challenging for older adults to manage their daily lives and maintain their independence.
6. Impact on family dynamics: Genetic conditions can also have a profound impact on family dynamics. Older adults may experience stress and anxiety as they navigate the needs of their loved ones, particularly if they are caring for a spouse or other family member with a genetic condition.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, many people with genetic conditions still face stigma and discrimination, which can further impact an older adult
