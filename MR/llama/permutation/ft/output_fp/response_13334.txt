Promoting the educational success of native Arabic speaker mentally disabled students requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Adaptation of Curriculum: The curriculum should be adapted to meet the individual needs of each student, taking into account their mental disability and their native Arabic language proficiency.
