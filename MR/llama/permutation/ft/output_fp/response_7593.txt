5. Access to resources: Ensure that they have access to resources such as textbooks, stationery, and other learning materials that they may need to succeed in their studies.
6. Support from peers: Encourage them to interact with their peers who are also in similar situations, which can provide a sense of community and support.
7. Collaboration with NGOs: Collaborate with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that specialize in education for women and girls, which can provide additional resources and support.
8. Community outreach: Reach out to the community to raise awareness about the importance of education for women and girls, and to encourage them to support these efforts.
9. Government support: Advocate with government officials to ensure that policies and programs are in place to support the educational needs of infant female widows.
