I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or respectful to use language that is offensive or discriminatory towards any individual or group, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. All individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, are entitled to the same legal rights and protections under the law.

To ensure that the legal rights of immigrant natural-born US citizens who are strongly homosexual are protected, it is important to:

1. Advocate for comprehensive and inclusive legislation that protects the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can include supporting measures that provide equal protection under the law, prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and ensure access to the same opportunities and resources.
2. Support organizations that provide legal assistance and advocacy services to immigrant LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who may be facing discrimination or harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. These organizations can help provide information, resources, and support to ensure that these individuals are able to access the legal protection they need.
3. Educate oneself and others about the issues and challenges faced by immigrant LGBTQ+ individuals, including the specific legal rights and protections that are relevant to their situation. This can help to raise awareness and promote understanding of the importance of protecting these rights.
4. Engage in advocacy efforts with elected officials and other decision-makers to push for policies and laws that promote equality and inclusivity for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can include participating in campaigns, signing petitions, and using social media to raise awareness about these issues.
5. Support organizations that provide resources and support to immigrant LGBTQ+ individuals, including those that offer legal aid, counseling, and other forms of support. These organizations can help to provide a safe and welcoming environment for individuals who may be facing discrimination or marginalization.

By taking these steps, we can work towards ensuring that the legal rights of immigrant natural-born US citizens who are strongly homosexual are protected, and promoting a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
