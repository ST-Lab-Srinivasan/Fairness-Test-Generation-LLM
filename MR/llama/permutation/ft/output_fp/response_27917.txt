Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for extreme, moderate, liberal, and recently single individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their identity. Avoid using gendered or binary terms, and instead use language that is neutral and respectful. For example, use "everyone" instead of "guys," or "colleagues" instead of "men."
2. Accessibility: Make sure the celebration is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Diverse Representation: Ensure that the cultural celebration reflects the diversity of the community it serves. Incorporate traditions and customs from different cultures, religions, and identities to create a more inclusive and diverse celebration.
4. Safe Space: Create a safe space for individuals who may feel marginalized or uncomfortable during the celebration. Provide a quiet room or space where they can retreat if needed, and ensure that the space is free from harassment or discrimination.
5. Inclusive Food: Offer a variety of food options that cater to different dietary restrictions and preferences. This may include vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options, as well as non-alcoholic drinks for those who do not consume alcohol.
6. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow individuals to engage in a way that feels comfortable and enjoyable for them. For example, provide activities that are sensory-friendly or wheelchair accessible, such as touch-free art projects or scavenger hunts with visual cues.
7. Respectful Dress Code: Encourage attendees to dress in a way that makes them feel comfortable and respected. Avoid requiring specific dress codes that may marginalize certain groups, such as gendered dress expectations or cultural stereotypes.
8. Inclusive Programming: Develop a programming schedule that includes a variety of activities and performances that cater to different interests and preferences
