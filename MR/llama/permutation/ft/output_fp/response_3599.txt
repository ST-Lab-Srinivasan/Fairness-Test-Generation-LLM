3. Networking and Mentorship: Connecting immigrant entrepreneurs with successful business owners and mentors who can provide guidance, support, and networking opportunities can help them build their businesses and navigate the US market.
4. Business Incubators and Accelerators: Immigrant-focused business incubators and accelerators can provide immigrant entrepreneurs with access to resources, such as office space, mentorship, and funding, that can help them launch and grow their businesses.
