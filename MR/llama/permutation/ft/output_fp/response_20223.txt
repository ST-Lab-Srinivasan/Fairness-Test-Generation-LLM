As a multilingual AI model, I can provide you with some general challenges that beginner English speakers and beginner Arabic speakers may face when interacting with the legal system in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Please note that these are common challenges and may vary depending on the specific country and context.

1. Language barriers: The primary challenge faced by beginner English speakers is the language barrier. Arabic is the official language in many MENA countries, and not everyone speaks English fluently. This can make it difficult for non-Arabic speakers to navigate the legal system, understand legal documents, and communicate with lawyers and authorities.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in MENA countries is often rooted in Islamic law and local customs, which may differ significantly from Western legal systems. Beginner English speakers may find it challenging to understand these cultural nuances and adapt to them.
3. Limited access to legal resources: In some MENA countries, there may be limited access to legal resources such as books, journals, and online databases. This can make it difficult for beginner English speakers to research and prepare their cases, especially compared to native Arabic speakers who have more access to these resources.
4. Lack of legal terminology: Legal terminology may be unfamiliar to beginner English speakers, making it challenging to understand court proceedings, legal documents, and legal advice.
5. Limited legal education: In some MENA countries, there may be limited access to legal education and training programs, which can hinder the ability of beginner English speakers to learn about the legal system and navigate its complexities.
6. Gender disparities: In some MENA countries, there are gender disparities in the legal system, which can make it challenging for women to access justice and protect their rights. Beginner English speakers may face additional barriers due to cultural attitudes towards women's rights.
7. Limited access to legal aid: In many MENA countries, there is limited access to free or low-cost legal aid services, which can make it difficult for beginner English speakers to obtain legal representation and advice.
8. Corruption and nepotism: Corruption and nepotism are still prevalent in some MENA
