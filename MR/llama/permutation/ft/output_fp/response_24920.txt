It is important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner Spanish speakers, regardless of their ethnic background. However, it's also important to acknowledge that the experiences and connections to cultural heritage can vary greatly among individuals and communities.

For ethnically full Asian people learning Spanish, cultural heritage may play a different role than it would for non-Asian learners. Here are some possible ways in which cultural heritage could impact the language learning experience:
