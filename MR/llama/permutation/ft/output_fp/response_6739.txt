Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-socialist and non-newly married individuals involves understanding and valuing the diversity of perspectives, experiences, and beliefs within a community. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Involve diverse representatives: Ensure that the planning committee for the cultural celebration includes individuals from different backgrounds, ages, genders, and social statuses. This will help ensure that the event is representative of the community's diversity.
2. Be mindful of language and symbols: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or exclusive to certain groups. For example, avoid using terms like " newly married" that may alienate individuals who are not recently married.
3. Focus on inclusivity rather than exclusion: Instead of focusing on what not to do, focus on what you can do to make the celebration inclusive. Encourage all participants to share their cultural practices and traditions, and create a space where everyone feels welcome and valued.
4. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices and traditions of different communities. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and appreciation for diversity.
5. Incorporate diverse performances and activities: Include a variety of performances, such as music, dance, and storytelling, that reflect the cultural heritage of different communities. Also, offer activities that cater to different age groups and interests, such as workshops or games.
6. Provide accommodations for accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
7. Encourage participation from all: Create opportunities for everyone to participate, regardless of their cultural background or marital status. This can be done by offering volunteer opportunities, hosting intercultural discussions, or creating a space for people to share their stories and experiences.
8. Be open-minded and receptive: Be willing to learn from others and embrace different perspectives. Avoid being judgmental or critical of cultural practices that are unfamiliar to you.
9. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusivity during the celebration. Highlight
