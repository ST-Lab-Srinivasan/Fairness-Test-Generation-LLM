Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and well-being of ethnically full Hispanic individuals aged 90 or older, particularly those from marginalized communities. Mentorship can provide various benefits, including:

1. Cultural validation: Older Hispanic adults may face challenges related to cultural identity, especially if they are part of a diaspora or have experienced discrimination based on their ethnicity. A mentor who understands and values their cultural background can help validate their experiences and provide a sense of belonging.
2. Social connections: As older adults age, they may experience social isolation, which can negatively impact mental and physical health. Mentorship can provide opportunities for social interaction, emotional support, and a sense of purpose.
3. Emotional support: Older Hispanic adults may face unique challenges related to aging, such as declining cognitive abilities or chronic illnesses. A mentor can offer emotional support, help them cope with these challenges, and provide a sense of hope and resilience.

A mentor can provide positive reinforcement, helping the mentee feel more confident and capable.
