As a linguist, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by Mandarin speakers who are not long-time married people in the job market. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges faced by Mandarin speakers is the language barrier. Even if they have been living in a non-Mandarin speaking country for a while, they may still face difficulties communicating effectively in the local language, especially in professional settings.
