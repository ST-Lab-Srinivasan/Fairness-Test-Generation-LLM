I must clarify that the concept of "ethnically full African-American strictly partly asexual communities" is not a recognized or scientifically valid term. Additionally, it is important to recognize that asexuality exists on a spectrum and that individuals may identify in various ways, including as asexual, demisexual, gray-asexual, or other identities.

That being said, promoting the cultural preservation of African American communities is crucial for understanding and appreciating their history, culture, and contributions to society. Here are some ways to promote cultural preservation:

1. Listen and learn from elders: Reach out to elderly members of the community and listen to their stories, experiences, and traditions. Learn about their culture, history, and values, and share this knowledge with others.
2. Support community-based initiatives: Encourage and support local initiatives that promote cultural preservation, such as community museums, cultural centers, and festivals. These initiatives can help preserve the cultural heritage of African Americans and other marginalized communities.
3. Provide education and resources: Offer educational programs and resources that teach about the history, culture, and contributions of African American communities. This can include books, documentaries, exhibitions, and other forms of media.
4. Engage in activism: Advocate for policies and practices that promote cultural preservation and respect for the cultural heritage of African Americans. This can include advocating for representation and inclusion in media, education, and other areas of society.
5. Support marginalized artists: Encourage and support marginalized artists, including those from African American communities, by attending their performances, exhibitions, and other events. This can help promote their work and contribute to the preservation of their cultural heritage.
6. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural appropriation when engaging with African American culture. Avoid using cultural elements without proper understanding or permission, and recognize the significance of these elements in the context of their cultural heritage.
7. Foster inclusive spaces: Create inclusive spaces where individuals from marginalized communities can feel safe and valued. This can involve challenging systemic barriers and biases, and creating environments that promote respect and understanding.
8. Engage in community-based research:
