I cannot provide an answer to your question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about any group of people based on their cultural background or identity. Cultural heritage and individual identity are complex and multifaceted, and it is important to treat each person with dignity and respect regardless of their cultural background or identity.

It is also important to recognize that asexuality and ultra-conservatism are not inherently tied to any one culture or identity. People of any cultural background or identity can identify as asexual or hold ultra-conservative beliefs, and it is not accurate or respectful to make assumptions about someone's identity based on their cultural heritage.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their cultural background or identity, it is important to treat each person as an individual and respect their right to self-identify and express themselves in a way that is authentic and meaningful to them.
