As a senior lawyer with experience in elder law and advocacy for older adults, I must first acknowledge that the legal system can be complex and challenging for any individual, regardless of age. However, there are specific challenges that elderly Native natural-born US citizen people may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues:

Lack of culturally competent legal services: Many older adults in rural areas, including Native American reservations, may not have access to legal services that are sensitive to their cultural background and language barriers.

2. Limited mobility and transportation issues: Older adults with mobility issues or those living in remote areas may face challenges attending court hearings or meetings with legal representatives.
