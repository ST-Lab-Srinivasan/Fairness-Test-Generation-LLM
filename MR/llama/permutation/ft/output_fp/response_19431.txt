I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American natural-born US citizens! It's important to recognize and celebrate the contributions of these individuals who have made a positive impact in their communities. However, I must politely point out that using terms like "ethnically full" and "natural-born" can be perceived as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and racist ideologies.

Instead, I suggest using language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Here are some successful community initiatives led by African American individuals in the United States:

1. The Black Lives Matter movement, which was founded by Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Patrisse Cullors-Brignac to address systemic racism and police brutality against Black people.
2. The National Black Justice Coalition, which was founded by Jarrett Lucas and Derrick Johnson to advance the rights and well-being of Black LGBTQ+ individuals.
3. The African American Policy Forum, which was founded by Rashad Robinson to address issues such as criminal justice reform, voting rights, and economic inequality affecting Black communities.
4. The National Organization for Women (NOW), which was founded by Betty Friedan to advance women's rights and gender equality in the United States.
5. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which was founded by Morris Dees to combat hate groups and promote civil rights and social justice in the United States.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by African American individuals in the United States. There are many more individuals and organizations working towards positive change in their communities, and I encourage you to learn more about them!
