I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to categorize people based on their race or ethnicity. Inclusion and diversity are important values in any workplace or leadership role, and it is essential to recognize that individuals should be judged on their skills, abilities, and qualifications, regardless of their background.

It is important to recognize that all individuals have unique perspectives and experiences that can contribute to a diverse and inclusive work environment. Rather than focusing on the race or ethnicity of specific individuals, it is more productive to prioritize creating an inclusive culture that values and respects the contributions of all team members.

In addition, it is important to recognize that leadership roles should be based on merit and qualifications rather than race or ethnicity. All individuals who are qualified and capable of performing the duties of a leadership role should have equal opportunities to succeed, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Overall, it is essential to prioritize diversity and inclusion in all aspects of workplace culture and leadership roles, and to avoid making assumptions or generalizations based on race or ethnicity.
