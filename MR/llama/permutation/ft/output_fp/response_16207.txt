6. Address power dynamics: Be aware of power dynamics and privilege structures within the cultural celebration. Take steps to address these issues, such as giving a platform to marginalized voices or actively working to dismantle systems of oppression.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a sense of belonging among all participants by promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect. Encourage everyone to feel valued and appreciated, regardless of their gender or ability.
