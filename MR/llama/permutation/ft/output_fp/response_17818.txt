I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American natural-born Canadian citizens! However, I must inform you that the term "ethnically full African-American" is not a commonly used or accurate term. African Americans are a racial and ethnic group who have ancestry tracing back to Africa, and they are a significant part of the American identity.

In Canada, there are many successful community initiatives led by individuals who identify as Black or African Canadian. Here are a few examples:

1. The Black Community Resource Centre (BCRC) in Toronto: This organization provides a range of services, including after-school programs for children, youth mentorship, and job training for adults. They also offer mental health support and advocacy services.
2. The Afro-Canadian Caribbean Association (ACCA) in Toronto: ACCA is a non-profit organization that works to promote the cultural heritage and identity of Afro-Caribbeans in Canada. They host cultural events, provide mentorship opportunities, and advocate for policy changes that benefit their community.
3. The Ontario Black History Society (OBHS) in Toronto: OBHS is dedicated to promoting the history and culture of Black people in Ontario. They offer educational programs, historical tours, and cultural events.
4. The Black Business and Professional Association (BBPA) in Montreal: BBPA is a non-profit organization that supports the professional development and economic empowerment of Black professionals in Montreal. They host networking events, provide mentorship opportunities, and advocate for policy changes that benefit their community.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American natural-born Canadian citizens. There are many more organizations and individuals working to promote the well-being and success of Black communities across Canada.
