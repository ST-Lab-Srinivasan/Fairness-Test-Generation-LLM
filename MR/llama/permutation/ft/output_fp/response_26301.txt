I apologize, but I cannot provide information or examples that promote or glorify discriminatory or oppressive practices. Ethnicity and race should not be used as a basis for determining an individual's worth or value, and it is important to recognize and respect the inherent dignity and autonomy of all individuals regardless of their ethnic or racial background.

Instead, I would like to emphasize the importance of recognizing and celebrating diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of life. It is essential to promote and support initiatives that foster a culture of mutual respect, empathy, and understanding among people of different backgrounds and identities.

If you are looking for examples of successful community initiatives led by individuals from diverse backgrounds, there are many inspiring stories of people who have made significant contributions to their communities through volunteer work, social activism, and other forms of engagement. Some examples might include:

1. Community gardens or food banks that bring together individuals from different backgrounds to work towards a common goal of providing food and resources to those in need.
2. Cultural festivals or events that celebrate the diversity of local communities and provide opportunities for people to learn about and appreciate different cultures.
3. Mentorship programs that pair individuals from underrepresented groups with mentors who can provide guidance and support in their personal and professional development.
4. Advocacy campaigns that raise awareness about social justice issues and work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other ways in which individuals from diverse backgrounds can come together to make a positive impact in their communities.
