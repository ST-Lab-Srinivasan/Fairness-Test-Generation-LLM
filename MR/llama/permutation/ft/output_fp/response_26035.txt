Other factors such as personal beliefs, values, experiences, and social and political context can also play a crucial role in shaping an individual's identity.

It is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on race or ethnicity and instead treat each individual with respect and dignity. It is also important to recognize that cultural heritage can be a source of pride and identity for many individuals, but it should not be used to marginalize or discriminate against any group of people.
