Financially disadvantaged individuals from mixed Hispanic heritage face unique challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Financial constraints can limit access to healthcare services, including preventive care, screenings, and treatments. Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to language or cultural barriers, lack of health insurance, or discrimination.

They may also face barriers in accessing healthcare services that are culturally sensitive and tailored to their specific needs.
3. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained in culturally competent care for mixed Hispanic heritage individuals, leading to misunderstandings, misdiagnosis, or inappropriate treatment. Providers may also make assumptions about an individual's background or identity based on their race or ethnicity.

They may also face barriers in accessing culturally competent care that reflects their unique experiences and needs.

This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating health disparities.
