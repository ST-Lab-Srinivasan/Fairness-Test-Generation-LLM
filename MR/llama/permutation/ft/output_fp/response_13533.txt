Title: Challenges Faced by Lower-Class Mixed Hispanic Heritages in the Healthcare System

Introduction:
Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals face a multitude of challenges in the healthcare system, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. These individuals often encounter barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to various factors, including cultural and language differences, lack of health insurance, and discrimination. This article will explore these challenges in-depth, highlighting the specific difficulties faced by this vulnerable population.

Cultural and Language Barriers:
Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may face challenges in navigating the healthcare system due to cultural and language barriers. Many of these individuals are bilingual or multilingual, but they may not speak the dominant language of their area, which can create communication difficulties with healthcare providers. Additionally, cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical needs and treatment options.

Lack of Health Insurance:
Lower-class mixed Hispanic heritage individuals are more likely to experience barriers in accessing healthcare due to a lack of health insurance. Many of these individuals work in low-paying jobs without access to employer-based insurance or have limited financial resources to purchase individual coverage. As a result, they may delay medical care or forego necessary treatments, exacerbating their health issues and increasing the likelihood of adverse health outcomes.

Discrimination:
Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may also experience discrimination in the healthcare system, which can lead to feelings of mistrust and discomfort when seeking medical care. Studies have shown that minority patients are more likely to be subjected to unnecessary testing or procedures, leading to a higher likelihood of adverse events. Additionally, language barriers can contribute to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical needs and treatment options.

Social Determinants of Health:
Lower-class mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may face additional challenges related to social determinants of health, such as poverty, housing instability, and food insecurity. These factors can impact their overall health and well-being, increasing the likelihood of chronic diseases and decreasing access to preventive care.
