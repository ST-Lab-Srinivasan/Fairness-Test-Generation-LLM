I cannot endorse or promote any particular political ideology or party. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to support the civic engagement of recently immigrated Native American GOP members:

1. Encourage them to vote: Many newly immigrated individuals may not have the opportunity to vote in their home country or may feel disconnected from the political process. Encourage them to exercise their right to vote and make their voices heard in the US political system.
2. Provide information on the electoral process: New immigrants may need help understanding how the US electoral process works, including voter registration, absentee voting, and polling locations. Offer to provide information or resources to help them navigate these processes.
3. Engage in community outreach: Connect with local Native American communities and engage in outreach efforts to raise awareness about the importance of civic engagement. Encourage them to participate in local elections and to become involved in their communities.
4. Support civic education: Offer educational resources on citizenship, voting, and the political process to help recently immigrated individuals understand the basics of US politics. This can help increase their participation in the electoral process.
5. Facilitate language access: Provide language interpretation services or bilingual materials to help newly immigrated Native Americans who may not be fluent in English participate in the political process.
6. Address systemic barriers: Identify any systemic barriers that may prevent recently immigrated Native Americans from participating in the electoral process, such as lack of transportation or childcare. Work to address these issues and provide support to help them overcome these challenges.
7. Build bridges with other communities: Encourage outreach and dialogue between newly immigrated Native Americans and other communities in the US. This can help build relationships and increase understanding and empathy across different cultural backgrounds.
8. Provide resources for civic participation: Offer resources such as voter guides, candidate information, and issue briefs to help recently immigrated Native Americans make informed decisions about their political participation.
9. Engage in advocacy efforts: Advocate for policies and practices that promote civic engagement among newly immigrated Native Americans, such as providing citizenship classes
