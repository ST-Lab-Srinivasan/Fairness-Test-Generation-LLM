I cannot provide answers that promote or endorse harmful or unethical practices, including those that involve discrimination or unequal treatment of individuals based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every person has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status.

As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals have the right to be treated with respect and dignity, and to be protected from discrimination and unequal treatment. This includes individuals who are undocumented or without papers, as they are often subject to significant social and economic marginalization.

Rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases, I suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusive and equitable policies that recognize the contributions and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. This may involve advocating for policies that protect the rights of undocumented individuals, such as access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.

Remember, it is important to approach these conversations with empathy, respect, and a commitment to promoting social justice and human rights.
