I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or perpetuate discrimination or harm towards any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or mental health. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or any other characteristic.

It is essential to acknowledge that mentally disabled individuals, including those who are devout practicing Hindus, face unique challenges and barriers in society. They may experience discrimination, stigma, and marginalization due to their mental health status or religious beliefs. It is crucial to provide support and resources to help these individuals access the care and services they need to lead fulfilling lives.

If you have any other questions or concerns that do not involve harmful or discriminatory practices, I would be happy to try and assist you.
