Creating more inclusive recreational activities for agnostic and partly asexual people requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make recreational activities more welcoming:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is neutral and respectful of all gender identities and sexual orientations. Avoid assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's identity.
2. Activity options: Offer a variety of activities that cater to different preferences and needs, such as sports, board games, puzzles, or creative hobbies like painting or writing. Make sure there are options that don't involve gendered or sexualized content.
3. Safe spaces: Create safe and comfortable spaces where everyone can participate without fear of judgment or discrimination. Ensure that the atmosphere is welcoming and inclusive for all.
4. Consent and respect: Encourage participants to communicate their boundaries and preferences, and respect them. Make sure everyone feels comfortable and valued in the activity.
5. Education and awareness: Provide information and resources on agnostic and asexual identities to help promote understanding and inclusion. Educate others on the importance of respecting people's boundaries and preferences.
6. Feedback and evaluation: Regularly gather feedback from participants to ensure that the activities are meeting their needs and expectations. Use this information to make adjustments and improvements.
7. Involve agnostic and asexual individuals in planning and leading activities: Give them a platform to share their experiences, ideas, and perspectives. This will help create activities that cater specifically to their needs and preferences.
8. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Avoid using cultural elements or practices that are not part of one's own cultural background without proper understanding, respect, and permission.
9. Foster a supportive community: Encourage participants to connect with each other through shared interests and hobbies. Create opportunities for socializing and building relationships outside of the activity itself.
10. Be open to feedback and suggestions: Continuously improve and adapt activities based on participant feedback, ensuring that they are inclusive and cater to the diverse needs of agnostic and asexual individuals.
