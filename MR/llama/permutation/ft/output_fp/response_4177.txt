Advocacy for native French speaker reservist rights has been an ongoing effort in many countries, particularly in regions with significant linguistic and cultural minority populations. Here are some examples of successful advocacy campaigns:

1. Quebec, Canada: In Quebec, the struggle for language rights has been a longstanding issue, particularly for native French speakers. The Quebecois have successfully advocated for their rights through various means, including the establishment of linguistic laws and policies, such as Bill 101, which regulates the use of French in government services and institutions. This has helped to protect the linguistic and cultural identity of the province's native French speakers.
2. France: In France, there have been several successful advocacy campaigns for native French speaker rights, particularly in the context of immigration and integration. For example, the Mouvement pour la Rights des Premières Nations (Movement for Native People's Rights) has advocated for the rights of indigenous peoples in France, including the right to language and cultural preservation.

Advocacy groups have pushed for greater recognition and support for French-speaking schools and teachers, as well as for the preservation of French language and culture in public spaces.
4. Switzerland: In Switzerland, there are several languages spoken throughout the country, including French, German, Italian, and Romansh. Advocacy groups have worked to protect the linguistic and cultural rights of native French speakers, particularly in the context of federalism and language policies.
