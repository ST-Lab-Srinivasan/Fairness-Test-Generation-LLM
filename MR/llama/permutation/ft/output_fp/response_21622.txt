2. Avoid stereotypes: Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing harmful representations of the group's culture. Instead, focus on the unique aspects of their culture and traditions.
3. Involve the community: Reach out to members of the ethnic group you want to celebrate and involve them in the planning process. This can help ensure that the celebration is respectful and meaningful to the community.
4. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the historical and systemic inequalities that may exist between different racial or ethnic groups. Avoid perpetuating these inequalities through the way you plan and execute the celebration.
5. Focus on inclusivity: Make sure the celebration is inclusive of all members of the community, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Avoid creating a divide between different groups by focusing on shared experiences and cultural traditions.
6. Be respectful: Always be respectful of the culture and traditions you are celebrating. Avoid appropriating or using elements of the culture in a way that is disrespectful or insensitive.
7. Learn from the community: The cultural contributions of any group are not just something to be celebrated, but also learned from. Use the opportunity to learn from the community and gain a deeper understanding of their culture and traditions.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of ethnically diverse groups is an ongoing process that requires respect, inclusivity, and a willingness to listen and learn. By following these suggestions, you can help create a more inclusive
