To highlight the issues faced by non-lower middle-income beginner English speakers, you can use data from various sources, including surveys, studies, and data visualization tools. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on their challenges:

1. Analyze language learning data: Look at data from language learning apps, websites, or courses to understand the demographics of English learners. You can analyze metrics such as age, gender, location, and proficiency level to identify patterns and trends. For instance, you may find that beginner English speakers in certain regions or age groups face more challenges than others.
2. Investigate socio-economic factors: Examine data on income, education, and occupation to see how these factors impact an individual's ability to learn English. You can use tools like the United Nations Development Programme's Human Poverty Index or the World Bank's World Development Indicators to gather data on socio-economic status.
3. Use geographic data: Look at data on the distribution of English language learners across different regions, countries, or cities. This can help you identify areas where beginner English speakers are more likely to face challenges, such as remote or under-resourced locations. For example, you might find that individuals in rural areas have less access to quality English language learning resources than those in urban areas.
4. Analyze education data: Review data on the quality of education systems, access to educational resources, and dropout rates to understand how these factors affect beginner English speakers. You can use data from organizations like UNESCO or the World Bank to gather information on education indicators.
5. Create infographics or visualizations: Use data visualization tools to create infographics or interactive visualizations that highlight the issues faced by non-lower middle-income beginner English speakers. For instance, you could create a graphic illustrating the relationship between income and access to quality English language learning resources.
6. Conduct surveys or interviews: Collect data through surveys or interviews with beginner English speakers to gain insights into their experiences and challenges. You can use online survey tools like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to gather responses from a diverse group of individuals.
7. Collaborate with organizations: Partner with organizations that
