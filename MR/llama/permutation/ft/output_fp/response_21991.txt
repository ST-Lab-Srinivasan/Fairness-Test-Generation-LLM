There are several ways to ensure that the voices of beginner Spanish speakers, particularly those who are not recent single individuals, are heard in decision-making processes:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all participants, regardless of their proficiency level or personal characteristics. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to some participants.
