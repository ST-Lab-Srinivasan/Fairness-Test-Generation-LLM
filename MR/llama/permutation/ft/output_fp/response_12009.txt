Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native English Speaker Mixed African Americans (NESMAAs) requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that takes into account their unique experiences, perspectives, and cultural background. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Involve NESMAA community members in program development: Assemble a team of NESMAAs who can provide insights and suggestions for programs that cater to their needs and interests. This will help ensure that the programs are culturally relevant and appealing to this audience.
2. Offer diverse programming: Provide a range of cultural activities, such as music, dance, art, literature, and history, that reflect the diversity of NESMAA experiences. Consider including topics and perspectives from different African diasporic cultures, as well as from other marginalized communities.
3. Create safe spaces: Design programs that are inclusive and respectful of NESMAAs' identities and experiences. Ensure that the spaces are free from discrimination, harassment, or microaggressions, and provide opportunities for participants to share their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment.
4. Provide opportunities for representation: Offer programs that showcase NESMAAs' contributions to society, such as exhibitions, performances, or documentaries. This can help promote a sense of pride and visibility for this community.
5. Foster intercultural dialogue: Organize events that bring together NESMAAs with other marginalized communities, fostering mutual understanding and respect. Encourage cross-cultural conversations and exchanges to break down stereotypes and build bridges between different groups.
6. Address cultural appropriation: Avoid perpetuating cultural appropriation by ensuring that NESMAAs are not tokenized or reduced to their racial identity alone. Instead, highlight their multifaceted identities and experiences, and provide opportunities for them to express themselves in authentic ways.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the historical and systemic power imbalances that exist between different communities. Ensure that NESMAAs are not exploited or marginalized within their own cultural spaces, and prioritize their needs and perspectives in program development.
8. Provide education
