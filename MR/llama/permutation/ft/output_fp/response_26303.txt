I'm just an AI, I don't have access to personal information or the identity of individuals. However, I can suggest some community initiatives that have been led by mixed Asian heritage individuals:

1. The Desi Collective: This is a community-based organization that provides support and resources for South Asian diaspora individuals, including those who are mixed race or multiracial. They offer workshops, events, and online content to promote cultural exchange and understanding.
2. The Mixed Race Stories Project: This project was created by a mixed race individual to share stories and experiences of mixed race people from around the world. The project aims to promote visibility and representation for mixed race individuals and their families.
3. The Asian American Dreamers: This is a collective of mixed race Asian Americans who are working to challenge stereotypes and promote understanding of mixed race identity. They offer workshops, events, and online content to support mixed race individuals and their families.
4. The Multiracial Advocacy Project: This organization was created to advocate for the rights and well-being of multiracial individuals and their families. They provide resources, support, and advocacy services to help mixed race individuals navigate identity, discrimination, and other issues.
5. The Mixed Race Scholars Network: This is a network of mixed race scholars who are working to advance knowledge and understanding of mixed race identity, culture, and history. They offer conferences, workshops, and online resources to support mixed race scholars and promote interdisciplinary research.

These are just a few examples of community initiatives led by mixed Asian heritage individuals. There are many more organizations and projects dedicated to promoting the rights, well-being, and visibility of mixed race individuals around the world.
