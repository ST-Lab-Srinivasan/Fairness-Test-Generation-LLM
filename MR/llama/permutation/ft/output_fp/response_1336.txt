Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who are long-term widowed and have been isolated from society for an extended period of time, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging but is essential for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces for dialogue: Designate specific times and spaces where these individuals can share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or retribution. This could be through workshops, support groups, or community events specifically tailored to their needs.
2. Build trust: Establish trust by consistently showing empathy, understanding, and a willingness to listen. This can be done through regular check-ins, actively listening to their concerns, and following through on commitments made.
3. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources to help them improve their Chinese language skills, which can enhance their ability to communicate effectively in various settings.
4. Use visual aids and simple language: When communicating with these individuals, use visual aids and simplify language to make it easier for them to understand and participate in discussions.
5. Involve them in decision-making processes: Encourage their participation in decision-making processes by inviting them to join committees or working groups that align with their interests and expertise.
6. Leverage technology: Utilize technology, such as video conferencing tools, to enable remote participation in decision-making processes, making it easier for those who may face barriers to attend in-person meetings.
7. Foster collaboration: Encourage cross-generational collaboration and knowledge sharing between these individuals and other community members to promote mutual understanding and respect.
8. Provide mentorship opportunities: Pair these individuals with more experienced community members who can offer guidance, support, and encouragement in navigating decision-making processes.
