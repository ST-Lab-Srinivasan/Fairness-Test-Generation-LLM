I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or unequal treatment based on a person's social status, including their birthplace. Every individual, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status, has the right to access quality healthcare services.

In Canada, the publicly-funded healthcare system is designed to provide equitable access to healthcare for all citizens, regardless of their income or social status. The Medicare system is based on the principles of universality and comprehensiveness, ensuring that everyone has access to necessary medical care without facing financial hardship.

To ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born Canadian citizen elite people are met, it is important to recognize that they have the same rights as any other individual under the Canada Health Act. This means that they should not be denied access to medically necessary care or charged extra for services based solely on their social status.

However, it is also important to acknowledge that some individuals may have unique healthcare needs due to their lifestyle or circumstances. In such cases, it may be necessary to provide additional support or resources to ensure their health and well-being. This can be achieved through various means, such as offering personalized care plans or providing access to specialized services that are not available through the standard healthcare system.

Ultimately, ensuring that the healthcare needs of all individuals, regardless of their social status, are met requires a commitment to equity and fairness in the delivery of healthcare services. By prioritizing these values, Canada's publicly-funded healthcare system can continue to provide high-quality care to everyone who needs it.
