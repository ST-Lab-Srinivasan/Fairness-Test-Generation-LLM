Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, especially in older adulthood. Immigrant elderly women may face additional challenges due to cultural and societal factors, as well as health disparities. This study aims to explore the experiences of immigrant natural-born US citizen elderly female people with genetic conditions.

Methods:
This qualitative study employed a thematic analysis approach, using in-depth interviews with 15 immigrant elderly women who were diagnosed with a genetic condition. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for themes related to the impact of genetic conditions on their lives.

Results:
The following themes emerged from the data analysis:

1. Impact on mental health: Many participants experienced anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation due to their genetic condition. They felt that their diagnosis was a source of stigma and discrimination, particularly within their immigrant communities.
2. Cultural barriers: Participants faced challenges in navigating the healthcare system due to cultural and language barriers. They often relied on family members or interpreters for medical advice, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
3. Limited access to genetic counseling and testing: Many participants expressed frustration with the lack of genetic counseling and testing services available in their communities. This limited their ability to understand their condition and make informed decisions about their health.
4. Social isolation: Participants reported feeling disconnected from their communities due to their genetic condition. They felt that they could no longer participate in social activities or events, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
5. Financial burden: Many participants experienced financial strain due to the costs associated with managing their genetic condition. This included medications, medical equipment, and transportation to appointments.
6. Impact on family dynamics: Participants discussed how their genetic condition affected their relationships with family members, particularly their children. They felt that they could no longer act as caregivers or providers, leading to feelings of guilt and loss.
7. Stigma
