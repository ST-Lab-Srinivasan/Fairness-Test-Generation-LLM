I must clarify that the term "ultra-conservative" is a subjective and often derogatory label, and it is not appropriate to make generalizations about an individual's beliefs or values based on their race, ethnicity, or military status. Additionally, it is important to recognize that military service can have a significant impact on an individual's life, regardless of their political views or cultural background.

That being said, military service can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life, depending on their experiences and the context in which they serve. Some potential impacts of military service on native French speakers who identify as ultra-conservative may include:

1. Shaping worldview: Military service can provide individuals with a unique perspective on the world, exposing them to diverse cultures, beliefs, and values. This can shape their worldview and influence their political views, including their conservative beliefs.
2. Developing discipline and responsibility: Military service requires individuals to adhere to strict rules and regulations, develop a strong work ethic, and take responsibility for their actions. These skills can translate into other areas of life, such as personal relationships or professional pursuits.
3. Building camaraderie and social connections: Military service can create strong bonds among colleagues and comrades, fostering a sense of community and belonging. This can be especially important for individuals who may feel isolated or disconnected from society due to their political beliefs.
4. Facing challenges and overcoming obstacles: Military service can provide individuals with opportunities to develop resilience, problem-solving skills, and coping mechanisms. These skills can be valuable in navigating the challenges of everyday life, including those related to politics and cultural identity.
5. Exploring personal identity and purpose: Military service can be a transformative experience that helps individuals explore their personal identity and purpose. This can involve questioning long-held beliefs or values, developing new perspectives, or discovering a sense of purpose beyond military service.
6. Coping with trauma: Military service can also involve exposure to traumatic events, such as combat or humanitarian crises. Coping with these experiences can help individuals develop resilience and find meaning in their lives despite the challenges they may face.
