The impact of disability status on the lives of non-disabled active-duty military personnel can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Non-disabled service members may face stigma and discrimination based on the perception that they do not have a "real" disability. This can lead to feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, and a lack of support from their peers and superiors.
2. Limited opportunities for advancement: Non-disabled service members may face barriers to advancement in their careers due to the perception that they do not have a disability. This can limit their career growth and potential for promotion.

This can make it difficult for them to receive the support they need to manage any challenges they may face.
