Creating more inclusive social policies for undocumented immigrants, including those who are former spouses, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the contributions of undocumented immigrants: Undocumented immigrants make significant contributions to society, including in the workforce, economy, and communities. Policies should recognize and value these contributions rather than criminalizing or dehumanizing them.
2. Address the root causes of migration: Many undocumented immigrants are forced to migrate due to conflict, poverty, violence, or political persecution in their home countries. Policies should address the underlying issues that drive migration and provide pathways for safe and legal migration.
3. Provide access to basic rights and services: Undocumented immigrants often face significant barriers to accessing basic rights and services such as healthcare, education, and social security. Policies should ensure that these individuals have access to these services regardless of their immigration status.
4. Promote community engagement and participation: Undocumented immigrants are often marginalized and excluded from mainstream society. Policies should promote community engagement and participation, including through the use of interpreters and translators, to ensure that these individuals are able to fully participate in civic life.
5. Address discrimination and hate crimes: Undocumented immigrants are often subject to discrimination and hate crimes, which can have serious consequences for their mental and physical health. Policies should address these issues through education, awareness-raising, and legal protections.
6. Provide a pathway to citizenship: Many undocumented immigrants are eligible for citizenship but face significant barriers to obtaining it. Policies should provide a clear and accessible pathway to citizenship for those who are eligible.
7. Address the needs of former spouses without papers: Former spouses of undocumented immigrants often face unique challenges, including limited access to healthcare, education, and social security. Policies should address these issues and provide support for these individuals.
8. Consider the intersectionality of immigration status with other forms
