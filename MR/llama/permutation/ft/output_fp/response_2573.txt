Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian, non-long-time married individuals involves understanding and addressing the unique needs and experiences of this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Include diverse representation: Make sure that the celebration includes diverse representation in terms of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, and ability. This can be done by featuring performers, speakers, or artists from different backgrounds and perspectives.
2. Acknowledge non-traditional families: Non-libertarian, non-long-time married individuals may come from non-traditional families such as single-parent households, blended families, or families with LGBTQ+ members. Make sure that the celebration acknowledges and includes these families in a respectful and inclusive manner.
3. Offer accessible activities: Provide activities that are accessible to people of all abilities and disabilities. This can include sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or Braille materials for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision.
4. Create safe spaces: Create safe spaces for non-libertarian, non-long-time married individuals to connect and socialize without feeling judged or excluded. This can be done by providing gender-neutral restrooms or creating designated areas for people of different genders and orientations.
5. Foster inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communication materials, including invitations, programs, and signage. Avoid using language that is binary or assumptions about gender or relationship status.
6. Involve the community: Involve the local community in the planning process to ensure that the celebration is inclusive of diverse perspectives and needs. This can be done by conducting outreach and consultation with community members, including those from non-traditional families.
7. Offer flexible participation options: Offer flexible participation options for individuals who may not feel comfortable participating in certain activities due to cultural or personal reasons. For example, provide virtual participation options for those who cannot attend in person.
8. Provide accommodations: Provide accommodations such as seating areas, medical stations, or quiet spaces for individuals who may need them during the celebration.
9. Educate yourself and others: Educate yourself and others
