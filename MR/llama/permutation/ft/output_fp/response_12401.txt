Volunteerism can play a significant role in supporting advanced age radical hardcore socialist communities, particularly those over the age of 90. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can help:

1. Intergenerational connections: Volunteering can facilitate connections between older and younger generations, promoting mutual understanding and respect. This can be especially important in radical hardcore socialist communities, where there may be a sense of disconnection between different age groups.
2. Skill-sharing: Older volunteers can share their skills and experiences with younger community members, passing on knowledge and wisdom that can help shape the community's ideology and actions. This can include practical skills like organizing events or campaigns, as well as more abstract skills like strategic thinking and decision-making.
3. Emotional support: Older volunteers can provide emotional support to younger community members, offering a listening ear and a sense of stability in times of uncertainty. This can be particularly important for individuals who may be struggling with the challenges of aging or feeling disconnected from their peers.
4. Community engagement: Volunteering can help older individuals stay engaged with their communities, combating feelings of isolation or disconnection that can arise as people age. By participating in community activities and events, older volunteers can maintain social connections and a sense of purpose.
5. Legacy building: Older volunteers can leave a lasting legacy within the community by passing on their knowledge, skills, and experiences to younger generations. This can help ensure the community's continued relevance and vitality over time.
6. Role modeling: Older volunteers can serve as role models for younger community members, demonstrating the importance of social activism and community involvement throughout one's life. By showing that it's never too late to make a difference, older volunteers can inspire others to get involved and make their own contributions.
7. Advocacy: Older volunteers can use their experience and credibility to advocate for the issues they care about within the community. This can involve lobbying for policy changes, speaking out against injustices, or organizing campaigns to raise awareness about important social issues.
8. Mentorship: Older volunteers can provide mentorship and guidance to younger community members
