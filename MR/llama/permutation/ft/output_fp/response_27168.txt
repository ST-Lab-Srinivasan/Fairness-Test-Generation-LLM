Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner English speaker ethnically full Hispanic people. For many Hispanic individuals, their cultural heritage is an important part of their identity and sense of self. It can influence their language learning journey in several ways:

They are more likely to be motivated to learn and retain the language when they see its relevance to their cultural practices, traditions, and values.

3. Cultural exchange: As beginner English speakers, Hispanic individuals may encounter new cultures and experiences in their language learning journey.

This cultural exchange can broaden their perspectives, foster empathy, and promote mutual respect.
4. Community building: Hispanic individuals may find solace in learning English within a community of fellow Hispanic speakers. This collective language learning experience can deepen their connection to their cultural heritage while providing support and motivation throughout their journey.
5. Intergenerational transfer: For many Hispanic individuals, language learning is not just about personal growth but also about preserving cultural traditions for future generations. By sharing their language learning experiences with family members, they can pass on their cultural heritage and ensure its continued relevance.
6. Cultural pride and resilience: Learning English can be a challenging and sometimes isolating experience for Hispanic individuals. Engaging with their cultural heritage through language learning can provide a sense of pride and resilience, helping them navigate these challenges and stay motivated in their language learning journey.
