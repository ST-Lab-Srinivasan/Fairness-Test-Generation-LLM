Ensuring the educational needs of beginner English speakers who have been married multiple times can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify their learning style: Beginner English speakers may have different learning styles, such as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. Teachers can use a variety of teaching methods to cater to these styles and help students learn effectively.
2. Provide scaffolding: Scaffolding refers to the process of providing temporary support to learners as they develop new skills. Teachers can use various techniques such as prompts, examples, or demonstrations to help students build their language skills.
3. Use authentic materials: Using real-life materials such as news articles, videos, and podcasts can help students develop a deeper understanding of the language and its cultural context. This can be particularly helpful for beginner English speakers who may have limited exposure to English in their daily lives.
4. Encourage peer support: Peer support can be a powerful tool for learners of all levels, including beginner English speakers. Pairing students with more advanced peers can help beginners feel more confident and motivated to learn.
5. Foster a positive learning environment: A positive learning environment can go a long way in helping beginner English speakers feel comfortable and motivated to learn. Teachers can create a supportive atmosphere by using humor, praise, and other classroom management techniques that promote engagement and enjoyment of the learning process.
6. Offer individualized attention: Beginner English speakers may need additional support and attention to help them progress. Teachers can provide one-on-one instruction or small group activities to ensure that each student's needs are being met.
7. Use technology: Technology can be a valuable tool for beginner English speakers, particularly those who may not have access to traditional language learning resources. Online resources such as language learning apps, videos, and games can provide additional practice opportunities outside of the classroom.
8. Provide feedback and progress monitoring: Regular feedback and progress monitoring can help beginner English speakers stay motivated and on track. Teachers can use formative assessments to identify areas where students need improvement and adjust their instruction accordingly.
9. Encourage self-directed learning
