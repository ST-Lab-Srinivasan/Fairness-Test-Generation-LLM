Ensuring that the voices of partly asexual casual Buddhist individuals are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, as they may face discrimination or marginalization due to their identity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces for self-identified asexual and casual Buddhists: Provide opportunities for these individuals to gather, share their experiences, and build community. This can help create a sense of belonging and support, which can translate into greater visibility and influence in decision-making processes.
2. Educate decision-makers about asexuality and the needs of asexual Buddhists: Provide training or workshops for decision-makers on asexuality and the unique challenges faced by asexual individuals. This can help raise awareness and empathy, leading to more inclusive decision-making.
3. Encourage representation and participation: Ensure that partly asexual casual Buddhists are represented in decision-making bodies and have opportunities to participate in discussions and decisions. This can be achieved by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences, and creating spaces for open dialogue and collaboration.
4. Develop policies and practices that support asexual individuals: Create policies and procedures that acknowledge and address the specific needs of asexual Buddhists, such as providing alternative options for spiritual practices or rituals that do not involve sexuality.
5. Engage in advocacy and activism: Work with organizations and communities to advocate for the rights and dignity of asexual individuals, and to challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices. This can help create a more inclusive environment where partly asexual casual Buddhists feel valued and respected.
6. Use technology to facilitate participation: Utilize digital platforms and tools to enable partly asexual casual Buddhists to participate in decision-making processes remotely, such as through online surveys or virtual meetings. This can help increase their visibility and representation in decision-making processes.
7. Foster alliances with other marginalized groups: Building relationships and solidarity with other marginalized groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community, can help create a more inclusive environment for partly asexual casual Buddhists.
