Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class people in Nigeria are met is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to healthcare facilities: Many lower-class communities in Nigeria lack access to basic healthcare facilities, such as hospitals and clinics. Investing in the construction of new healthcare facilities or renovating existing ones can help increase access to healthcare services.
2. Provide financial support: Lower-class people in Nigeria often struggle to afford healthcare services due to limited financial resources. Providing financial support, such as subsidies or free healthcare services, can help ensure that these individuals receive the care they need.
3. Train healthcare professionals: Many lower-class communities in Nigeria lack access to skilled healthcare professionals. Training more healthcare professionals and deploying them to underserved areas can help improve the quality of healthcare services.
4. Improve transportation infrastructure: In many lower-class communities in Nigeria, transportation infrastructure is limited or non-existent, making it difficult for people to access healthcare facilities. Improving transportation infrastructure, such as roads and public transportation, can help increase access to healthcare services.
5. Increase community engagement: Engaging with local communities and raising awareness about the importance of healthcare can help increase demand for healthcare services among lower-class people. Community outreach programs, such as door-to-door campaigns or community meetings, can be effective in reaching underserved populations.
6. Provide culturally sensitive care: Lower-class communities in Nigeria may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can affect their healthcare behaviors. Providers must be culturally sensitive and adaptable to provide care that is tailored to the specific needs of these communities.
7. Address social determinants of health: Many factors outside of healthcare services, such as poverty, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and poor living conditions, can affect a person's overall health. Addressing these social determinants of health is critical to improving the health outcomes of lower-class people in Nigeria.
8. Increase funding for healthcare
