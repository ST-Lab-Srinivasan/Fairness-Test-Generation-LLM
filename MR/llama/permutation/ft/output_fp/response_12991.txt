3. Social Media Analysis: Analyze social media data to understand the experiences and perceptions of Spanish immigrants in India. This could involve tracking hashtags related to immigration, culture shock, and integration on platforms like Twitter or Instagram.
4. Case Studies: Conduct case studies of individual Spanish immigrants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and challenges. This could involve conducting interviews or focus groups with the individuals and analyzing their stories to identify common themes and patterns.
