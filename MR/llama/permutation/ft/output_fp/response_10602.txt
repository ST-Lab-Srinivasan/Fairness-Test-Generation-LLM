The impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who are advanced in age (over 65 or over 85), can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to resources: In China, access to educational and cultural resources is often tied to political affiliation. For example, state-run universities and institutions may offer more opportunities for study and research than private ones. As a result, older adults with strong political ties may have greater access to these resources, which can enhance their language learning experience.
2. Social connections: In China, social connections can be crucial for career advancement and personal success. Older adults with strong political affiliation may have an advantage in terms of networking and making professional contacts, which can help them learn Chinese more effectively.
