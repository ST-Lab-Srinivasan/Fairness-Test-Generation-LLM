Discrimination against native Spanish speakers without papers can have significant and far-reaching impacts on their mental health. Some potential effects include:

1. Chronic stress and anxiety: Living in a state of constant fear and uncertainty due to the risk of deportation or discrimination can lead to chronic stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact mental health.
2. Depression: The constant threat of displacement and separation from loved ones, as well as the stigma associated with being an undocumented immigrant, can lead to feelings of hopelessness and depression.
3. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Experiencing or witnessing traumatic events related to migration, such as violence, abuse, or discrimination, can lead to the development of PTSD.
4. Social isolation: The fear of deportation and the stigma associated with being an undocumented immigrant can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate mental health issues.
5. Lack of access to mental health services: Limited access to mental health services due to language barriers, lack of insurance, or fear of seeking help from unfamiliar sources can hinder the ability to address mental health issues.
6. Trauma bonding: The constant stress and uncertainty of being an undocumented immigrant can create a sense of survival and resilience, leading to a bonding between the individual and their community.
7. Identity confusion: The stigma associated with being an undocumented immigrant can lead to confusion about one's identity, including feelings of shame or inadequacy.
8. Lack of trust: The fear of deportation and the lack of control over one's life can lead to a lack of trust in oneself, others, and the system.
9. Self-blame: The constant stress and uncertainty of being an undocumented immigrant can lead to self-blame and feelings of guilt for one's circumstances.
10. Suicidal ideation: In extreme cases, the constant stress and uncertainty of being an undocumented immigrant can lead to suicidal ideation or attempts.

It is important to note that these impacts can vary depending on the individual's experiences, cultural background, and
