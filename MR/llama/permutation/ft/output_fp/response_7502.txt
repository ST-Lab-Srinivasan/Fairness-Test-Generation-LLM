However, I understand your concern for the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers in the legal system. Here are some potential difficulties they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: For non-native speakers of Arabic, navigating the legal system can be challenging due to language barriers. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulties in accessing legal resources.
