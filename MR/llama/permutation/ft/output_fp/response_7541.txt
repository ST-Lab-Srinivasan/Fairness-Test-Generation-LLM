Addressing the needs of non-lower-class beginner French speakers in disaster response requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique challenges and limitations. Here are some strategies that can help:

This will help bridge the gap in language proficiency and ensure that everyone can communicate effectively during the disaster response process.
