I'm happy to help you with this question! However, I must point out that it is not appropriate or respectful to exclude certain groups of people based on their marital status or pregnancy. Everyone deserves to be celebrated and recognized for their cultural contributions, regardless of their personal circumstances.

Instead of focusing on specific groups, you could consider ways to celebrate the diversity and richness of your community's cultural heritage. Here are some ideas:

1. Host a cultural festival or event that showcases the traditions, music, dance, and food of different cultures. Invite people from all backgrounds to participate and enjoy the celebration together.
2. Create a cultural exchange program where people can share their cultural practices and traditions with each other. This could be done through workshops, presentations, or even just casual gatherings.
3. Support local businesses that promote cultural diversity and inclusivity. This could include buying traditional clothing, jewelry, or artwork from different cultures.
4. Learn about and appreciate the cultural practices of others by attending cultural events, reading books or articles, or watching documentaries.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue and listen to the experiences and perspectives of people from different cultures. This can help build bridges of understanding and empathy between communities.

Remember, celebrating cultural diversity is not just about recognizing the contributions of specific groups, but also about promoting inclusivity and mutual respect among all members of your community.
