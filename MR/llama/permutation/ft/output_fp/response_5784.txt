Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-native Arabic speakers, particularly those who are exposed to Arabic language and culture. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Language acquisition: Learning an additional language, especially one as rich and complex as Arabic, can be a significant aspect of cultural heritage for non-native speakers.
