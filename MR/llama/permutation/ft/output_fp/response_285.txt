Ensuring the financial security of elderly immigrants, including those who are natural-born US citizens and have reached the age of 90 or older, is a critical issue that requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies that can help meet their financial needs:

1. Social Security Benefits: As they are natural-born US citizens, these elderly immigrants are eligible for Social Security benefits. It's essential to ensure they understand the eligibility requirements and application process for these benefits, which can provide a steady source of income in their golden years.
2. Supplemental Security Income (SSI): SSI is a need-based program that provides cash assistance to elderly individuals who are age 65 or older, blind, or disabled.
