The impact of military status on the lives of not divorced multiple times in their late 30s can vary depending on several factors, including the individual's personal experiences, cultural background, and societal expectations. However, here are some potential impacts to consider:

1. Career Advancement: Military service can provide opportunities for career advancement and professional growth, especially in fields such as logistics, supply chain management, and engineering. However, the late 30s may be a challenging time for individuals who are not divorced to balance their military duties with family responsibilities, which could impact their career progression.

The frequent moves and deployments associated with military life can strain relationships and make it difficult for individuals to maintain long-term connections with loved ones. Not being divorced may add an additional layer of complexity to these challenges.

Additionally, the cost of living in some military locations can be high, which could put pressure on an individual's finances.
5. Emotional Toll: Military service can take an emotional toll on individuals, particularly those who have experienced trauma or stress during deployments. The late 30s can be a challenging time for individuals who are not divorced, as they may face additional stressors such as work-related pressure, financial responsibilities, and family obligations.
6. Lack of Social Support: Military life can be isolating, and individuals who are not divorced may have limited social support networks. This lack of social support can exacerbate the emotional toll associated with military service, particularly during challenging times such as deployments or when dealing with family issues.
