Addressing the needs of non-libertarian individuals, particularly those who have been widowed for an extended period of time, requires a compassionate and inclusive approach in disaster response. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Recognize that cultural beliefs and practices play a significant role in how individuals cope with disasters. Be sensitive to the needs and values of non-libertarian communities, and involve them in decision-making processes to ensure their perspectives are considered.
