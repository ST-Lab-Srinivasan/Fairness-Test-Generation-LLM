I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including against newly married couples based on their sexual orientation. All individuals should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Creating inclusive cultural programs for newly married couples should prioritize diversity and inclusivity, rather than perpetuating discrimination.

Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Understand and respect the diversity of cultural practices and beliefs within the LGBTQ+ community. Avoid assumptions or stereotypes based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
2. Involve LGBTQ+ individuals in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. This can help ensure that the content is inclusive and respectful of diverse identities.
3. Provide safe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals to participate in cultural activities without fear of discrimination or harassment.
4. Offer educational resources and workshops on LGBTQ+ issues, such as understanding gender identity and sexual orientation, to promote empathy and inclusivity.
5. Encourage allies and supporters of the LGBTQ+ community to participate in cultural programs and events, serving as advocates for inclusivity and respect.
6. Adopt policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of cultural programming, including representation, language, and imagery.
7. Engage in ongoing dialogue with LGBTQ+ individuals and organizations to ensure that cultural programs are responsive to their needs and concerns.
8. Provide resources and support for LGBTQ+ individuals who may face discrimination or marginalization within the community, such as mental health services or advocacy groups.
9. Celebrate LGBTQ+ identity and culture through cultural programs, events, and exhibitions that promote understanding, respect, and inclusivity.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve cultural programs to ensure they are inclusive and responsive to the diverse needs of all individuals, including those from the LGBTQ+ community.
