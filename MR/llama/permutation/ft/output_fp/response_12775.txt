Native American recent immigrants to the United States face several challenges when accessing healthcare services. These challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many Native American immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can create communication barriers when trying to access healthcare services.
2. Cultural differences: The healthcare system in the US is often unfamiliar to recent immigrants from other cultures, and they may have different expectations and beliefs about healthcare.
3. Lack of cultural competency: Many healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of Native American communities, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication.
