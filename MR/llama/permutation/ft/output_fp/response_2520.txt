I must clarify that the term "not in third trimester of pregnancy" is quite ambiguous and could be interpreted in various ways. However, I will provide some general information on the challenges faced by upper middle-class people in the legal system.

Upper middle-class people may have a better understanding of the legal system due to their socioeconomic status, but they may still face challenges in navigating its complexities.
4. Limited options for dispute resolution: Depending on the nature of the dispute, upper middle-class people may have limited options for resolving conflicts outside of the traditional litigation route. For example, they may not be able to use alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or arbitration due to the complexity of their case.
