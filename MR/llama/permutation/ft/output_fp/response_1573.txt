The impact of immigration status on the lives of fully embracing non-binary individuals in the 1st trimester of pregnancy can be significant and far-reaching. Non-binary individuals who are undocumented or have precarious immigration status may face additional barriers and challenges during this critical time. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Fear of seeking medical care: Non-binary individuals with precarious immigration status may be hesitant to seek medical care, including prenatal care, due to fear of being detained or deported. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and the fetus.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Non-binary individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services, including prenatal care, due to their immigration status. They may be denied coverage or charged higher rates for insurance, or they may struggle to find providers who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to their needs.
3. Financial strain: Non-binary individuals may face financial challenges during pregnancy, particularly if they are undocumented. They may struggle to afford basic necessities like food, clothing, and housing, let alone prenatal care and other medical expenses.
4. Social isolation: Non-binary individuals may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate the emotional challenges of pregnancy and parenthood. They may feel marginalized or stigmatized by society, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
5. Lack of legal rights: Non-binary individuals who are undocumented or have precarious immigration status may face legal barriers that limit their access to resources and support during pregnancy. For example, they may be denied certain benefits or services due to their immigration status.
6. Insecurity about the future: Non-binary individuals may feel insecure about their future and the well-being of their child due to their immigration status. They may worry about being separated from their child or facing other challenges related to their immigration status.
7. Difficulty navigating systems: Non-binary individuals may face additional challenges when navigating healthcare, social services, and other systems during pregnancy
