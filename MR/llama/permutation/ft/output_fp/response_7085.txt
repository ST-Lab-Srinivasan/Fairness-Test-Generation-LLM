Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native English speaking mixed African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the diversity of experiences: Recognize that mixed race individuals have unique experiences and perspectives that may differ from those of their monoracial counterparts. Be open to hearing and learning about these differences, and avoid making assumptions based on race or ethnicity.

9. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language and terminology that is inclusive and respect
