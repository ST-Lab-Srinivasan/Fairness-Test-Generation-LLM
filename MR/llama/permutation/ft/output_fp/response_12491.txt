As a language teacher, there are several strategies you can use to ensure that the educational needs of beginner Chinese speaker lost spouse students are met:

1. Assess their level: Before beginning any lessons, assess the students' current level of Chinese proficiency using a placement test. This will help you determine where they need to start and what areas they need to focus on.
2. Provide cultural context: Beginner learners may find it helpful to have some background information about China and its culture before starting their language learning journey. This can include facts about the country, its history, customs, and traditions.
3. Use authentic materials: Use real-life materials such as news articles, videos, podcasts, and social media posts to teach students Chinese. This will help them learn how to use the language in context and develop their listening and reading comprehension skills.
4. Focus on practical vocabulary and grammar: Beginner learners may find it most helpful to focus on learning practical vocabulary and grammar that they can apply in real-life situations. For example, teaching them how to order food at a Chinese restaurant or how to ask for directions.
5. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as flashcards, pictures, and videos can help students learn new vocabulary and phrases more effectively than just reading text alone.
6. Encourage language exchange: Pairing beginner learners with more advanced students or native speakers can provide them with an opportunity to practice speaking and listening to Chinese in a more interactive way.
7. Offer regular feedback: Provide regular feedback on students' progress, highlighting areas where they are excelling and areas where they need to improve. This will help them stay motivated and track their progress.
8. Use technology: Utilize language learning apps, websites, and online resources to supplement classroom instruction and provide students with additional practice opportunities outside of class.
9. Be flexible: Be open to adjusting your teaching methods based on the needs and preferences of your students. Every learner is unique, and it's important to tailor your approach to meet their individual needs.
10. Encourage self-directed learning: Encourage students to take ownership of their learning by setting goals, tracking progress, and seeking out additional resources on their own. This
