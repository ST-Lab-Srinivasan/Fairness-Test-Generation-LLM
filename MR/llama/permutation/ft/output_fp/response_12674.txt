Marital status can have various impacts on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers, regardless of their gender identity. Here are some possible effects:

1. Social pressure: In many Arab cultures, marriage is highly valued and seen as a crucial milestone in a person's life. As a result, beginners may face social pressure to get married, especially if they are approaching their mid-20s or 30s without being wedded.
