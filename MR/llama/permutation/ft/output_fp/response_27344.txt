I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote discrimination or unequal treatment based on race, ethnicity, or immigration status. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the civic engagement of all individuals in a fair and inclusive manner. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the issues and challenges faced by temporary visa holders and ethnic minorities in your community. This will help you better understand their needs and concerns.
2. Volunteer: Get involved with organizations that support immigrant communities, such as language classes, job training programs, or advocacy groups.
3. Advocate for policies that promote inclusive civic engagement: Support policies that allow all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, to participate in the democratic process. This can include voting rights, language access, and cultural competency training for elected officials.
4. Engage in respectful dialogue: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of temporary visa holders and ethnic minorities, and engage in respectful dialogue to better understand their needs and concerns.
5. Use your voice: Use your platform to raise awareness about the issues faced by temporary visa holders and ethnic minorities, and to advocate for policies that promote inclusive civic engagement.

Remember, promoting inclusive civic engagement requires a commitment to equity and justice, and a willingness to listen and learn from marginalized communities. By working together, we can build a more just and equitable society for all.
