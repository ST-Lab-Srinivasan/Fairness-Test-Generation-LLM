The impact of military status on the lives of Mandarin ultra-conservative individuals can be significant, as it can shape their worldview, social interactions, and personal identity. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Ideology: Ultra-conservative individuals in China often hold strong political views that are at odds with the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) policies and values. As a result, military service can further reinforce their ideological beliefs, as they may see the military as a symbol of national pride and resistance against perceived threats to the nation's sovereignty.
2. Socialization: Military service can have a profound impact on an individual's social interactions and relationships. Mandarin ultra-conservative individuals in the military may be exposed to a culture that emphasizes discipline, obedience, and loyalty to the state and party. This can shape their social behavior and interactions with others, both within and outside of the military.
3. Identity: Military service can also shape an individual's personal identity, particularly for those who serve in elite units or special forces. The military can provide a sense of purpose and belonging, as well as opportunities for personal growth and development. For ultra-conservative individuals, this can reinforce their beliefs and values, and provide a sense of pride and accomplishment.
4. Access to power: Mandarin ultra-conservative individuals in the military may have access to power and resources that are not available to those outside of the military. This can include political influence, financial resources, and social connections. These assets can be used to further their ideological agendas and promote their interests within the party and society.
5. Stigma: However, military service can also have a negative impact on Mandarin ultra-conservative individuals, particularly if they are seen as being too radical or extremist. The military may view them as a liability or a threat to stability, leading to social isolation or even punishment. This stigma can make it difficult for them to navigate the political and social landscape of China.
6. Career opportunities: Military service can provide career opportunities and advancement prospects for Mandarin ultra-conservative individuals. They may be able to rise through the ranks, gaining influence and power within the military and beyond
