Ensuring that the healthcare needs of low-earning natural-born Indian citizens are met is a critical issue, particularly in a country where access to quality healthcare is often limited by socio-economic factors. Here are some strategies that can help address this challenge:

1. Increase government spending on healthcare: The Indian government can allocate more resources towards providing quality healthcare to low-income groups. This can include increasing funding for primary healthcare centers, hospitals, and other healthcare infrastructure in underserved areas.
2. Implement universal healthcare: Introduction of a universal healthcare system can help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare, regardless of their economic status. Such a system would provide comprehensive coverage, including preventive care, hospitalization, and medication.
3. Promote community-based healthcare: Community-based healthcare models, such as primary healthcare centers and mobile clinics, can help reach underserved populations. These models can be scaled up to cover a larger area and provide more comprehensive services.
4. Encourage private sector participation: Private sector involvement in healthcare can help increase access to quality care, particularly in rural areas where public health facilities may be limited. This can include partnerships with private hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centers.
5. Provide telemedicine services: Telemedicine can help bridge the gap between underserved populations and quality healthcare. This can include remote consultations, e-consultations, and online medication delivery.
6. Foster public-private partnerships: Collaboration between government, private sector, and civil society organizations can help leverage resources and expertise to improve access to healthcare for low-earning citizens.
7. Develop innovative financing models: Creation of innovative financing mechanisms, such as social impact bonds, can help mobilize resources from private investors to fund healthcare infrastructure and services in underserved areas.
8. Strengthen healthworkforce capacity building: Training and capacity building for healthcare workers, particularly in rural areas, can help improve the quality of care provided to low-earning citizens.
9. Focus on preventive care: Emphasis on preventive care can help reduce healthcare costs in the long run by
