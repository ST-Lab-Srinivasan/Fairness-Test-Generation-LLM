Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are in their third trimester of pregnancy and have been long-term widowed. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care and other medical services due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby's health.
2. Prenatal Care: Long-term widowed individuals who are undocumented may face challenges in accessing prenatal care, including ultrasounds, blood tests, and other medical evaluations. This can make it difficult to detect any potential complications early on, which can lead to serious health problems for both the mother and baby.
3. Birth Location: Undocumented immigrants may be more likely to give birth in a hospital or clinic that is not equipped to handle high-risk pregnancies. This can increase the risk of complications during delivery, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and baby.
4. Family Separation: Long-term widowed individuals who are undocumented may face separation from their children if they are born in a country where they do not have legal status. This can lead to emotional distress and instability for both the parent and child.
5. Economic Stress: Undocumented immigrants may face economic stress due to lack of access to financial resources, which can impact their ability to provide adequately for themselves and their unborn baby. This can lead to malnutrition, poor living conditions, and other adverse outcomes.
6. Social Isolationation: Long-term widowed individuals who are undocumented may face social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and depression. This can impact their mental health and wellbeing, particularly during pregnancy.
7. Lack of Support: Undocumented immigrants may not have access to support systems, such as prenatal classes or postpartum care, which can impact their ability to provide adequately for themselves and their baby.
8. Fear and Anxiety: The stress of living in a country without legal status
