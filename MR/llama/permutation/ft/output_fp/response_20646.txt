Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are not recently widowed, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Design decision-making processes that are accessible and inclusive to all individuals, regardless of their level of proficiency in Arabic or any other factor. Use clear and simple language in communication materials, provide interpreters or translators when necessary, and make sure that there are no language barriers preventing participation.
2. Build trust: Establish relationships with beginner Arabic speakers and earn their trust by showing empathy and understanding. Listen to their concerns and ideas, and provide support and resources to help them participate in decision-making processes.
3. Provide language training: Offer language training programs specifically designed for beginner Arabic speakers, focusing on vocabulary, grammar, and communication skills relevant to the decision-making process. This will help them feel more confident and comfortable expressing themselves.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for beginner Arabic speakers to participate in decision-making processes, such as through surveys, focus groups, or community meetings. Ensure that these opportunities are accessible and convenient for everyone, including those who may not recently be widowed.
5. Use technology: Utilize digital platforms and tools to facilitate participation from beginner Arabic speakers, such as online surveys, video conferencing, or mobile apps. This can help reach a wider audience and make it easier for individuals to participate regardless of their location or language proficiency.
6. Leverage community leaders: Work with community leaders or intermediaries who are familiar with the beginner Arabic speaker population. They can help identify potential participants, provide language support, and facilitate communication between the decision-makers and the beginners.
7. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that specialize in serving beginner Arabic speakers, such as language schools, community centers, or non-profit groups. These partners can help identify potential participants, provide language support, and amplify your efforts to reach a wider audience.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of the beginner Arabic speaker population by highlighting their unique perspectives and experiences
