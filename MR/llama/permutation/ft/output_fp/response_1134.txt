Supporting the economic empowerment of Native American natural-born US citizens who fall within the upper to middle-income bracket requires a comprehensive approach that addresses systemic barriers and provides targeted resources. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Skills Development: Invest in educational programs that provide job training and skills development for Native Americans, focusing on in-demand fields such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and degree programs at tribal colleges or partner institutions.
2. Small Business Development: Encourage entrepreneurship by providing small business loans, mentorship, and technical assistance to Native Americans looking to start or grow their own businesses. This can include funding from the US Small Business Administration (SBA) or programs specifically designed for Native American entrepreneurs.
3. Job Placement and Career Advancement: Offer job placement services and career advancement opportunities for Native Americans, focusing on industries with growth potential. This can include working with major corporations to establish mentorship programs, internships, and full-time employment opportunities.
4. Addressing Systemic Barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent Native Americans from achieving economic success, such as discrimination, lack of access to capital, and limited access to education and job training. This can involve advocating for policy changes at the local, state, or federal level.
5. Community Development: Invest in community development initiatives that promote economic growth and stability within Native American communities. This can include infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, and housing, as well as programs that support cultural preservation and community revitalization.
6. Mentorship and Leadership Development: Provide mentorship and leadership development opportunities for Native Americans, including training and networking events, to help them advance in their careers and become leaders within their communities.
7. Access to Capital: Increase access to capital for Native American entrepreneurs by providing access to venture capital, angel investors, and crowdfunding platforms. This can also involve working with financial institutions to offer tailored loan programs and other financial services.
