Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of not newly married beginner Spanish speakers. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence the identities of these individuals:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For example, a person who grows up speaking Spanish at home and participating in cultural events with their family may feel more connected to their Hispanic heritage than to their national identity.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity by providing a framework for understanding oneself in relation to others. For example, someone who grows up learning about their ancestors and the cultural traditions of their community may develop a strong sense of self that is rooted in their cultural heritage.
3. Cultural practices: Cultural heritage can influence the everyday practices and behaviors of individuals. For instance, a person who grew up celebrating traditional Spanish holidays and festivals with their family may continue to do so as an adult, even if they are no longer newly married.
4. Language use: Language is an important aspect of cultural heritage, and the language one speaks can greatly impact how they perceive themselves and their place in the world. For example, a person who grows up speaking Spanish at home may feel more connected to their Hispanic identity than someone who only speaks English.
5. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, and sexuality, to shape an individual's identity. For example, a person who identifies as both Hispanic and queer may experience a sense of duality in their identity, with each aspect of their heritage influencing how they understand themselves differently.
6. Community ties: Cultural heritage can influence an individual's sense of community and belonging. For instance, someone who grows up participating in cultural events with their family and community may feel a strong sense of connection to that group, which can shape their identity and inform their choices and behaviors.
7. Resistance and subversion: Cultural heritage can also be used as a tool for resistance and subversion. For example, someone who grows up learning about the struggles and triumphs of their ancestors may feel empowered to challenge systems of oppression and work towards social change.
