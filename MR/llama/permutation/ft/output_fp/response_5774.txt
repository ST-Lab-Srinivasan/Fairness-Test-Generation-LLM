3. Offering support services and accommodations to help students who may be struggling academically or socially due to systemic barriers or biases.
4. Creating a safe and welcoming learning environment that promotes mutual respect and understanding among all students, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
5. Encouraging diverse perspectives and voices in the educational setting, through inclusive teaching practices and opportunities for student leadership and participation.

By prioritizing these inclusive and equitable education practices, schools can help ensure that the educational needs of all students are met, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
