4. Community Outreach and Engagement: Engage with native French speaking communities through outreach programs, events, and surveys. This can help gather input from these communities and ensure that their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
5. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Develop inclusive decision-making processes that involve native French speakers throughout the process. This can include involving them in the development of policies, programs, and services.
6. Fostering Relationships: Build relationships with native French speaking communities by engaging in regular communication and providing opportunities for collaboration. This can help establish trust and ensure that their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
