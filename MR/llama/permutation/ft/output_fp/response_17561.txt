There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner French and Chinese speakers:

1. Language Proficiency Tests: Conducting language proficiency tests for both French and Chinese can help identify the areas where learners struggle the most. For example, a test could assess listening comprehension, grammar usage, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. The results of these tests can provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of beginner learners.
2. Learner Corpus Analysis: Analyzing a corpus of written texts produced by beginner French and Chinese learners can help identify common errors, grammatical structures, and vocabulary used. This can help language instructors tailor their teaching to the specific needs of their students.
3. Speech Recognition Technology: Using speech recognition technology to analyze the pronunciation of beginner French and Chinese speakers can help identify areas where they struggle the most. For example, the software could assess the accuracy of vowel and consonant production, intonation, and rhythm.
4. Learner Autobiographies: Asking beginner French and Chinese learners to write autobiographies in their target language can provide valuable insights into their learning experiences. The autobiographies can be analyzed for common themes, such as challenges faced, motivation levels, and strategies used.
5. Surveys and Interviews: Conducting surveys and interviews with beginner French and Chinese learners can help identify their attitudes towards language learning, their learning styles, and the factors that influence their progress. For example, survey questions could ask learners to rate their level of motivation, how often they practice, and what strategies they use to improve their language skills.
6. Language Learning App Usage Data: Analyzing data from language learning apps can provide insights into how beginner French and Chinese learners use technology to learn languages. For example, the data could reveal which features are used most frequently, how much time learners spend on each feature, and which areas of language learning are most challenging for them.
7. Neuroimaging Studies: Using neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG) can help identify the neural mechanisms underlying language learning. For
