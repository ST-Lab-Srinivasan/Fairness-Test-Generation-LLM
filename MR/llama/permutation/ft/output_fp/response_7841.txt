The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-disabled individuals can be significant and far-reaching, affecting various aspects of their well-being. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Non-disabled individuals with uncertain or undocumented immigration status may face barriers when accessing healthcare services, including preventive care, emergency care, and mental health services. They might be hesitant to seek medical attention due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage.
2. Employment and Economic Stability: Undocumented immigrants are often unable to access certain job opportunities or advance in their careers due to their immigration status. They may face discrimination, exploitation, or wage theft, which can impact their economic stability and overall well-being.
3. Housing and Living Situation: Non-disabled individuals with uncertain immigration status might struggle to find affordable and secure housing, leading to overcrowding, substandard living conditions, or homelessness. This can exacerbate mental health issues, social isolation, and other challenges.
4. Social Isolation and Stigma: Immigration status can lead to social isolation, as individuals may be reluctant to disclose their immigration status to friends, family, or colleagues due to fear of rejection or persecution. This can result in feelings of loneliness, low self-esteem, and reduced opportunities for social support.
5. Education and Career Advancement: Non-disabled individuals with uncertain immigration status might face challenges when pursuing higher education or professional advancement due to restrictions on their access to financial aid, scholarships, or professional licenses. This can limit their future career prospects and earning potential.
6. Family Separation and Reunification: Undocumented immigrants may be separated from their families due to deportation or detention. Reuniting with family members can be a significant challenge, especially if the individual is unable to return to their country of origin due to political instability, violence, or other factors.
7. Mental Health and Trauma: The stress and uncertainty surrounding immigration status can lead to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
