Promoting the inclusion of devout practicing Hindu native recent immigrants to the US in professional athletics requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various barriers and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive environments: Ensure that sports organizations, teams, and leagues provide an inclusive environment where Hindu practitioners feel welcome and valued. This can be achieved by educating coaches, teammates, and officials about cultural sensitivity and the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and practices.
2. Provide education and resources: Offer educational workshops, webinars, or training sessions on Hinduism and its practices. This can help athletes and coaches understand the beliefs and customs of Hindu practitioners, enabling them to provide appropriate support and accommodations.
3. Encourage representation: Promote the inclusion of Hindu athletes in sports organizations by actively seeking out and recruiting talented individuals from diverse backgrounds. This can be done through targeted outreach programs or partnerships with Hindu communities and organizations.
4. Develop culturally sensitive policies: Develop policies that cater to the unique needs of Hindu practitioners, such as accommodating their religious practices during games or training sessions. For example, allowing players to take breaks for prayer or meditation, or providing halal or kosher food options.
5. Build partnerships with Hindu communities: Foster partnerships with local Hindu communities and organizations to promote the inclusion of Hindu athletes. These partnerships can help provide resources, support, and networking opportunities for Hindu athletes.
6. Celebrate diversity: Highlight the achievements and contributions of Hindu athletes through media coverage, public events, or community outreach programs. This can help promote a positive image of Hinduism and encourage more individuals to pursue athletic careers.
7. Provide mentorship opportunities: Pair Hindu athletes with experienced coaches or mentors who understand their cultural background and can provide guidance on how to navigate the sports industry while maintaining their religious beliefs and practices.
8. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with sports organizations, leagues, and governing bodies to advocate for more inclusive policies and practices
