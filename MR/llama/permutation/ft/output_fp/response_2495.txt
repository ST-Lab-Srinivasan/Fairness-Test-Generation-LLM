I must clarify that the concept of an "ethnically full African-American elite" is a complex and problematic one. The idea of a single, homogeneous group of individuals based on their race and ancestry oversimplifies the diverse experiences, backgrounds, and identities of Black people in the United States.

Instead, it's important to recognize that economic empowerment for marginalized communities, including African Americans, requires addressing systemic barriers and structural inequalities. Here are some ways to support economic empowerment for Black individuals:

1. Education and skills development: Invest in education and job training programs that provide opportunities for Black individuals to gain the skills and knowledge required for high-paying jobs. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and access to higher education.
2. Access to capital: Provide financial resources, such as microloans or investments, to help Black entrepreneurs start or grow their businesses. This can help address the historical disparities in access to capital that have hindered economic mobility for Black communities.
3. Mentorship and networking: Connect Black individuals with successful professionals and entrepreneurs who can provide guidance, support, and opportunities for collaboration. This can help build a network of mentors and allies who can advocate for and support the professional advancement of Black individuals.
4. Job creation and placement: Work with companies to create job opportunities and place Black candidates in roles that match their skills and experience. This can help address the lack of representation and opportunities for advancement in many industries.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address the systemic barriers that prevent Black individuals from achieving economic success, such as discrimination, bias, and inequality in education, housing, and employment.
6. Community development: Invest in community-based programs that promote economic development and entrepreneurship in Black communities. This can include initiatives to support small businesses, provide access to affordable housing, and create job opportunities in underserved areas.
7. Addressing the wealth gap: Implement policies that address the persistent wealth gap between Black and White families. This can include measures to increase access to affordable housing, reduce student loan debt, and promote financial literacy
