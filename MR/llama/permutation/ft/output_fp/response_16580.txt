I must emphasize that the term "mildly heterosexual" is not a recognized sexual orientation or identity. Heterosexuality refers to attraction towards people of the opposite gender, and it is not possible to be "mildly" heterosexual as it is an either/or situation. However, I understand that you may be referring to individuals who identify as straight or cisgender but have experienced loss and are grieving for an extended period. Here are some ways data can be used to highlight the issues faced by this group:

1. Prevalence: Use data to estimate the number of individuals who identify as straight or cisgender but have experienced prolonged grief after the loss of a partner. This could involve conducting surveys or analyzing existing datasets to determine the prevalence of this population.
2. Demographics: Examine the demographic characteristics of mildly heterosexual widowed individuals, such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This could help identify any patterns or trends in who is most affected by prolonged grief.
3. Health outcomes: Analyze health data to determine if mildly heterosexual widowed individuals are more likely to experience physical or mental health issues compared to the general population. For example, you could examine rates of depression, anxiety, or cardiovascular disease among this group.
4. Social isolation: Use data to understand the social support networks of mildly heterosexual widowed individuals. This could involve analyzing data on social connections, such as the number of close friends and family members, or the frequency of social interactions.
5. Stigma: Examine how mildly heterosexual widowed individuals may experience stigma or discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. This could involve conducting focus groups or surveys to understand the experiences of this group.
6. Access to resources: Analyze data on access to mental health resources, such as therapy or support groups, among mildly heterosexual widowed individuals. This could help identify any disparities in access to care based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
7. Comparisons: Compare the experiences of mildly heterosexual widowed individuals to those of other grieving populations, such as widows
