Creating more inclusive social policies for working-class bereaved individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this group. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the role of class in grief: Recognize that bereavement is shaped by socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, lack of access to resources, and social isolation. Addressing these underlying issues is crucial for promoting equity in bereavement support.
2. Increase access to mental health services: Working-class individuals may face barriers to accessing mental health services due to financial constraints or lack of knowledge about available resources. Ensure that mental health support is accessible and affordable for all, regardless of economic status.
3. Address systemic issues: Identify and address systemic issues that contribute to the marginalization of working-class individuals, such as discrimination, stigma, and power imbalances. This can involve advocating for policy changes, increasing diversity in decision-making spaces, and promoting community engagement.
4. Prioritize prevention: Addressing the root causes of grief and trauma, such as poverty, violence, and discrimination, is crucial for promoting mental health and well-being. Invest in prevention initiatives that address these issues and promote social justice.
5. Foster community connections: Working-class individuals may experience social isolation due to lack of access to social networks or resources. Encourage community connections by providing affordable spaces for socialization, promoting volunteer opportunities, and facilitating peer support groups.
6. Provide financial support: Financial strain can exacerbate the impact of bereavement on working-class individuals. Offer financial assistance, such as funeral expense coverage or emergency funds, to help alleviate some of the economic burden.
7. Challenge cultural narratives: Challenging cultural narratives that perpetuate classism and stigma can help promote more inclusive attitudes towards bereavement. Encourage diverse representation in media and popular culture, and facilitate dialogue about the experiences of working-class individuals.
8. Address ageism: Older adults may face additional challenges in accessing support services due to ageism.
