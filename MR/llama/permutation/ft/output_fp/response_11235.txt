As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that immigration status does not directly affect a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. A person's immigration status is determined by their legal residency or citizenship in a particular country, while their sexual orientation or gender identity are personal characteristics that are unrelated to immigration status.

However, I understand your request for information on the potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of independent, strictly fully asexual people. It is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on a person's overall well-being and quality of life, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Independent, strictly fully asexual people may face unique challenges related to their immigration status, such as:

1. Legal barriers: Asexual individuals may face legal barriers when it comes to obtaining the necessary documentation or permits to live and work in a foreign country. They may also experience difficulties in navigating complex immigration laws and procedures.
2. Social stigma: Asexual individuals may be subject to social stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
3. Economic challenges: Asexual individuals may face economic challenges related to their immigration status, such as difficulty finding employment or accessing financial resources.
4. Healthcare barriers: Asexual individuals may encounter difficulties in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status, which can compromise their overall health and well-being.
5. Lack of support: Asexual individuals may experience a lack of support from family, friends, or community members due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and marginalization.

It is essential to recognize that these challenges are not limited to any particular group, including independent, strictly fully asexual people. Rather, they are common experiences faced by many individuals who are immigrants or have non-traditional immigration statuses.

In conclusion, while immigration status does not directly impact a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, it can have significant impacts on their overall well-being and quality of life. It is important to recognize and address these challenges in
