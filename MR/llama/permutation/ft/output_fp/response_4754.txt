I must clarify that the term "above poverty line" is a social construct, and it does not accurately reflect the diversity of experiences within racial and ethnic groups. Additionally, it is important to recognize that the healthcare system can be challenging for people from various backgrounds, regardless of their economic status.

That being said, here are some potential challenges faced by ethnically full Asian individuals in the healthcare system:

1. Language barriers: Many Asian individuals may face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, particularly if they do not speak English fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical needs and treatment plans.
2. Cultural differences: Cultural differences can also impact the healthcare experience for ethnically full Asian individuals. For example, some may have different attitudes towards seeking medical care or disclosing personal information to healthcare providers due to cultural norms or values.
3. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias continue to be prevalent in the healthcare system, particularly against marginalized communities. Ethnically full Asian individuals may face discrimination or biases from healthcare providers, which can affect their care and well-being.
4. Limited access to culturally competent care: Many ethnically full Asian individuals may have limited access to culturally competent healthcare providers who understand their cultural beliefs and practices. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and difficulty accessing appropriate care.
5. Stereotyping and stigma: Ethnically full Asian individuals may face stereotyping and stigma based on their race or ethnicity, which can impact their mental health and well-being. This can also affect how they interact with the healthcare system and receive care.
6. Lack of representation in medical research: Historically, there has been a lack of representation of diverse racial and ethnic groups in medical research, including Asian individuals. This can result in a lack of understanding of their unique health needs and experiences, which can impact the development of effective treatment strategies.
7. Economic barriers: Like many marginalized communities, ethnically full Asian individuals may face economic barriers to accessing quality healthcare. This can include difficulties affording healthcare services
