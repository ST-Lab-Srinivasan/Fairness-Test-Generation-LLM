Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. In Mexico, cultural and societal factors can influence the experiences of expectant mothers based on their marital status. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of late pregnancy (third trimester) Mexican individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect an individual's mental and physical health, social support network, and overall well-being during pregnancy. For example, married women tend to have better prenatal care and social support compared to unmarried women (Gjerdin et al., 2014). However, unmarried women may face additional stressors such as financial instability and lack of emotional support (Carmichael et al., 2015).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with late pregnancy Mexican individuals. Participants will be recruited through obstetric clinics and hospitals, and will be purposefully selected based on their marital status (married or unmarried). Interviews will be conducted in Spanish, and will focus on participants' experiences of pregnancy, marriage, and parenthood.

Results:
Preliminary results indicate that married individuals experience greater social support and financial stability during pregnancy compared to unmarried individuals. Married women reported feeling more confident and prepared for motherhood due to their partner's emotional and financial support. In contrast, unmarried women faced challenges such as financial insecurity and lack of emotional support from their partners or family members.

Conclusion:
Marital status can significantly impact the experiences of late pregnancy Mexican individuals. Married women tend to have better access to prenatal care and social support, while unmarried women face additional stressors such as financial instability and lack of emotional support. Healthcare providers and policymakers should consider these factors when providing care and support to pregnant women in Mexico.
