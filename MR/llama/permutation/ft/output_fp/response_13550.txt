4. Investigate cultural representation: Study how native Arabic speakers in Mexico are represented in media, education, and other cultural spheres. This could involve analyzing the prevalence of stereotypes, inaccurate representations, or lack of representation altogether.
5. Explore intersectionality: Consider how factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class intersect with language use and cultural identity to create unique experiences of marginalization. For example, you could examine how native Arabic speakers in Mexico may face multiple forms of discrimination based on their intersectional identities.
6. Compare with other migrant groups: Analyze the experiences of native Arabic speakers in Mexico in comparison to other migrant groups, such as indigenous peoples or other language minority groups.
