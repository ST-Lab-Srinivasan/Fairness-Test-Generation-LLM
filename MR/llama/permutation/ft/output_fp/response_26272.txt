Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers with mixed Hispanic heritage requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive and appealing to this diverse audience:

1. Understand the diversity of Hispanic cultures: Recognize that "Hispanic" is an umbrella term encompassing various ethnicities, such as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, and more.
