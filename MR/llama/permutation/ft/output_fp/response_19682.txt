Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Spanish speaker immigrant natural-born US citizen individuals requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

2. Bilingual Programming: Offer bilingual programming that caters to both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking populations. This can include bilingual events, workshops, and classes that promote cross-cultural exchange and understanding.
3. Inclusive Language: Use inclusive language in all marketing materials, programs, and signage. Avoid using language that could be perceived as offensive or exclusive to any particular group.
4. Partnerships with Latinx Organizations: Develop partnerships with local Latinx organizations to co-host events, share resources, and leverage each other's networks and expertise. This can help build trust and credibility within the community.

9. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in program planning and decision-making. This can help ensure that the programs are relevant and meaningful to the communities they serve.
