Discrimination against Native Chinese Speaker Temporary Visa Holders: Mental Health Impacts

Introduction

Temporary visa holders from China face significant discrimination in various aspects of life, including employment, education, and housing. As a result, they experience mental health challenges that can have long-term effects on their well-being.

Impact of Discrimination on Mental Health

1. Increased Stress and Anxiety: NCSHTVHs face discriminatory practices, such as unequal access to jobs, housing, and healthcare, which lead to increased stress and anxiety levels. The constant fear of being deported or marginalized can result in chronic stress, affecting their mental health negatively.
2. Low Self-Esteem: Discrimination can cause NCSHTVHs to feel inferior and unworthy, leading to low self-esteem. This can lead to depression, social withdrawal, and other mental health issues.
3. Social Isolation: NCSHTVHs may experience social isolation due to discrimination, which can exacerbate mental health issues. They may feel unwelcome in their communities, leading to a lack of social connections and support networks.
