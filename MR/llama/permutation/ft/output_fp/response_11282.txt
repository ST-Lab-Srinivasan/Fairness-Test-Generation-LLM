I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or prejudice, including those based on a person's immigration status. Everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status.

It is important to recognize that immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, including natural-born citizens. For instance, undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities, which can affect their overall well-being and quality of life.

On the other hand, natural-born citizens who hold ultra-conservative beliefs may also face challenges based on their political views. For example, they may experience discrimination or marginalization within their communities or society at large due to their beliefs.

In both cases, it is crucial to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or political beliefs. Promoting inclusivity, understanding, and empathy towards all individuals can help build a more equitable and just society.
