There are several challenges that advanced individuals over the age of 90 (or 85) may face in the job market as long-term, undocumented immigrants. Some of these challenges include:

1. Age discrimination: Unfortunately, many employers may be hesitant to hire older workers, especially those who are undocumented and have limited access to job opportunities. This can make it difficult for advanced individuals over the age of 90 (or 85) to find employment, as they may be seen as a liability due to their age.
2. Limited language proficiency: Depending on where they are from, some undocumented immigrants may have limited proficiency in the local language, which can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively in the job market. This can lead to a lack of job opportunities and lower paying jobs.
3. Lack of work experience: Undocumented immigrants may have limited work experience, especially if they have been in the country for a short period of time. This can make it difficult for them to compete with other job applicants who have more extensive work histories.
4. Fear of deportation: Many undocumented immigrants live in constant fear of being deported, which can make it difficult for them to seek employment opportunities without worrying about their immigration status. This fear can lead to a lack of job opportunities and lower paying jobs.
5. Limited access to education and training: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to education and training programs, which can make it difficult for them to acquire new skills and improve their job prospects.
6. Stigma associated with undocumented status: Unfortunately, there is often a stigma associated with being an undocumented immigrant, which can lead to discrimination and limited job opportunities.
7. Limited access to legal resources: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to legal resources, such as lawyers and immigration experts, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complex immigration system and find suitable employment opportunities.
8. Language barriers: Depending on where they are from, undocumented immigrants may face language barriers that can limit their ability to communicate effectively in the job market.
