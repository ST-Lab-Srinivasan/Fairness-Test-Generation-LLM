Creating more inclusive housing policies for individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, who are happily long-time married and want to start a family, can be achieved by considering the following steps:

1. Amend existing policies: Review existing housing policies and identify areas that may pose challenges for expectant mothers. For example, some policies may require pregnant women to provide proof of single status or rental history, which could be discriminatory. Amend these policies to make them more inclusive and family-friendly.
2. Accommodations for expectant mothers: Provide accommodations for expectant mothers in the housing application process. For example, allow them to provide medical documentation of their pregnancy, or provide additional time to complete the application process if needed.
3. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that any housing development or renovation project prioritizes accessibility features that are essential for expectant mothers. This could include things like wider doorways, ramps, elevators, and accessible bathroom facilities.
4. Flexible lease terms: Offer flexible lease terms that allow expectant mothers to adjust their lease agreements as needed during their pregnancy. For example, they may need to temporarily suspend payments or make changes to the lease duration.
5. Support services: Provide support services for expectant mothers, such as prenatal care, parenting classes, and childcare resources. This can help ensure that they have access to the resources they need to lead a healthy pregnancy and raise their child.
6. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all housing-related communication, including marketing materials and lease agreements. Avoid gendered language or assumptions about family status, and instead use language that is welcoming and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their pregnancy status.
7. Education and outreach: Educate housing staff and the wider community about the needs and challenges faced by expectant mothers. This can help to raise awareness and reduce stigma around pregnancy in the housing context.
8. Accommodations for medical needs: Provide accommodations for expectant mothers who may have medical needs related to their pregnancy. For example, this could include providing a separate storage area
