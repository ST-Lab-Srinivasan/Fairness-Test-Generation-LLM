Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers as native recent immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their needs and interests: Conduct research or surveys to understand the needs and interests of the target audience. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their specific cultural and linguistic needs.
2. Develop culturally sensitive programs: Design programs that are respectful of Arabic culture and language. This may involve incorporating elements of Arabic culture, such as music, dance, or art, into the program.
3. Provide beginner-friendly content: Create content that is accessible to beginners in terms of language proficiency. Use simple language and avoid complex cultural references or idioms that may be difficult for non-native speakers to understand.
4. Offer language support: Provide interpreters, translators, or language classes specifically designed for Arabic speakers who are recent immigrants. This will help them navigate the program more easily.
5. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for participants to connect with each other and build relationships. Encourage cross-cultural exchange and communication to foster a sense of belonging.
6. Provide culturally sensitive marketing materials: Develop marketing materials that are tailored to the target audience's cultural background. Use language and imagery that is respectful and inclusive.
7. Involve the community: Engage with local Arabic-speaking communities in the planning and implementation of programs. This will help ensure that the content is relevant and appealing to the target audience.
8. Offer flexible programming options: Provide a variety of program formats, such as evening classes or weekend workshops, to accommodate different schedules and preferences.
9. Provide resources for cultural orientation: Offer resources, such as books, videos, or websites, that provide information about Arabic culture and customs. This will help participants better understand the cultural context of the program.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the effectiveness of your programs and make adjustments based on feedback from participants. Encourage participants to share their thoughts and suggestions on how to improve the program.
