Protecting the legal rights of any individual, including those who identify as left-leaning or casual Buddhists, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their rights. Here are some ways to ensure their protection:

1. Constitutional guarantees: Ensure that the country's constitution provides for the protection of religious freedom and non-discrimination. This can include provisions for the right to practice any religion without fear of persecution, the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and belief, and the right to equality before the law.
2. Anti-discrimination laws: Enact and enforce laws that prohibit discrimination based on religious affiliation, including those who identify as left-leaning or casual Buddhists. This can include laws against hate crimes, employment discrimination, and educational discrimination.
3. Protection of sacred sites: Ensure the protection of sacred sites and monuments associated with Buddhism, such as temples, shrines, and other religious structures. This can involve designating these sites as cultural or historical heritage properties and providing legal protections against their desecration or destruction.
4. Promotion of interfaith dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and cooperation between Buddhists and other religious groups to promote mutual understanding, respect, and coexistence. This can involve organizing joint events, conferences, and seminars, as well as promoting education and cultural exchange programs.
5. Support for Buddhist communities: Provide support and resources to Buddhist communities, including financial assistance, legal aid, and access to social services. This can help to strengthen their capacity to advocate for their rights and interests.
6. Encouraging pluralism and diversity: Promote a culture of pluralism and diversity by recognizing and celebrating the diverse religious and cultural practices within the country. This can involve promoting education and awareness about different religions and cultures, as well as challenging discriminatory attitudes and behaviors.
7. Providing access to legal resources: Ensure that Buddhists have access to legal resources and support, including lawyers, legal clinics, and other organizations that can provide advice and representation on issues related to their rights.
8. Encouraging peaceful resolution
