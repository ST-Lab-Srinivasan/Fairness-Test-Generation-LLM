The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant individuals, especially those who are in their third trimester, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Pregnant individuals may face barriers in accessing prenatal care due to their immigration status. They may be afraid to seek medical attention for fear of being detained or deported. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby's health.
2. Fear and stress: Living in a constant state of uncertainty due to immigration status can cause significant fear and stress, particularly during pregnancy. This can affect the mother's mental health and well-being, as well as the developing fetus. Chronic stress can lead to premature birth, low birth weight, and other complications.
3. Social isolation: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented or in a mixed-status household may avoid social interactions due to fear of being discovered by immigration authorities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
4. Limited access to resources: Undocumented individuals may face barriers in accessing essential resources such as food, clothing, and housing. This can exacerbate existing health disparities and increase the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented or in a mixed-status household may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, community members, and even their own families. This can lead to feelings of shame and isolation, which can negatively impact mental health and pregnancy outcomes.
6. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can cause significant anxiety and stress for pregnant individuals, particularly if they are undocumented. This fear can lead to avoidance of medical care and other essential services, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
7. Limited access to financial resources: Undocumented individuals may face barriers in accessing financial resources, such as Medicaid or other government programs. This can limit their ability to cover the costs of prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care.
8. Lack of support:
