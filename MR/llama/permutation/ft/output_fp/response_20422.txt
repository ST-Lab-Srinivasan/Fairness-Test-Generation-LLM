I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic-based discrimination. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, should be treated with respect and dignity.

Asian hardcore socialists, like any other individual, have the right to their own identity and beliefs, which are shaped by a complex array of factors, including cultural heritage, personal experiences, and political beliefs. It is important to recognize that no one's identity should be reduced to a single aspect, such as their race or ethnicity, and that all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect.

Rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or assumptions based on race or ethnicity, it is important to strive for greater understanding, empathy, and inclusivity. By recognizing the diversity of experiences and perspectives within any given group, we can work towards a more equitable and just society for all.

In short, cultural heritage can play a role in shaping the identities of individuals, but it should not be used to marginalize or oppress any particular group. All individuals have the right to their own identity and should be treated with dignity and respect.
