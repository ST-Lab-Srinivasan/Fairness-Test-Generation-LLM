As a beginner Chinese speaker and a recent immigrant to the US, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging. Here are some of the common challenges that you may face:

1. Language Barrier: The legal system in the US is primarily based on English, which can create a significant barrier for non-native speakers. You may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents, which can make it difficult to access justice.
2. Lack of Legal Knowledge: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not be familiar with the US legal system, laws, and regulations. This lack of knowledge can lead to misunderstandings and missteps when dealing with legal issues.
