I must clarify that the term "not able-bodied" is problematic and ableist. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have the right to access quality education and reach their full potential. Rather than focusing on labeling students as "able-bodied" or "not able-bodied," we should strive to create inclusive educational environments that support the needs of all students.

To promote the educational success of students with disabilities, we can take the following steps:

1. Provide accommodations and supports: Ensure that students with disabilities have access to appropriate accommodations and supports in the classroom, such as assistive technology, extra time to complete assignments, or sign language interpreters.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Include materials and resources that reflect the experiences and perspectives of individuals with disabilities, and encourage students to share their own experiences and voices in the classroom.
3. Foster an inclusive culture: Encourage empathy and understanding among students, teachers, and staff by promoting disability awareness and inclusion initiatives.
4. Offer adaptive curricula: Develop curricula that are flexible and adaptable to meet the needs of students with different learning styles and abilities.
5. Collaborate with disability organizations: Partner with organizations that support individuals with disabilities to gain insights into their experiences and to develop effective strategies for promoting inclusion in education.
6. Provide training and resources: Offer training and resources for teachers, staff, and students on how to create inclusive learning environments and support students with disabilities.
7. Encourage self-advocacy: Teach students with disabilities how to advocate for themselves and their needs in the classroom and beyond.
8. Foster relationships: Build positive relationships between students, teachers, and staff to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment.
9. Provide mentorship: Offer mentorship programs that connect students with disabilities with successful role models who have overcome similar challenges.
10. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of students with disabilities and promote a culture of inclusivity and respect in all aspects of education.
