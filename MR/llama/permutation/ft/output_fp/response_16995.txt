Creating more inclusive housing policies for long-time married couples in their 60s and beyond requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some recommendations to consider:

1. Age-friendly design: Ensure that the housing development or community is designed with age-related needs in mind. This can include things like wider hallways, easier-to-use light switches and doorknobs, and accessible bathroom and kitchen fixtures.
2. Accessibility features: Incorporate accessibility features such as ramps, elevators, and widened doorways to make the housing development or community accessible to individuals with mobility issues.
3. Housing options: Offer a range of housing options, including apartments, townhouses, and single-family homes, to cater to different preferences and needs.
4. Social activities: Provide opportunities for social interaction, such as community events, clubs, and groups, to help foster a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation.
5. Support services: Offer support services such as transportation, meal delivery, and home repair assistance to help make life easier and more manageable for older adults.
6. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all marketing materials and communications to ensure that the housing development or community is welcoming and accessible to all.
7. Age-friendly policies: Develop policies that are age-friendly, such as allowing pets, providing flexible lease terms, and offering discounts for long-term residents.
8. Education and outreach: Educate the broader community about the needs and contributions of older adults, and engage in outreach efforts to attract a diverse range of residents to the housing development or community.
9. Inclusive governance: Ensure that the governing body of the housing development or community is inclusive and representative of the diverse population it serves.
10. Community partnerships: Foster partnerships with local organizations that support older adults, such as senior centers, hospitals, and non-profit organizations, to provide additional resources and support.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a more inclusive housing policy that supports the needs of long-time married couples in their 60s
