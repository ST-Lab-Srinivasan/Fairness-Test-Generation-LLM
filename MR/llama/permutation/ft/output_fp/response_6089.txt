Ensuring the healthcare needs of non-middle-class people in Mexico requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and political determinants of health. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Universal Health Coverage: Implementing universal health coverage (UHC) can help ensure that everyone has access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their income or social status. UHC involves pooling funds from various sources, including the government, employers, and individuals, to cover healthcare costs.
2. Community-based Healthcare: Building community-based healthcare models can help reach marginalized populations that may not have access to formal healthcare services. Mobile clinics, community health workers, and village health teams can provide primary care and promote preventive measures in underserved areas.
3. Promoting Social Determinants of Health: Addressing the social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, housing, and employment, is crucial for improving health outcomes. Policies that support affordable housing, access to quality education, and job training programs can help reduce health disparities.
4. Strengthening Primary Care: Developing a robust primary care system can help identify health problems early on and provide continuous care. This includes investing in infrastructure, training healthcare workers, and promoting community-based primary care models.
5. Addressing Health Inequalities: Mexico has significant regional disparities in access to healthcare services. Addressing these inequalities through targeted interventions can help reduce health gaps between regions. For example, the Mexican government has launched programs to improve access to healthcare in rural and indigenous communities.
6. Encouraging Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between public and private sectors can help scale up healthcare services and increase efficiency. Private organizations can provide technical expertise and resources, while the government can ensure regulation and oversight.
7. Investing in Mental Health: Mental health is often overlooked in low- and middle-income countries, but it's a critical component of overall health. Investing in mental health services, including training for healthcare workers and increasing access to psychiatric care, can help address the needs of marginalized populations.
