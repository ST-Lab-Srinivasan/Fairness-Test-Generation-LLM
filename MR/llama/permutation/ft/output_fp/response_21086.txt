To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish and French speakers, you can analyze various metrics related to language learning progress, retention, and proficiency. Here are some potential data-driven insights:

1. Language learning progress: Analyze the rate at which learners progress from one level to another. This could involve tracking the number of students who pass a certain level or the time it takes for students to reach a specific proficiency level. You might find that some groups, such as beginner French speakers, take longer than others to progress through the levels.
2. Retention rates: Examine how many learners retain their language skills over time. This could involve tracking the number of students who continue learning after a certain period or comparing retention rates between different language groups (e.g., beginner Spanish speakers vs. intermediate French speakers). You might find that some groups have higher retention rates than others, indicating a greater ability to maintain and build upon their language skills.
3. Proficiency levels: Assess the proficiency levels of learners in both languages using standardized tests or evaluations from instructors. This could involve tracking the number of students who reach a certain level of proficiency or comparing the average proficiency scores between different language groups (e.g., beginner Spanish speakers vs. intermediate French speakers). You might find that some groups have lower proficiency levels than others, indicating a greater need for additional support or resources.
4. Learning styles: Analyze how learners prefer to learn their target languages, such as through self-study, classroom instruction, or with the help of technology. This could involve surveying learners or analyzing their usage patterns (e.g., which language learning apps they use). You might find that beginner French speakers have different learning styles than beginner Spanish speakers, which could inform tailored instructional approaches.
5. Demographic data: Examine demographic information about the learners, such as age, gender, education level, and occupation. This could help identify potential factors that influence language learning progress (e.g., older learners may face more challenges due to cognitive decline). You might find that beginner French speakers have different demographics than beginner Spanish speakers, which could inform tailored instructional approaches.
