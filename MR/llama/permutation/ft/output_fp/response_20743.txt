Supporting the social inclusion of casual Buddhist people can be done through various means, including:

1. Education and awareness-raising: Provide educational resources and workshops on Buddhism and its principles to help non-Buddhists understand and appreciate the religion. This can also help casual Buddhists feel more confident in their beliefs and practices.
2. Inclusive language and terminology: Use inclusive language and terminology when referring to Buddhist practices and beliefs, avoiding language that may be offensive or alienating to non-Buddhists.
3. Accessibility: Make Buddhist spaces and events accessible to people of all backgrounds and abilities. This can include providing accommodations for people with disabilities, offering online resources and events, and creating safe and welcoming spaces for everyone.
4. Interfaith dialogue and collaboration: Encourage interfaith dialogue and collaboration between Buddhists and non-Buddhists to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can involve organizing joint events and discussions, and engaging in open and respectful communication.
5. Community outreach and engagement: Reach out to local communities and engage with them through activities such as volunteering, cultural events, and educational workshops. This can help build bridges between Buddhists and non-Buddhists and promote a sense of shared community and social inclusion.
6. Supporting marginalized groups: Specifically support marginalized groups within the Buddhist community, such as women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people of color. This can involve creating safe spaces for these groups, providing resources and support, and advocating for their rights and inclusion.
7. Encouraging diverse representation: Encourage diverse representation within the Buddhist community, by actively seeking out and promoting the voices and perspectives of marginalized groups. This can involve creating opportunities for these groups to share their experiences and insights, and amplifying their voices through various channels.
8. Building bridges with other religions: Build bridges between Buddhism and other religions by engaging in interfaith dialogue and collaboration, and promoting mutual understanding and respect. This can involve learning about and appreciating the beliefs and practices of other religions, and finding common ground and shared values
