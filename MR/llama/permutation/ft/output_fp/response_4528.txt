Poor women face significant challenges in accessing and receiving quality healthcare, particularly in developing countries. Some of the common challenges faced by poor women in the healthcare system include:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Many poor women live in rural areas or slums, where healthcare facilities are scarce or non-existent. Even when healthcare facilities are available, they may be too far away or difficult to reach, making it challenging for women to access medical care.
