Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who have been recently divorced multiple times, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language Support: Provide language support and resources to help these individuals improve their English proficiency. This could include language classes, translation services, or access to bilingual staff who can interpret and facilitate communication.
2. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and accessible to all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency. This could involve using visual aids, simplified language, or interpreters to help bridge the language gap.
3. User-Friendly Information: Make information available in multiple languages and formats to accommodate different learning styles and preferences. This could include written materials, videos, or audio recordings.
4. Building Trust: Build trust with these individuals by being responsive to their needs, maintaining confidentiality, and demonstrating empathy. By building rapport and establishing a connection, they may be more likely to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.
5. Peer Mentorship: Pair beginner English speakers with more fluent speakers who can provide guidance and support. This could involve mentoring or buddy systems, where more experienced individuals act as role models and provide language support.
6. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation by providing opportunities for these individuals to connect with others who share similar experiences. This could involve organizing social events, support groups, or cultural activities that promote interaction and connection.
7. Technology-Based Solutions: Leverage technology to facilitate communication and collaboration. For example, using video conferencing tools can help bridge the language gap for remote meetings or virtual discussions.
8. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers to better understand the experiences and perspectives of beginner English speakers. This could involve learning about their cultural backgrounds, values, and communication styles.
9. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow these individuals to provide input on decision-making processes. This could involve setting up regular check-ins or creating a forum for them to share their thoughts and concerns.
