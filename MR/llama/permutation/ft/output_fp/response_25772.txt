Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper middle-income and non-recently single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. Here are some suggestions:

1. Address income inequality: Non-upper middle-income individuals often face financial struggles, making it difficult to access basic necessities like healthcare, education, and housing. Implement policies that promote economic mobility, such as progressive taxation, affordable healthcare, and access to quality education for all.
2. Challenge gender stereotypes: Gender roles and expectations can limit the opportunities and choices available to individuals based on their gender. Policies that challenge these stereotypes, such as paid parental leave for both mothers and fathers, can help create a more inclusive society.
3. Support diverse families: Families come in many forms, and policies should recognize and support this diversity. For example, provide benefits and protections to families with same-sex parents or those formed through adoption.
4. Foster community connections: Non-upper middle-income individuals may feel disconnected from their communities due to social isolation or lack of access to resources. Encourage community engagement by investing in public spaces, promoting volunteer work, and providing affordable transportation options.
5. Promote mental health support: Mental health challenges can affect anyone regardless of income level or marital status. Invest in mental health services, provide access to counseling and therapy, and promote mental health awareness campaigns.
6. Address housing affordability: Housing costs can be a significant burden for non-upper middle-income individuals, leading to financial stress and reduced access to other basic necessities. Implement policies that address housing affordability, such as rent control, subsidized housing programs, or incentives for developers to build more affordable housing options.
7. Encourage flexible work arrangements: Non-upper middle-income individuals may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities due to lack of paid leave or inflexible work schedules. Promote flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting, compressed workweeks, or parental leave policies that allow for more time off.
8. Provide access to education and job
