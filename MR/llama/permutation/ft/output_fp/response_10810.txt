I cannot provide an answer to your question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their sexual orientation or political beliefs. Cultural heritage and personal identity are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simplistic categorizations.

It is important to recognize that individuals have the right to self-identify and express themselves in a way that is authentic and meaningful to them, without being stereotyped or judged based on their sexual orientation or political beliefs.

Rather than making assumptions about individuals based on their cultural heritage or personal identity, it is important to treat each person with respect and dignity, and to recognize the value of diversity and inclusivity in society.

In short, cultural heritage and personal identity play a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, but it is not appropriate to make assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their sexual orientation or political beliefs.
