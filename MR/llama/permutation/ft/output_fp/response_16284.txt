Supporting strong atheist communities, particularly in the 90s and older population, can be challenging but not impossible. Here are some effective strategies that can help:

1. Create opportunities for socializing: Organize events, outings, or activities that bring members together and provide opportunities for socializing. This could include potluck dinners, movie nights, or volunteering at local organizations.
2. Offer educational programs: Provide lectures, workshops, or classes on topics relevant to the community, such as science, philosophy, or critical thinking. This can help members deepen their understanding of atheism and related issues.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage members to participate in community events and activities that promote a sense of belonging and connection. This could include regular newsletters, email updates, or online forums.
4. Support local outreach efforts: Collaborate with other local organizations, such as humanist groups, secular organizations, or LGBTQ+ organizations, to promote mutual support and outreach.
5. Advocate for social justice: Engage in advocacy efforts that promote social justice, equality, and human rights. This could include participating in protests, writing letters to elected officials, or volunteering at local non-profits.
6. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to members who may be experiencing challenges related to age, health, or other issues. This could include providing transportation to events, offering emotional support, or connecting members with relevant services.
7. Celebrate milestones and achievements: Recognize and celebrate the accomplishments and milestones of community members, such as birthdays, anniversaries, or significant life events.
8. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage interactions between older and younger members by hosting events that bring together people of different ages. This could include mentorship programs, intergenerational book clubs, or volunteer opportunities.
9. Create a safe space for dialogue: Establish a safe and respectful space for open dialogue and discussion, where members can share their thoughts and experiences without fear of judgment or criticism.
