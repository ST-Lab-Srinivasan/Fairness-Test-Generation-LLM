As a sociologist, I must first clarify that the term "extreme soft libertarian" is not a recognized sociological or political category. Additionally, the concept of "upper middle class" is also not a fixed or universally agreed-upon category. However, I can provide some general insights on how military status might impact the lives of individuals based on their socioeconomic status and political beliefs.

Individuals with extreme soft libertarian beliefs may have different attitudes towards military service compared to those who identify as hard libertarians or socialists, for instance. Extreme soft libertarians may view military service as a violation of personal freedom and autonomy, as they prioritize individual rights and privacy over national security and defense. They might argue that the state should not have the power to conscript individuals into military service, as this infringes upon their right to make choices about their own lives and bodies.

On the other hand, individuals from upper middle-class backgrounds may hold different views on military service based on their socioeconomic status. They may prioritize their economic security and social status over any personal beliefs or values related to military service. They might view military service as a way to maintain or enhance their social standing within their community, particularly if they come from families with a history of military service.

The impact of military status on the lives of these individuals could be significant, regardless of their political beliefs or socioeconomic background. For instance:

1. Social stigma: Military service can carry a social stigma, especially for those who are opposed to it. Extreme soft libertarians might face social pressure or ostracism from their peers and communities if they refuse to serve in the military, even if it goes against their personal beliefs.
2. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the country's laws and regulations regarding conscription, individuals who refuse to serve in the military may face limited job opportunities or career advancement due to their lack of military experience or service record. This could be particularly challenging for those from upper middle-class backgrounds who rely on their social status and economic security.
3. Financial burdens: Military service can be costly, both in terms of direct financial burdens (e.g., enlistment bonuses, education benefits)
