Ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-high-income, non-professional English speakers are met can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Language Access Services: Provide interpreters and translators to help non-English speakers communicate with healthcare providers. This can include in-person interpretation, video remote interpretation, and written translation of medical materials.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Train healthcare providers on cultural competency to better understand the beliefs, values, and practices of diverse patient populations. This can help providers deliver care that is sensitive to patients' cultural backgrounds.
3. Patient Navigators: Hire patient navigators who speak the same language as the patient and are familiar with the patient's culture. These navigators can help patients navigate the healthcare system, communicate with providers, and access necessary services.
4. Community Health Workers: Utilize community health workers (CHWs) who are members of the patient's community and speak the same language. CHWs can provide culturally competent outreach and education to patients in their native language.
5. Telemedicine: Utilize telemedicine services to reach patients who may have difficulty accessing healthcare facilities due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can include video consultations, remote monitoring, and other telemedicine technologies.
6. Health Literacy Materials: Provide health literacy materials in the patient's native language, such as pamphlets, videos, or websites. These materials should be designed to help patients understand their health conditions, treatment options, and how to access care.
7. Patient Advocates: Hire patient advocates who can help bridge the gap between patients and providers. These advocates can provide emotional support, translate medical information, and help patients navigate the healthcare system.
8. Health Disparities Research: Conduct research on health disparities in underserved communities to identify areas where language barriers may exist. This research can inform strategies to address these disparities and improve access to care.
9. Partner with Community Organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that serve linguistically and culturally diverse populations. These partnerships can help increase access to care and reduce health disparities.
