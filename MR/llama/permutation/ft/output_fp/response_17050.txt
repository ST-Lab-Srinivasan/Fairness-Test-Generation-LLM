The impact of marital status on the lives of formerly long-time married progressive individuals can vary widely depending on their individual experiences, beliefs, and values. However, some common themes and challenges that may arise for these individuals include:

1. Identity crisis: After a long-term marriage ends, it can be difficult for progressive individuals to redefine their identity and sense of self. They may feel a loss of purpose or meaning in life, particularly if their marital status was closely tied to their sense of self.
2. Social isolation: Progressive individuals who were married for many years may find themselves feeling isolated or disconnected from their social networks after the marriage ends. This can be especially challenging if they relied heavily on their spouse for social support and connection.
3. Emotional upheaval: The emotional impact of a long-term marriage ending can be significant, particularly if the couple had a close and loving relationship. Progressive individuals may experience a range of emotions, including grief, sadness, anger, and confusion.
4. Financial uncertainty: After a long-term marriage, progressive individuals may face financial instability or insecurity, particularly if they relied on their spouse for financial support. This can be stressful and challenging, particularly if they are not prepared to manage their finances independently.
5. Loss of shared values: Progressive individuals who were married for many years may feel a loss of shared values and beliefs with their ex-partner. This can make it difficult to navigate the breakup process and move forward in a positive direction.
6. Stigma and judgment: Unfortunately, there may be societal stigma or judgment attached to being a progressive individual who has been through a divorce. Progressive individuals may face discrimination or criticism from friends, family, or colleagues, which can be emotionally challenging and isolating.
7. Difficulty adjusting to new relationships: For some progressive individuals, it may be challenging to navigate new romantic relationships after a long-term marriage ends. They may struggle with trust issues, communication problems, or unrealistic expectations about what a new relationship should look like.
8. Balancing work and personal life: Progressive individuals who were married for many years may find it challenging to balance their work and personal lives
