Disability can have significant impacts on the lives of permanent residents who are not recently single. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face barriers in social interactions and relationships, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Disabilities can make it difficult for individuals to attend school or work, leading to limited career opportunities and financial stability.
3. Discrimination and stigma: People with disabilities may experience discrimination and stigma from their peers, which can lead to lower self-esteem and mental health issues.
4. Lack of accessibility: Inaccessible buildings, transportation, and facilities can limit the opportunities for people with disabilities to participate in society, leading to feelings of frustration and helplessness.
5. Health problems: Disabilities can lead to a range of physical and mental health issues, such as chronic pain, sleep disturbances, and anxiety disorders.
6. Dependence on caregivers: Many people with disabilities may require constant care and support from family members or caregivers, leading to feelings of dependence and loss of autonomy.
7. Limited participation in civic life: Disabilities can limit an individual's ability to participate fully in civic life, including voting, volunteering, and engaging in community activities.
8. Financial hardship: People with disabilities may face significant financial challenges due to higher healthcare costs, reduced earning potential, and increased reliance on government support.
9. Limited access to technology: Individuals with disabilities may have limited access to assistive technologies, such as wheelchairs, prosthetics, and communication devices, which can limit their ability to participate in society.
10. Lack of representation and advocacy: People with disabilities may have limited voice and representation in political and social discourse, leading to a lack of understanding and support for their needs and rights.

It's important to recognize that these impacts can vary greatly depending on the individual, their type of disability, and the societal and cultural context in which they live. However, by acknowledging these potential effects, we can work towards creating more inclusive environments that promote equality, accessibility, and social justice
