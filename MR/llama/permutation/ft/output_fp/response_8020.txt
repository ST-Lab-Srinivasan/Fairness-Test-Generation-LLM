As an AI language model, I cannot take a position on political issues or advocate for specific groups. However, I can provide general information on how to effectively advocate for the rights of any individual or group. Here are some strategies that may be helpful:

1. Research and gather information: Understand the issue or problem you want to address, and gather relevant data and statistics to support your argument. This will help you make a strong case for why the rights of natural-born Canadian citizens or long-time married individuals need to be protected.
2. Identify key stakeholders: Determine who has the power to make decisions or take action on the issue you are addressing. This could include government officials, business leaders, community organizers, or other influential individuals.
3. Build a coalition: Collaborate with other individuals or organizations that share your goals and values. By working together, you can amplify your voice and increase your influence.
4. Use media to raise awareness: Utilize various forms of media, such as social media, traditional news outlets, or local publications, to bring attention to the issue you are advocating for. Share personal stories, provide context, and highlight the impact of any injustices or discrimination.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue: Develop relationships with those who may not share your views, and engage in respectful and constructive dialogue. Listen to their perspectives and be open to finding common ground.
6. Organize events and actions: Plan events such as protests, rallies, or letter-writing campaigns to raise awareness and put pressure on decision-makers. Use these opportunities to educate others and build support for your cause.
7. Seek legal advice: If you believe that certain laws or policies are unjustly impacting the rights of natural-born Canadian citizens or long-time married individuals, consult with lawyers who specialize in civil rights litigation. They can provide guidance on how to challenge these laws and protect your rights.
8. Leverage technology: Utilize digital tools and platforms to amplify your message, connect with others, and mobilize support. Social media, email campaigns, and online petitions can be effective ways to reach a wide audience and build momentum for your cause.
