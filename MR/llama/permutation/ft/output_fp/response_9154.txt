As a language model, I can provide some potential challenges that beginner English speakers who are long-time married people may face in the job market:

1. Language barriers: For those who are non-native English speakers or have limited proficiency in the language, communication and expression of ideas can be a challenge. This can make it difficult to convey their thoughts and ideas effectively in a professional setting.
2. Cultural differences: As married people, they may have developed cultural norms and values that differ from those of their colleagues and employers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications in the workplace.
3. Lack of tech-savviness: Many older workers may not be as familiar with technology as younger generations, which can be a disadvantage in the modern job market. They may struggle to adapt to new software, tools, and systems that are used in the workplace.
4. Limited education or training: Some long-time married people may have taken a break from their careers to raise a family, which can result in a lack of formal education or training in their desired field. This can make it difficult to compete with younger, more educated job seekers.
5. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is still prevalent in many workplaces, and older workers may face discrimination or bias due to their age. This can limit their opportunities for advancement or promotion.
6. Networking challenges: As married people, they may have limited opportunities to network and build professional connections outside of their immediate social circle. This can make it difficult to learn about job opportunities or get recommendations from colleagues or peers.
7. Work-life balance: Many long-time married people may prioritize their family obligations over their career, which can make it challenging to manage the demands of a full-time job while also fulfilling family responsibilities.
8. Limited flexibility: As older workers, they may have more commitments and responsibilities outside of work, such as family or personal obligations. This can limit their ability to be flexible with their schedule or adapt to changing work arrangements.
9. Stereotyping: Unfortunately, there are many stereotypes and misconceptions about older workers, which can lead to discrimination or bias
