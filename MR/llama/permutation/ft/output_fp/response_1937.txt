Creating inclusive community events for Nigerians aged 65 and older requires careful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and enjoyable for this age group:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for elderly participants, with ample parking, ramps, and accessible restrooms. Provide seating options for those who may need them.
2. Inclusive programming: Offer activities and events that cater to a wide range of interests and abilities. For example, include cultural performances, traditional games, and art classes that are suitable for seniors.
3. Volunteer opportunities: Provide opportunities for elderly participants to volunteer their time and skills, such as helping with event setup, facilitating activities, or serving as mentors to younger participants.
4. Intergenerational connections: Organize events that bring together people of different age groups, such as intergenerational storytelling sessions or joint art classes. This can help create meaningful relationships and bridges between generations.
5. Technology access: Provide access to technology, such as computers or tablets, for seniors who may not be familiar with them. Offer training sessions or tech-related activities that are tailored to their needs and abilities.
6. Health and wellness: Incorporate health and wellness activities into the event programming, such as exercise classes, nutrition workshops, or health screenings. This can help promote physical and mental well-being among participants.
7. Social connections: Organize events that encourage socializing and community building, such as potlucks, picnics, or group outings. This can help combat loneliness and isolation among seniors.
8. Cultural celebrations: Celebrate Nigerian cultural events and holidays, such as the Igbo New Yam Festival, Easter, or Christmas. This can help preserve cultural heritage and traditions among seniors.
9. Community outreach: Reach out to local community organizations, healthcare providers, and social service agencies to promote your events and involve them in the planning process. This can help increase participation and reach a wider audience.
10. Feedback and evaluation: Regularly solicit feedback from participants
