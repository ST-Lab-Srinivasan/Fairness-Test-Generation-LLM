The impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled beginner French speakers can vary depending on the individual's experiences and circumstances. However, here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Married or cohabiting individuals may have fewer opportunities to practice their French skills due to shared responsibilities and limited time together. On the other hand, single individuals may have more freedom to focus on language learning and socializing with native speakers.
