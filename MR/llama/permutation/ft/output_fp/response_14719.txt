Supporting the social inclusion of natural-born US citizens who are recently undocumented involves addressing the systemic barriers and discrimination they face. Here are some ways to promote their social inclusion:

1. Advocate for comprehensive immigration reform: Support legislation that provides a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including those who were born in the US. This can help reduce the fear of deportation and increase their access to basic rights and services.
2. Educate the public about the contributions of immigrants: Highlight the economic, social, and cultural benefits that immigrants bring to the US. Use data and stories to demonstrate the importance of immigrant communities and challenge negative stereotypes.
3. Promote diversity and inclusion in education: Ensure that schools are welcoming and inclusive for all students, regardless of their immigration status. Provide resources and support for English language learners and other vulnerable populations.
