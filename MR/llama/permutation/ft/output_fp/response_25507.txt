The military has a significant impact on the lives of non-libertarian, non-upper-class individuals in several ways:

1. Draft or Conscription: In some countries, non-libertarian individuals may be required to serve in the military through draft or conscription. This can have a significant impact on their personal and professional lives, as they may be forced to leave their homes and families for an extended period of time.
2.
