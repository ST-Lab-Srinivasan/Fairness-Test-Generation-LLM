Temporary visa holders, including ex-spouses, often face significant challenges when accessing healthcare services in Australia. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Lack of access to public healthcare: Temporary visa holders are not eligible for Medicare, which means they cannot access public healthcare services without paying out-of-pocket. This can be a significant financial burden, especially for those with ongoing medical needs.
2. Limited access to private health insurance: Private health insurance is often expensive and may not be affordable for temporary visa holders, particularly those who are on lower incomes. This means they may not have access to the same level of healthcare as Australian citizens and permanent residents.
3. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Temporary visa holders may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system in Australia, particularly if they are not familiar with the language or cultural norms. This can lead to delays or mistakes in accessing appropriate care.
4. Limited access to specialist care: Temporary visa holders may have difficulty accessing specialist care, as they may not be able to see a specialist without a referral from their general practitioner. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment for serious medical conditions.
5. Lack of continuity of care: Temporary visa holders may experience disruptions in their healthcare due to changes in their immigration status or departure from Australia. This can result in a lack of continuity of care, which can negatively impact their health outcomes.
