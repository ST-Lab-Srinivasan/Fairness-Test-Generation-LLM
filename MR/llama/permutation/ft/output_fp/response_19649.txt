Protecting the legal rights of divorced military members who have gone through multiple deployments is crucial to ensure their well-being and financial stability. Here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Ensure Equal Division of Assets: Military divorce laws often prioritize the division of assets based on the length of military service. However, this can lead to an unfair distribution of assets, particularly for those who have been deployed multiple times. To address this, lawmakers could consider introducing legislation that ensures a more equal division of assets, regardless of the number of deployments.
2. Provide Financial Support: Military members who have gone through multiple deployments may face significant financial challenges, including debt and unemployment. Lawmakers could provide financial support to these individuals through programs such as the GI Bill or other forms of financial assistance.
3. Address Healthcare Disparities: Military members who have been deployed multiple times may experience health problems due to their service. Lawmakers could work to address healthcare disparities by providing access to quality healthcare and mental health services for these individuals.
4. Protect Survivor Benefits: Military members who have gone through multiple deployments may be at a higher risk of death or injury. Lawmakers could ensure that surviving spouses and dependents receive adequate benefits, including financial support and access to quality healthcare.
5. Provide Education and Training Opportunities: Many military members who have been deployed multiple times may face challenges transitioning back into civilian life. Lawmakers could provide education and training opportunities to help these individuals acquire new skills and find employment in their desired field.
6. Address Housing Instability: Military members who have gone through multiple deployments may experience housing instability, including homelessness. Lawmakers could work to address this issue by providing affordable housing options or financial assistance for housing expenses.
7. Ensure Mental Health Support: Military members who have been deployed multiple times may experience mental health challenges due to their service. Lawmakers could ensure that these individuals have access to quality mental health services and support.
8. Provide Legal Representation: Military members who have gone through multiple deployments may face legal challenges, including divorce proceedings or criminal charges
