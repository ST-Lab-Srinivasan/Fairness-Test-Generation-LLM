Promoting the educational success of Native American natural-born US citizens requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural relevance: Incorporate traditional Native American teachings, values, and practices into the curriculum to make it more culturally relevant and meaningful for students. This can include incorporating traditional stories, languages, and cultural practices into the classroom.
2. Indigenous-centered education: Develop an education system that is grounded in Indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing. This can involve incorporating Indigenous perspectives, methods, and epistemologies into the curriculum and teaching practices.
3. Identity-based learning: Create learning environments that affirm and value Native American identities and cultures. This can involve incorporating cultural activities, rituals, and ceremonies into the curriculum and creating spaces for students to share their cultural knowledge and experiences.
4. Community involvement: Involve local Native American communities in the educational process through partnerships, collaborations, and consultation. This can help ensure that the education system is responsive to the needs and priorities of the community.
5. Teacher training: Provide teacher training and professional development opportunities that focus on culturally responsive teaching practices and pedagogies. This can help teachers better understand and address the unique needs and challenges faced by Native American students.
6. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers to educational success, such as inadequate funding, lack of resources, and discrimination. This can involve advocating for policy changes and resource allocation that prioritize the needs of Native American students.
7. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship and support opportunities for Native American students, including peer mentoring, academic advising, and career guidance. This can help students navigate the educational system and achieve their academic goals.
8. Language revitalization: Support language revitalization efforts in Native American communities by incorporating traditional languages into the curriculum and providing language immersion programs.
