Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-citizen, non-conservative individuals requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Diversify the programming: Offer a variety of activities and performances that reflect the diverse backgrounds and experiences of your attendees. This can include music, dance, art, food, and other cultural expressions from around the world.
2. Provide translation services: Offer translation services in multiple languages to ensure that everyone can understand and participate in the event. This can include live interpretation, printed materials in different languages, or video translations.
3. Accessibility features: Make sure that the venue is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
4. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language in your marketing materials and promote the event through multiple channels to reach a diverse audience.
5. Interactive activities: Plan interactive activities that allow attendees to engage with each other and learn about different cultures. This can include cultural workshops, panel discussions, and group activities.
6. Safe space policy: Establish a safe space policy for the event to ensure that all attendees feel comfortable and included. This can include providing gender-neutral bathrooms and having a clear policy on harassment and discrimination.
7. Collaborate with diverse organizations: Partner with organizations that represent diverse communities to help promote the event and ensure that it is inclusive of all attendees.
8. Flexible pricing options: Offer flexible pricing options to accommodate different financial situations, such as sliding scale pricing or pay-what-you-can options.
9. Access to childcare: Provide access to childcare services during the event to ensure that families can participate together.
10. Post-event follow-up: Follow up with attendees after the event to gather feedback and make improvements for future events.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a more inclusive cultural event that welcomes and includes non-citizen, non-conservative individuals.
