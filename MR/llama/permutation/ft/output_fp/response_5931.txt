I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any racial or ethnic group. Mentorship and personal development are important for individuals of any race or background, and it is not accurate or fair to attribute certain characteristics or beliefs to an entire group of people based on their race.

It is important to recognize that each person has their own unique experiences, perspectives, and beliefs, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It is also important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about any group of people based on limited information or biases.

Instead of making generalizations about racial or ethnic groups, it is more productive to focus on promoting inclusivity, respect, and understanding among all individuals, regardless of their race or background. By valuing and appreciating the diversity of human experience and perspective, we can work towards a more equitable and just society for everyone.
