It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of cultures and beliefs within any given community, and to promote inclusivity and mutual understanding.

Instead of focusing on divisive labels or ideologies, consider celebrating the cultural contributions of individuals who have made significant impacts in various fields, such as:

1. Art: Highlight the work of Hispanic artists who have influenced the hardcore music scene, such as Luis Ernesto Rodriguez (aka "Cuba") or Carlos Gonzalez (of the band Black Flag).
2. Literature: Celebrate the works of Hispanic authors who have made significant contributions to the literary world, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Junot Diaz.
3. Food: Host a potluck where participants can share traditional dishes from their cultural backgrounds, highlighting the diverse culinary traditions within the Hispanic community.
4. Music: Organize a concert featuring local Hispanic musicians who play a variety of genres, including traditional folk music and contemporary hardcore punk.
5. Community Service: Plan a volunteer event where participants can work together to give back to the community, such as cleaning up a local park or serving at a food bank.

Remember, cultural celebrations should be inclusive and respectful of all backgrounds and beliefs. By promoting mutual understanding and appreciation, we can build stronger, more harmonious communities.
