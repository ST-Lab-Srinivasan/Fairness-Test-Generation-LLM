Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Divorced Multiple Times Native French Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who have gone through multiple divorces. For recently divorced native French speakers, cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and continuity, even in the aftermath of a failed marriage. This study aims to explore the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of recently divorced multiple times native French speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can influence an individual's sense of identity and belonging (Hall, 1976; Giddens, 1991). For example, individuals who identify strongly with their cultural heritage are more likely to feel a sense of belonging to their community and to experience a greater sense of self-esteem (Hong, 2015). Additionally, cultural heritage can provide a sense of stability and continuity in times of change or uncertainty (Komita, 2009).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from a purposive sample of 15 recently divorced multiple times native French speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and will be interviewed in their preferred language (French or English). The interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
The findings of this study reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently divorced multiple times native French speaker individuals. Participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural heritage, which provided a sense of belonging and continuity in times of change and uncertainty. Additionally, participants believed that their cultural heritage influenced their values, beliefs, and practices, particularly in relation to marriage and family.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the importance of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently divorced multiple times native French speaker individuals. The findings suggest that cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and continuity, even in the aftermath of a failed marriage. Therefore
