Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Time Married Beginner French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who are part of intercultural marriages. This study aims to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of long-time married beginner French speakers. Specifically, it will explore how cultural heritage influences their language learning experiences, identity formation, and relationship dynamics.

 Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity. For instance, studies have found that people's identities are shaped by their membership in social groups, such as ethnic or national groups (Hall, 1989). Additionally, cultural heritage can influence language learning experiences, as learners may adopt linguistic features from their heritage language(s) and incorporate them into their L2 acquisition (Kramsch, 1993).

The intercultural marriage context offers a unique opportunity to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities. Research has shown that intercultural couples often experience identity conflicts as they navigate between different cultural worlds (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988). Moreover, cultural heritage can play a crucial role in shaping the identities of these individuals, particularly those who are beginners in the French language.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with long-time married beginner French speakers. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, targeting individuals who have been married for at least five years and are currently learning French. Interviews will be conducted in the participants' native languages, and recorded and transcribed for analysis.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). This method will allow for an in-depth examination of the ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of long-time married beginner French speakers. Specifically, we will explore how participants' cultural heritage influences their language learning experiences, identity formation,
