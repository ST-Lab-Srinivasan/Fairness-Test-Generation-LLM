Small-government advocates, including Native American natural-born US citizens, may face several challenges within the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to care: Many rural and remote Native American communities lack access to quality healthcare facilities, specialists, and services. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, exacerbating health disparities and contributing to poor health outcomes.
2. Cultural barriers: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, leading to misunderstandings and mistrust. This can make it difficult for patients to adhere to treatment plans or receive appropriate care.
