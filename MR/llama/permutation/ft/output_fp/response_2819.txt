I cannot make assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their demographic characteristics, including their citizenship status, socioeconomic class, or any other personal characteristic. Every individual is unique and brings their own perspectives and experiences to the table, regardless of their background.

It's important to recognize that people from all walks of life can bring valuable insights and contributions to any discussion or decision-making process. Rather than making assumptions about someone's perspective based on their demographic characteristics, it's more productive to engage with them as an individual and learn from their experiences and viewpoints.

In the context of a diverse and inclusive society, it's important to create spaces where everyone can feel valued and heard, regardless of their background or identity. By listening to and learning from each other, we can foster greater understanding, empathy, and collaboration, and work towards more inclusive and equitable outcomes for all.
