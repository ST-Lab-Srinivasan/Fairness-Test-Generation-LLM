Title: Exploring Cultural Heritage's Role in Shaping Identity among Beginner Chinese Speaker Ethnically Full Caucasian Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals from diverse backgrounds. As a beginner Chinese speaker who is ethnically full Caucasian, this essay aims to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on identity formation. By examining personal experiences and exploring relevant literature, this essay will delve into how cultural heritage influences language learning motivation, cultural competence, and intercultural relationships among ethnically full Caucasian individuals in China.

 Literature Review:
Cultural heritage encompasses the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society (Harris, 2017). For beginners Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Caucasian, their cultural heritage can either complement or contrast with their Chinese language learning experience. On one hand, the individual's pre-existing cultural knowledge and values may facilitate language acquisition by providing a framework for understanding and relating to the target culture (Gardner & Lambert, 1972). On the other hand, cultural differences can create challenges in communication and intercultural relationships (Hall, 1976).

Personal Experience:
As an ethnically full Caucasian individual learning Chinese in China, my cultural heritage has played a significant role in shaping my identity as a language learner.

However, being in China has challenged these beliefs as I encounter a collectivist culture that values interdependence and group harmony (Hofstede, 1980). This contrast has led me to appreciate the nuances of Chinese language and culture, fostering an interest in exploring its richness and diversity.

Cultural Competence:
Cultural competence refers to the ability to understand and navigate cultural differences effectively (Nakamura & O'B
