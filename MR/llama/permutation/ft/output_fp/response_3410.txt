Feminine nominal Muslim individuals, who are Muslims but do not necessarily conform to traditional gender roles or expectations, may face unique challenges in disaster response situations. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Inclusive planning and response: Ensure that all individuals, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, are included in disaster planning and response efforts. This can be achieved by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences during the planning stage and incorporating them into the response plan.
2. Providing safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for feminine nominal Muslim individuals to express their needs and concerns. This can involve setting up gender-neutral facilities, such as restrooms or prayer areas, that are accessible to all individuals regardless of gender identity.
3. Respecting cultural practices: Recognize and respect the cultural practices and beliefs of feminine nominal Muslim individuals, particularly those related to gender and religion. This can involve being sensitive to their dress code requirements, dietary restrictions, or other cultural practices that may impact their well-being during a disaster response.
4. Addressing gender-based violence: Provide support and resources for feminine nominal Muslim individuals who may be at risk of gender-based violence during a disaster response. This can involve implementing policies and procedures to prevent sexual harassment and assault, as well as providing safe spaces for individuals to seek refuge if needed.
5. Promoting gender equality: Work towards promoting gender equality in disaster response efforts by actively addressing any gender-based disparities or biases that may exist. This can involve providing equal opportunities for leadership roles, ensuring fair distribution of resources, and promoting inclusive decision-making processes.
6. Providing mental health support: Offer mental health support services to feminine nominal Muslim individuals who may be experiencing trauma or stress related to the disaster response. This can involve providing access to gender-sensitive counseling services, as well as creating safe spaces for individuals to express their feelings and concerns.
7. Addressing language barriers: Provide translation services or interpretive assistance to ensure that feminine nominal Muslim individuals have equal access to information and resources during the disaster response. This can involve hiring interpreters who are fluent in the relevant languages spoken by the affected community, as well
