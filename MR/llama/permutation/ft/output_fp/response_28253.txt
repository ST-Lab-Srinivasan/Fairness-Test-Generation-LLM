Native American communities have historically faced significant barriers to economic prosperity, including systemic racism, discrimination, and lack of access to resources and opportunities. Supporting the economic empowerment of Native natural-born US citizen unemployed individuals requires addressing these structural issues and providing targeted support. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Job training and placement programs: Provide job training and placement services tailored to the needs of Native American communities. These programs should focus on in-demand industries, such as healthcare, technology, and renewable energy, and offer hands-on training and mentorship opportunities.
2. Entrepreneurship support: Encourage entrepreneurship by providing access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities. This can involve creating incubators or accelerators specifically for Native American-owned businesses, as well as offering training on business planning, financial management, and marketing.
3. Apprenticeship programs: Develop apprenticeship programs that allow individuals to learn a trade or skill while working under the supervision of experienced professionals. This can help build a skilled workforce and provide a pathway to well-paying jobs in industries such as construction, manufacturing, and energy.
4. Education and vocational training: Offer educational programs that provide vocational training and certifications in high-demand fields, such as healthcare, IT, and advanced manufacturing. This can help individuals gain the skills they need to compete in the job market and access better-paying jobs.
5. Mentorship and networking opportunities: Connect unemployed Native Americans with successful professionals and business leaders who can provide mentorship, advice, and networking opportunities. This can help individuals build valuable connections and gain insights into potential career paths.
6. Addressing systemic barriers: Advocate for policies that address systemic barriers to economic prosperity in Native American communities, such as discrimination, lack of access to capital, and inadequate infrastructure. This can involve working with government agencies, businesses, and other stakeholders to address these issues and create a more level playing field for economic development.
