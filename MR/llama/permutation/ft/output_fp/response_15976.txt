To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Chinese speakers who have been unable to study the language for a long time are met, there are several strategies that can be employed:

1. Adaptive Learning: Use adaptive learning techniques that adjust the difficulty level of the course content based on the student's progress and performance. This will help the students learn at their own pace and feel more comfortable with the material.
2. Personalized Learning: Offer personalized learning experiences tailored to each student's needs, interests, and learning style. This can be achieved through the use of AI-powered language learning tools that provide customized feedback and guidance.
3. Interactive Content: Incorporate interactive content such as quizzes, games, and multimedia activities that cater to different learning styles and keep the students engaged.

9. Feedback and Assessment: Provide regular feedback and assessment to help students track their progress and identify areas for improvement. This can include quizzes, exams, and other evaluation methods that are tailored to the student's
