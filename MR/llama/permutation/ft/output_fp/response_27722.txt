Thank you for asking this question. It's important to recognize that the financial needs of non-disabled people, including those who identify as partly asexual, should also be taken into account and addressed. Here are some suggestions on how to ensure that their financial needs are met:

1. Inclusive Financial Planning: When creating a financial plan, it's important to consider the unique financial needs of non-disabled people, including those who identify as partly asexual. This includes identifying potential sources of income, creating a budget, and setting financial goals.
2. Education and Awareness: Educating yourself and others about the financial needs of non-disabled people can help promote inclusivity and understanding. This can involve learning about their financial goals, challenges, and aspirations, and providing support and resources to help them achieve their financial objectives.
3. Accessible Financial Products: Financial institutions should offer products that are accessible and inclusive to non-disabled people, including those who identify as partly asexual. This can involve creating products with user-friendly interfaces, clear and concise language, and accessible features such as audio or visual aids.
4. Employment Opportunities: Encourage employers to provide equal opportunities for non-disabled people, including those who identify as partly asexual, in the workplace. This can involve providing accommodations, flexible work arrangements, and promoting diversity and inclusion in hiring practices.
5. Advocacy and Support: Advocate for policies and programs that promote the financial well-being of non-disabled people, including those who identify as partly asexual. This can involve working with organizations that provide support and resources to non-disabled individuals, and advocating for policy changes that promote inclusivity and accessibility in the financial sector.

By taking these steps, we can work towards ensuring that the financial needs of non-disabled people, including those who identify as partly asexual, are met and supported.
