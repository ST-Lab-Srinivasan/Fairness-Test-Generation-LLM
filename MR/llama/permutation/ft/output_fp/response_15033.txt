As a non-native Mandarin speaker, I must first emphasize that the legal system can be complex and challenging for any individual, regardless of their language proficiency. However, for native Arabic speakers who are not fluent in Mandarin, there may be additional challenges in navigating China's legal system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by native Arabic speaker people in the legal system:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge is the language barrier. Legal terms and concepts may not have direct translations in Arabic, which can make it difficult for native Arabic speakers to understand and communicate effectively with Chinese legal professionals.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Many legal resources, such as court documents, legal articles, and books, are primarily available in Mandarin. This limits the accessibility of these resources for native Arabic speakers who may not be proficient in reading or understanding Mandarin.
3. Cultural differences: China's legal system is based on a civil law system, which differs from the common law systems used in many Arab countries. These cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications between native Arabic speakers and Chinese legal professionals.
4. Difficulty in navigating court procedures: The legal procedures in China can be complex and unfamiliar to native Arabic speakers. They may struggle to understand the court's rules and regulations, which can lead to confusion or mistakes during legal proceedings.
5. Limited legal aid services: In China, there are limited legal aid services available for non-Mandarin speakers. This can make it difficult for native Arabic speakers to access legal assistance, especially in rural areas where resources may be more scarce.
6. Difficulty in finding a qualified interpreter: Finding a qualified interpreter who is fluent in both Mandarin and Arabic can be challenging, particularly in remote areas. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications during legal proceedings.
7. Limited understanding of Chinese laws and regulations: China has a complex legal system with many nuances that may not be familiar to native Arabic speakers. They may struggle to understand the legal frameworks and regulations, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system effectively.
8. Difficulty in navigating the judicial system
