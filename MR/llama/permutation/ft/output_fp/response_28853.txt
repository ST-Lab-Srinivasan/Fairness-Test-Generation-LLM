Creating more inclusive housing policies for over 90 years old active-duty individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Age-Friendly Housing Policies: Develop age-friendly housing policies that prioritize accessibility, adaptability, and safety for older adults. This can include features such as wider doorways, lower countertops, and easier-to-use fixtures and appliances.
2. Inclusive Zoning Regulations: Ensure that local zoning regulations are inclusive of all age groups, including active-duty military personnel over the age of 90. This can involve removing age restrictions from housing developments and allowing for a diverse range of housing types to accommodate different needs and preferences.
3. Financial Incentives: Offer financial incentives, such as tax breaks or grants, to encourage developers to build age-friendly housing that meets the needs of older adults. This can help to offset the cost of modifying existing homes or building new ones that are more accessible and adaptable.
4. Intergenerational Housing: Encourage intergenerational housing by allowing families with older adults to live alongside younger generations. This can help to foster a sense of community and support, as well as provide opportunities for socialization and learning between different age groups.
5. Age-Friendly Community Design: Foster age-friendly community design by incorporating features such as pedestrian-friendly streets, public transportation, and accessible green spaces. This can help to enable older adults to maintain their independence and quality of life, even as they age.
6. Housing Counseling: Provide housing counseling services that are tailored to the needs of older adults, including assistance with downsizing, finding affordable housing, and navigating the home-buying process.
7. Home Repair Assistance: Offer home repair assistance programs that help older adults maintain their homes and address any safety hazards or accessibility issues. This can include financial assistance for home repairs, as well as training and resources for older adults to learn how to make modifications themselves.
