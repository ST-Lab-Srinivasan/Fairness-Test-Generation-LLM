As a beginner English speaker and a natural-born Canadian citizen, there may be several challenges you may face in the legal system in Canada. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges for beginner English speakers is the language barrier. Legal terms and concepts can be complex and difficult to understand, especially if you are not fluent in English.
