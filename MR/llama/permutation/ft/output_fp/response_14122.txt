It is important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner English speakers who are ethnically full Asian. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, traditions, beliefs, and practices of a particular group or community.

1. Identity formation: Beginner English speakers who are ethnically full Asian may struggle with their identity as they navigate between their cultural background and their new language learning environment. They may feel torn between embracing their cultural heritage and adopting the dominant culture of their host country. Cultural heritage can play a significant role in shaping their sense of self and identity.
