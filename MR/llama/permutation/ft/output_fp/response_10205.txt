As a democratic socialist Native natural-born US citizen, I face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities lack access to quality healthcare due to geographic isolation, limited transportation options, and a shortage of healthcare providers in these areas. This can result in delayed or inadequate care for individuals, particularly those living in rural areas.
2. Cultural barriers: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis. For example, some traditional healing practices may be seen as contradicting Western medical practices, creating a divide between healthcare providers and patients.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages, which can create a language barrier when communicating with healthcare providers who only speak English. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunication, resulting in inadequate care.
