Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for native French speakers who identify as partially asexual requires understanding and acknowledging the experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive events:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual spectrum, including grey-asexuality, demisexuality, and other identities. Understand that asexuality exists and is valid, just like any other sexual orientation.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in your event promotions, programs, and announcements. Avoid assuming everyone is straight or cisgender (not transgender). Instead, use gender-neutral language or ask people to identify their preferred pronouns.
3. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure your event space is accessible and comfortable for all attendees, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Provide gender-neutral restrooms or have a variety of options available.
4. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume everyone is straight or cisgender. Instead, ask people about their identity and preferences. For example, you could include a question in your registration form like "What pronouns do you prefer?" or "Are you straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc.?"
5. Involve the community: Reach out to local asexual organizations or communities for input and participation. They can provide valuable insights and help create an inclusive environment.
6. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for attendees who may need them, such as quiet spaces for those with sensory overload or gender-neutral options for those who don't identify with traditional gender categories.
7. Celebrate diversity: Highlight the diversity of sexual orientations and genders in your event promotions and programming. Showcase asexuality as a valid and important part of the LGBTQ+ community.
8. Be mindful of representation: Ensure that your event includes representation from various identities, including asexual individuals. Provide opportunities for asexual voices to be heard and for their experiences to be acknowledged.
9. Foster inclusive dialogue: Encourage open and respectful dialogue among attendees about sexuality and gender
