As a language learner and PhD holder, I understand the challenges of learning a new language, especially after a significant life event like a divorce. Here are some tailored suggestions to address the specific needs of recently divorced beginner French speakers:

1. Offer empathy and support: Beginner French learners who have gone through a divorce may be experiencing emotional challenges, including anxiety, depression, or stress. Be sensitive to these challenges and offer support and encouragement throughout the learning process.
2. Focus on practical language skills: Divorced individuals may need to navigate everyday situations like shopping, banking, and communicating with their ex-partner. Teach practical language skills that can help them handle these situations confidently.
3. Use relatable content: Incorporate content that is relevant to the learners' experiences, such as discussions on divorce, single life, or cultural differences. This can help them feel more engaged and motivated in their language learning journey.
4. Provide flexible scheduling options: Divorced individuals may have different schedules due to childcare responsibilities, work commitments, or personal obligations. Offer flexible scheduling options, such as online courses or one-on-one tutoring sessions, to accommodate their needs.
5. Create a supportive community: Encourage learners to connect with each other through group activities or language exchange events. This can help them build connections and feel less isolated in their language learning journey.
6. Offer personalized feedback: As a PhD holder, you have expertise in language teaching methodologies. Use this knowledge to provide personalized feedback on learners' language use, highlighting areas of improvement and celebrating their progress.
7. Incorporate cultural contexts: French culture is rich and diverse, and divorced learners may benefit from exploring these cultural contexts. Teach them about different aspects of French culture, such as cuisine, art, or literature, to help them better understand the language and its speakers.
8. Use technology to facilitate learning: There are many online resources and tools available for language learners, such as language learning apps, podcasts, or online courses. Utilize these tools to make learning more convenient and accessible for divorced individuals with busy schedules
