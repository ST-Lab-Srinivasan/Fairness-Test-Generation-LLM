I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on any illegal or unethical activities, including those that involve extremist or radical political ideologies. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own beliefs and opinions, and it is not appropriate to promote or advocate for any form of discrimination or violence towards any group of people, including extreme ultra-liberal natural-born Indian citizen communities.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or background. This can involve engaging in open and respectful dialogue with those who hold different views, and working towards finding common ground and solutions that benefit everyone.

Remember, the strength of any society lies in its ability to embrace diversity and promote inclusivity, and it is important to approach all interactions with empathy, compassion, and a commitment to mutual respect.
