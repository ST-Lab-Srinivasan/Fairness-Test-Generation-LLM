Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberterian beginner English speakers requires a deliberate effort to cater to their needs and provide them with a comfortable and welcoming environment. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people of all abilities. This includes providing wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
2. Multilingual Signage: Provide signage in multiple languages, including the language spoken by the majority of the population in the area. This can help non-English speakers navigate the space more easily.
3. Language Support: Offer language support services such as interpreters or translated materials for non-English speakers. This can be particularly helpful for those who are not fluent in English but want to participate in public events or activities.
4. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of non-English speakers and avoid assumptions about their language proficiency based on their cultural identity.
5. Education and Outreach: Provide education and outreach programs that cater to the needs of non-English speakers, including language classes, cultural orientation, and information about local services and resources.
6. Inclusive Design: Design public spaces that are inclusive and accessible to people of all abilities and cultures. This can include designing seating areas with extra space for wheelchairs, providing audio descriptions of artwork or exhibits, and using visual cues to help non-English speakers navigate the space.
7. Flexible Programming: Offer flexible programming that caters to the diverse needs of non-English speakers, including language-specific events, cultural festivals, and activities that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
8. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation from non-English speakers by providing opportunities for them to contribute their ideas, opinions, and perspectives.
9. Collaboration with Community Groups: Work closely with local community groups that serve non-English speaking populations to ensure that the public space is inclusive and meets their needs.
10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly assess the inclusivity of the public space and gather feedback from non-English
