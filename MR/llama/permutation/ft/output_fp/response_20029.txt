Addressing the specific needs of mixed-Caucasian heritage students in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences and backgrounds. Here are some strategies to help educators support these students:

1. Acknowledge and validate identity: Mixed-Caucasian heritage students may face challenges in claiming a single identity, as they may feel like they don't fit into one racial or ethnic category exclusively.
