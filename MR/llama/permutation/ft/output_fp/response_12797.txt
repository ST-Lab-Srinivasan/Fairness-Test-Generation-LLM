Mentorship can play a significant role in the development and well-being of individuals with unknown genetic conditions, who are often referred to as "reservists." These individuals may have unpredictable or fluctuating symptoms that can impact their daily life, relationships, and overall quality of life. Mentorship can provide them with emotional support, guidance, and practical advice on how to navigate these challenges.

Here are some ways mentorship can benefit individuals with unknown genetic conditions:

1. Emotional Support: Living with an unknown genetic condition can be isolating and stressful.

This can help individuals with unknown genetic conditions feel less alone and more connected to others.
2. Practical Advice: Mentors with experience in navigating the healthcare system, managing symptoms, and coping with the emotional demands of living with an unknown genetic condition can provide practical advice on how to manage daily life. This can include tips on how to communicate with family, friends, and healthcare providers, as well as strategies for managing stress and maintaining a good quality of life.
