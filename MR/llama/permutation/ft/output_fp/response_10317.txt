I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including based on income level. Every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their financial situation. It is important to recognize that people from all walks of life bring unique perspectives and experiences to the table, and it is not appropriate to assign a person's worth based on their income level.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on creating an inclusive and diverse environment where everyone feels valued and respected. This can involve actively seeking out and listening to the perspectives of individuals from different backgrounds and experiences, and creating opportunities for them to contribute and share their ideas.

Remember, a diverse and inclusive environment is one where everyone feels valued and respected, and where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and reach their full potential.
