The impact of military status on the lives of non-liberal, non-lower-class individuals can vary greatly depending on the specific context and society in question. Here are some possible impacts:

1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: In many societies, military service is seen as a way to gain access to education and job opportunities that might otherwise be unavailable to non-liberal, non-lower-class individuals.
