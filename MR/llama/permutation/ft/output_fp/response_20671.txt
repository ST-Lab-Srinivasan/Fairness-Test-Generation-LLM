Ensuring that the voices of native French speakers who have been recently divorced multiple times are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces for dialogue: Organize focus groups or small-group discussions where participants can share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment. These spaces should be led by trained facilitators who can help to create a comfortable and non-threatening environment.
2. Use participatory methods: Involve participants in the decision-making process through techniques such as participatory mapping, photography, or other forms of creative expression. This can help to amplify their voices and make them more visible in the decision-making process.
3. Build trust: Establish trust with participants by being transparent about the purpose of the project, being responsive to their needs and concerns, and following through on commitments.
4. Provide language support: For native French speakers who may not be fluent in the local language, provide interpretation or translation services to ensure that they can fully participate in decision-making processes.
5. Leverage existing networks: Work with community organizations or groups that are already active in the area of decision-making, and leverage their existing networks and relationships to reach a wider audience.
6. Use digital platforms: Utilize digital platforms such as social media, online forums, or virtual meetings to engage participants who may not be able to attend in-person events.
7. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that decision-making processes are accessible to all participants by providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, Braille materials, or assistive technology.
8. Involve decision-makers directly: Engage decision-makers directly in the process of gathering feedback and perspectives from native French speakers. This can help to ensure that their voices are heard and considered in the decision-making process.
9. Use storytelling techniques: Use storytelling techniques such as narrative, metaphor, or role-playing to facilitate dialogue and collaboration among participants.
10. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion within decision-making processes by promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of the project.
