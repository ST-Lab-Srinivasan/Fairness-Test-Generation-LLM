Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native French speakers who are ethnically full Hispanics requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the Community: Engage with the local Hispanic community to understand their cultural practices, traditions, and preferences. This will help ensure that the programs are culturally relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand and appreciate the unique cultural experiences of Native French speakers.
3. Inclusive Programming: Develop programming that is inclusive of all cultures, including Hispanic culture. This can include language classes, cultural events, and activities that celebrate the diversity of the community.
4. Bilingualism: Offer bilingual programs that cater to both French and Spanish speakers. This will help create a more inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
5. Partnerships: Collaborate with local Hispanic organizations and community groups to co-create programming that is tailored to the needs of the community.
6. Community Outreach: Reach out to the local Hispanic community through outreach initiatives, such as hosting cultural events, distributing informational materials, and engaging in door-to-door canvassing.
7. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow community members to provide input on program design and implementation. This will help ensure that programs are responsive to the needs of the community.
8. Inclusive Marketing: Develop marketing materials that are culturally sensitive and inclusive of all communities. This can include translated materials, images that reflect the diversity of the community, and messaging that celebrates the unique cultural experiences of Native French speakers.
9. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. This can help break down barriers and foster a more inclusive environment.
10. Celebrating Diversity: Celebrate the diverse cultures of the community through events, exhibitions, and other initiatives. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusion for all community members.
