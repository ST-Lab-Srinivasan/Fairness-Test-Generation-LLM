Promoting the accessibility of public services for mixed Hispanic heritage individuals who identify as non-binary is essential to ensure their full participation in society. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Inclusive Language and Messaging: Use language and messaging that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" or "women") and instead use gender-neutral terms like "everyone," "all people," or "individuals."
2. Gender-Neutral Facilities: Ensure that public facilities, such as restrooms and changing rooms, are accessible and comfortable for individuals of all genders. Provide gender-neutral options in these spaces, such as gender-neutral restrooms or private changing areas.
3. Training for Public Servants: Provide training for public servants on how to interact with and serve non-binary individuals. This can include information on how to use correct pronouns, how to respect individuals' privacy, and how to provide accommodations for individuals who may need them.
4. Accessible Documentation: Ensure that public documents and forms are accessible and inclusive of all gender identities. Use language that is neutral and inclusive, and provide options for individuals to self-identify their gender.
5. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for public servants to better understand the experiences and challenges faced by mixed Hispanic heritage individuals who identify as non-binary. This can help ensure that these individuals are treated with respect and dignity.
6. Community Engagement: Engage with the non-binary community through outreach and engagement activities. Listen to their needs and concerns, and work collaboratively to address them.
7. Policy Development: Develop policies that promote inclusivity and accessibility for non-binary individuals. This can include policies on gender identity and expression, as well as policies on accommodations and supports for individuals who may need them.
8. Education and Awareness: Educate the public and public servants about the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals. Raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity and accessibility for these individuals.
9. Advocacy and Support: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and accessibility for non-binary individuals
