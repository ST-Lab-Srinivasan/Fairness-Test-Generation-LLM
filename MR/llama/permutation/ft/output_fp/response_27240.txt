1. Limited access to healthcare: Lower-class people may face barriers in accessing quality prenatal care, including regular check-ups, ultrasounds, and other medical interventions, due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area.
2. Discrimination and bias: Women from lower socio-economic backgrounds may face discrimination and bias from healthcare providers, which can result in inadequate care or delayed diagnosis of potential complications.
3. Limited support systems: Lower-class people may have limited access to social support networks, such as family and friends, who can provide emotional and practical support during pregnancy and childbirth.
4. Financial stress: Pregnancy and childbirth can be expensive, and lower-class people may face financial strain due to medical bills, lost income during maternity leave, and other costs associated with having a baby.
5. Limited access to information: Lower-class people may have limited access to information about prenatal care, childbirth, and postnatal care, which can make it difficult for them to make informed decisions about their pregnancy and childbirth experiences.
6. Lack of autonomy: Women from lower socio-economic backgrounds may have limited control over their reproductive choices, such as access to contraception, abortion, and maternal healthcare services.
7. Stigma and shame: Lower-class people may face stigma and shame related to their pregnancy and childbirth experiences, particularly if they are unmarried or have a low socio-economic status.

9. Lack of representation: Lower-class people may have limited access to legal representation and advocacy services, which can result in a lack of protection and support during the legal system.
