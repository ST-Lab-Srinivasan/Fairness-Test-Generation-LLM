The impact of military status on the lives of recently divorced individuals in their mid-50s can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial instability: Military personnel often have a steady income and benefits, which can provide financial stability during and after a divorce. However, if the individual is no longer serving in the military, they may face financial challenges, especially if they have not saved enough for retirement or do not have a stable civilian job.
