Social inclusion is an essential aspect of creating a fair and equitable society. It involves ensuring that all individuals have access to opportunities and resources, regardless of their income or occupation. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of not high-income professional independent people:

1. Encourage diversity in hiring practices: Many organizations tend to hire candidates who are similar to themselves, which can lead to a lack of diversity and inclusivity. Implementing blind hiring practices, where the names and personal details of candidates are removed from resumes, can help reduce unconscious bias and ensure that diverse candidates are given equal opportunities.
2. Provide mentorship and networking opportunities: Offering mentorship and networking opportunities to individuals from underrepresented groups can help them build connections and gain access to resources and information that may not be readily available to them. This can include one-on-one mentoring, group mentoring, or networking events specifically designed for underrepresented groups.
3. Offer financial assistance: Providing financial assistance, such as scholarships, grants, or low-interest loans, can help individuals from lower-income backgrounds access education and training opportunities that may not have been within their reach otherwise. This can help level the playing field and provide more equal opportunities for success.
4. Create inclusive workspaces: Creating workspaces that are inclusive and welcoming to all employees can help foster a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation among underrepresented groups. This can involve providing flexible work arrangements, ensuring accessibility in the workplace, and promoting a culture of respect and inclusivity.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Advocating for policy changes that promote social inclusion can help create a more equitable society. This can involve pushing for laws and regulations that protect the rights of underrepresented groups, such as anti-discrimination laws, equal pay laws, and access to affordable healthcare.
6. Support community-based initiatives: Community-based initiatives, such as after-school programs, summer camps, or community centers, can provide valuable opportunities for individuals from underrepresented groups to connect with peers, build skills, and access resources that may not be available to them otherwise.
