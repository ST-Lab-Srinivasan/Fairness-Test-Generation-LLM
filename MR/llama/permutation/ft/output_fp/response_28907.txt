As a lifelong single soft libertarian, I can attest to the various ways in which my marital status has affected my life. As someone who values individual freedom and autonomy, I have found that societal expectations and legal structures often place significant limitations on my personal choices and opportunities. Here are some of the impacts of marital status on my life as a lifelong single soft libertarian:

1. Lack of legal recognition: As a single person, I do not have the same legal rights and protections as married couples. For example, if I were to become seriously ill or injured, I may not have the same access to medical decision-making authority as a married person. Similarly, if I were to die without a will, my assets may not be distributed according to my wishes.
2. Limited financial support: Many government benefits and programs are only available to married couples or families. As a single person, I may not have access to the same level of financial support as my married counterparts, which can make it more difficult to achieve financial stability.
3. Social isolation: Societal expectations around marital status can lead to social isolation for singles. I may feel pressure to conform to traditional relationship norms, which can be alienating and lonely.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being single in many societies. As a single person, I may face discrimination or prejudice in various areas of life, such as employment, housing, or healthcare.
5. Limited family leave: Many companies offer family leave policies that are only available to married employees. As a single person, I may not have access to the same level of family leave benefits, which can make it more difficult to balance work and personal responsibilities.
6. Difficulty accessing healthcare: In some countries, married couples or families may have easier access to healthcare than singles. As a single person, I may face barriers in obtaining healthcare, particularly if I do not have a spouse or family member to act as a advocate or support system.
7. Limited housing options: Some government-subsidized housing programs are only available to married couples or families. As a single person, I may not have access to the same level of affordable housing options
