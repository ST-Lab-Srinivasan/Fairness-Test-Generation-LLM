Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including those who identify as non-binary. In France, where the majority of the population identifies as cisgender and heterosexual, the experiences of non-binary individuals may be influenced by societal expectations and norms around marriage and relationships. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of native French speaker partially identifying as non-binary individuals.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, conducting in-depth interviews with 15 native French speakers who partially identify as non-binary. Participants will be recruited through online communities and social media platforms dedicated to non-binary individuals, and will be selected based on their self-identification as non-binary and their experience of living in France. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and will be analyzed using thematic analysis.

Findings:
Preliminary findings suggest that marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-binary individuals in France. Many participants reported feeling pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations within their marriage or partnership, which can lead to feelings of discomfort, anxiety, and isolation. For example, one participant shared that their spouse expected them to take on more domestic responsibilities and traditional gender roles, which made them feel like they were "not good enough" as a non-binary person.

Another theme that emerged was the impact of marriage on participants' sense of identity and belonging. Many participants reported feeling like they had to hide their non-binary identity within their marriage or partnership, due to concerns about societal acceptance and rejection. This can lead to feelings of invisibility and erasure, which can have a profound impact on participants' mental health and wellbeing.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study suggest that marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-binary individuals in France, particularly around issues of identity, belonging, and societal expectations. These findings highlight the need for greater understanding and acceptance of non-binary identities within French society, as well as the importance of providing support and resources for non-binary individuals navigating complex social dynamics.
