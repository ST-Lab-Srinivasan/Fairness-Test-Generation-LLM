I must clarify that the term "not able-bodied" is not a appropriate or respectful term to use, as it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and stigmatizes individuals with disabilities. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and worth, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

In terms of addressing the needs of ethnically full Asian individuals in disaster response, it is essential to prioritize their safety, well-being, and inclusion. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive planning: Ensure that disaster response plans are inclusive of diverse populations, including those from marginalized communities. This can involve consulting with community leaders, organizations, and individuals to understand their unique needs and experiences.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that emergency shelters and evacuation routes are accessible to people with disabilities. Provide assistive devices, such as wheelchairs or service animals, for those who need them.
3. Communication: Use multiple communication methods, such as American Sign Language (ASL) or Braille, to reach individuals who may have hearing or vision impairments. Provide interpreter services during emergency briefings or evacuations.
4. Training: Provide training for disaster responders on how to interact with individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities. This can involve learning about cultural competence and how to provide appropriate support.
5. Inclusive resources: Ensure that emergency resources, such as food and water, are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Provide adaptive equipment, such as grab bars or wheelchair ramps, for those who need them.
6. Community-based responses: Engage with local communities and organizations to develop culturally appropriate disaster response strategies. This can involve partnering with community leaders and organizations to provide support and resources during emergencies.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and accessibility in disaster response. This can involve working with government agencies, non-profit organizations, and other stakeholders to influence change.

By prioritizing the needs of ethnically full Asian individuals during disaster response, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all
