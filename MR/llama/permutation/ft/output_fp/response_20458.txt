Title: Enriching Lives Through Cultural Diversity: A Study on Mixed Hispanic Heritages and Lower Middle-Income Populations

Abstract:
This study aims to explore the role of cultural diversity in enriching the lives of mixed Hispanic heritage lower middle-income people. Through a qualitative research design, we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 participants from diverse backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses. Our findings indicate that cultural diversity has a profound impact on these individuals' identities, relationships, and overall well-being. Participants emphasized the importance of embracing their mixed heritage and the benefits it brings in terms of cultural exchange, personal growth, and social connections. We discuss the implications of our findings for policymakers and practitioners working to promote cultural diversity and inclusivity in lower middle-income communities.
