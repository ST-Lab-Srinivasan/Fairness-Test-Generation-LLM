Promoting the social inclusion of happily newly married couples who are temporary visa holders can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that your community is welcoming and inclusive of all members, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve providing information and resources in multiple languages, offering childcare or other support services during events, and actively seeking out and engaging with newly married couples who may be feeling isolated or excluded.
2. Host community events: Organize events that bring together members of the community, such as potluck dinners, game nights, or volunteer opportunities. This can provide an opportunity for newly married couples to meet and connect with other members of the community, and to build relationships and a sense of belonging.
3. Offer language classes or other skills training: Provide language classes or other skills training that can help newly married couples to integrate into their new community and to find employment or other opportunities. This can also help to build confidence and self-esteem, which can be important for social inclusion.
4. Encourage mentorship: Pair newly married couples with more experienced members of the community who can provide guidance and support as they navigate their new life in a foreign country. This can involve sharing knowledge and experiences, providing emotional support, and helping to build connections within the community.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Work with local authorities and advocacy groups to push for policies that support the social inclusion of temporary visa holders. This can involve advocating for more flexible work permits, increased access to healthcare and other services, and greater protections against discrimination and xenophobia.
6. Provide access to resources: Offer resources such as legal aid, financial planning, and mental health support to help newly married couples navigate the challenges of living in a foreign country. This can also involve connecting them with local organizations that provide these services.
7. Create opportunities for social interaction: Organize events or activities that bring together members of the community, such as sports teams, book clubs, or volunteer groups. This can provide an opportunity for newly married couples to meet and connect with other members of the community, and to build relationships and a sense of belonging.
