Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native English-speaking leftists, as it shapes their identity, values, and beliefs. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences leftist individuals:

1. Critique of dominant culture: Leftists often view mainstream culture as oppressive and exploitative, particularly when it comes to issues like racism, sexism, homophobia, and classism. By critiquing and challenging dominant culture, they aim to create a more equitable society.
2. Emphasis on community: Leftists often place a strong emphasis on building community and solidarity among marginalized groups. This is based on the idea that collective action and mutual support are essential for creating meaningful social change. Cultural heritage can inform this approach by highlighting the importance of communal bonds and shared experiences.
3. Intersectionality: Leftists recognize that different forms of oppression (such as racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.) intersect and overlap.

5. Preservation of marginalized histories: Leftists may prioritize the preservation of marginalized histories and cultures, which have been suppressed or erased by dominant power structures. By highlighting these narratives, they aim to challenge dominant historical accounts and promote a more inclusive understanding of the past.
6. Emphasis on collective action: Leftists often emphasize the importance of collective action and cooperation in bringing about social change. Cultural heritage can inform this approach by highlighting the ways in which marginalized communities have historically worked together to resist oppression and create positive social change.
