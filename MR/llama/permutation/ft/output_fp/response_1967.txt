Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, who are ethnically full Asian individuals, are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to create an inclusive and equitable environment. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space: Establish a comfortable and non-judgmental space where beginners can share their thoughts and feelings without fear of criticism or ridicule. This will help them feel more confident in expressing themselves.
2. Use accessible language: Avoid using complex Arabic grammar or vocabulary that may be challenging for beginners to understand. Instead, use simple and clear language that is easy to comprehend.
3. Provide opportunities for participation: Encourage beginners to participate in decision-making processes by inviting them to share their thoughts and ideas. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or direct interactions.

9. Be patient and flexible: Be willing to adapt and make adjustments to accommodate beginners' needs and
