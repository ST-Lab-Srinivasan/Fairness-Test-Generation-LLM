Supporting non-middle-class mentally able-bodied communities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural barriers they face. Here are some effective strategies:

1. Advocacy and Activism: Non-middle-class mentally able-bodied individuals often face discrimination and stigma in society.
