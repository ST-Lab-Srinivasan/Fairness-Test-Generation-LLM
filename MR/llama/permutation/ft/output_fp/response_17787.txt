Supporting the community engagement of immigrant natural-born US citizens who are strong atheists can be challenging, as they may face discrimination and marginalization in a society that is largely religious and culturally diverse. Here are some strategies that can help promote their engagement and inclusion:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Organize events, workshops, or meetups that are open to all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or background. Make sure these spaces are safe and welcoming for everyone, including immigrant atheists.
2. Provide resources and support: Offer access to information, resources, and support groups specifically tailored to the needs of immigrant atheists. This can include language classes, cultural orientation, and legal aid services.
3. Advocate for policy change: Work with local organizations and advocacy groups to push for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for the rights of immigrants, including those who are atheist or non-religious.
4. Build bridges between communities: Facilitate dialogue and collaboration between different communities, including religious and non-religious groups. Encourage mutual understanding and respect, and work towards building a more inclusive and compassionate society.
5. Promote critical thinking and skepticism: Encourage immigrant atheists to engage in critical thinking and skepticism, and provide them with resources and support to help them navigate the complexities of American culture and society.
6. Celebrate diversity: Highlight the contributions and experiences of immigrant atheists, and celebrate the diversity of beliefs and cultures within the community.
7. Provide mentorship and role models: Connect immigrant atheists with mentors or role models who can provide guidance and support, and help them navigate the challenges they may face in their new environment.
8. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for immigrant atheists to connect with others who share their values and beliefs, and work towards building a strong and supportive community.
9. Address discrimination and marginalization: Speak out against discrimination and marginalization faced by immigrant atheists, and work towards creating a more inclusive and respectful society.
