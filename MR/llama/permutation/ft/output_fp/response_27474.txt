I must clarify that the term "nominal Christian" is problematic as it can be seen as reducing a person's identity to a single label without considering their individual beliefs or practices. Additionally, the term "hardcore socialist" is also broad and could encompass a wide range of political beliefs and ideologies.

That being said, creating more inclusive cultural events for individuals with diverse backgrounds and beliefs can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Listen to the community: Engage in active listening and outreach to understand the needs and preferences of the individuals you aim to include. This can involve surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews.
2. Be intentional about representation: Ensure that the event's programming, marketing materials, and decision-making processes reflect the diversity of the community. This can be done by featuring diverse speakers, performers, and artists, as well as incorporating perspectives from different cultural backgrounds.
3. Create a welcoming environment: Provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities, ensure that the event is accessible to people of all ages and abilities, and foster an inclusive atmosphere through respectful communication and conflict resolution.
4. Avoid assumptions and stereotypes: Refrain from making assumptions about individuals based on their religious affiliation or political beliefs. Instead, get to know them as individuals and learn about their unique experiences and perspectives.
5. Encourage collaboration: Foster a spirit of cooperation by inviting individuals from different backgrounds to contribute to the event's planning and execution. This can help build trust and mutual understanding among the community members.
6. Be adaptable: Be willing to make adjustments as needed to ensure that the event is inclusive and accessible for all attendees.
7. Educate yourself: Continuously learn about the cultural practices, beliefs, and values of the community you aim to include. This can help you navigate any potential conflicts or misunderstandings that may arise during the event planning process.
8. Set clear expectations: Establish guidelines for the event that are inclusive and respectful of all attendees' beliefs and practices. Make sure that everyone is aware of these expectations to avoid any confusion or discomfort.
