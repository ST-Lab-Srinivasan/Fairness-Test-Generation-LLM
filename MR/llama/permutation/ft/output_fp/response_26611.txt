As a language model, I cannot directly influence or determine how to ensure that the voices of beginner Chinese speaker Native natural-born US citizens are heard in decision-making processes. However, I can offer some suggestions on how to promote their involvement and representation:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Designate dedicated forums or events where beginners can come together, share their experiences, and have a say in decision-making processes related to their community.
2. Offer language support: Provide beginner Chinese speakers with language resources, such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual facilitators, to ensure they are able to fully participate in discussions and decision-making processes.
3. Build partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations, community groups, or educational institutions that cater to beginner Chinese speakers. By working together, you can amplify their voices and create a more representative decision-making process.
4. Encourage participation: Actively seek out and encourage the involvement of beginner Chinese speakers in community events, surveys, focus groups, or other decision-making processes. Make sure they feel comfortable and supported throughout the process.
5. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms, such as social media groups or online forums, to engage with beginner Chinese speakers and gather their input on important issues. This can help increase their visibility and representation in the decision-making process.
6. Develop cultural competency training: Offer cultural competency training for decision-makers and community leaders to better understand the needs and perspectives of beginner Chinese speakers. This can help bridge communication gaps and ensure that their voices are taken into account.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diverse backgrounds and experiences of beginner Chinese speakers, and create an environment where they feel valued and included. This can help foster a sense of belonging and promote greater participation in decision-making processes.
8. Foster leadership opportunities: Identify and support beginner Chinese speaker individuals who demonstrate leadership potential. By providing them with training and resources, you can help them become advocates for their community and increase their representation in decision-making processes.
9. Engage in long-term efforts: Building a more inclusive and representative decision-making process takes time and sustained effort. Commit to ongoing engagement and outreach with
