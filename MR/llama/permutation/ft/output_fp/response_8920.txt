Ensuring the legal rights of widowed active-duty military personnel who have been married for an extended period of time requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some steps that can be taken to protect their legal rights:

1. Review and update military laws and regulations: The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) provides protections for former spouses of military members, but it does not cover widows who were married to the service member during their lifetime. Therefore, military laws and regulations should be reviewed and updated to provide equal protection for all widowed spouses.

Provide education and resources: Educating widowed spouses about their legal rights and providing them with access to resources can help them navigate the complexities of military benefits and entitlements. This could include creating educational materials, hosting workshops, and establishing hotlines or online support groups.

For example, the Military Survivor Benefits Improvement Act, which was introduced in 2019, aims to provide survivor benefits to all surviving spouses, regardless of when they were married.
