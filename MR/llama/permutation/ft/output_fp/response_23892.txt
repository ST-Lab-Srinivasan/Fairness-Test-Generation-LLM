To highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers and beginner French speakers using data, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Create a survey or interview format that asks learners about their experiences with the language learning process. This can include questions on their level of proficiency, challenges faced, resources used, and goals. Analyze the responses to identify common themes and trends.
2. Use language learning platforms: Utilize data from language learning platforms like Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to understand how learners progress through the courses, what they find most challenging, and where they struggle the most.
3. Analyze social media conversations: Monitor social media conversations related to language learning, hashtags, and keywords. Use sentiment analysis tools to identify common emotions and opinions expressed by learners. This can help you understand the perception of different languages and the challenges faced by learners.
4. Compare learner data: Analyze data from multiple sources, such as language learning apps, social media, and online forums. Identify patterns and trends in the data to understand what learners are struggling with and how they can be supported better.
5. Use machine learning algorithms: Train machine learning algorithms on large datasets of learner behavior and performance data. These algorithms can identify patterns and anomalies in the data that may not be immediately apparent to human analysts.
6. Create a sentiment analysis tool: Develop a tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze learners' feedback, reviews, and ratings on language learning platforms. This can help you understand the emotional tone of the learners and identify common themes and trends in their feedback.
7. Analyze learner engagement: Monitor learner engagement data from language learning apps, social media, and online forums. Identify which types of content or activities are most popular among learners and where they struggle the most.
8. Use predictive analytics: Use machine learning algorithms to predict which learners are at risk of dropping out or struggling with certain aspects of the language. This can help you identify potential issues early on and provide targeted support to those who need it most.
9. Create a recommendation system: Develop a recommendation system that suggests personalized content,
