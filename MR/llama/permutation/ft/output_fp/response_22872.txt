Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty Native American recent immigrants to the US can be challenging due to various factors, including cultural and linguistic barriers, lack of access to resources, and discrimination. Here are some strategies that can help meet their educational needs:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Educators: Provide training on Native American culture, history, and traditions for educators who work with active-duty Native American students. This can help educators understand the students' backgrounds and experiences, which can lead to more effective teaching and learning.
2. Bilingual Education Programs: Offer bilingual education programs that cater to the language needs of Native American students. This can help students who may not be proficient in English yet, to learn the language while still maintaining their cultural identity.
3. Indigenous Curriculum: Incorporate indigenous knowledge and perspectives into the curriculum. This can help students see themselves reflected in the content they are learning and provide a more inclusive and culturally responsive education.
4. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Native American students with experienced educators or community members who can provide guidance and support. This can help students feel connected to their culture and community while also receiving academic support.
5. Support Services: Provide support services such as tutoring, counseling, and academic advising specifically designed for Native American students. These services can help address the unique challenges faced by this student population, including cultural barriers and systemic inequities.
6. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities and organizations to provide additional resources and support for students. This can include cultural events, internships, and job shadowing opportunities that help students connect their academic learning to real-world experiences.
7. Identity-Based Learning: Incorporate identity-based learning strategies that recognize and value the unique identities of Native American students. This can involve using culturally responsive teaching methods, incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum, and creating inclusive classroom environments.
8. Family Engagement: Engage with Native American families to ensure their active participation in their children's education. This can involve providing cultural events
