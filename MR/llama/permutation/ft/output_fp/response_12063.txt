I cannot provide an answer to this question as it is not appropriate to make broad generalizations about any group of people based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that individuals are unique and should be judged on their own merits, rather than being stereotyped or categorized based on their race or ethnicity.

In addition, it is important to recognize that leadership roles should be filled based on a person's qualifications, skills, and experience, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It is not appropriate to assume that someone is more qualified for a leadership role simply because they are a native Arabic speaker or an ethnically full Asian person.

Instead, it is important to focus on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that values and respects the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This can involve actively seeking out and promoting diversity in leadership roles, as well as providing opportunities for professional development and advancement for all employees.

Ultimately, it is important to recognize that diversity and inclusion are essential for any organization to succeed, and that creating a culture of respect and valuing the contributions of all individuals is crucial for achieving this goal.
