This can include workshops on communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution, as well as access to mentorship programs and professional development opportunities.

6. Institutional Change: Advocate for institutional changes that promote greater inclusion and representation of NESEFAAs in decision-making processes. This can involve pushing for policy reforms, advocating for diversity and inclusion initiatives, and challenging systemic barriers to participation.
