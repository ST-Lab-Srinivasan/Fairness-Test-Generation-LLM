Ensuring that the voices of native Chinese speakers are heard in decision-making processes after a spouse's death can be challenging, especially when there are language barriers involved. However, here are some potential strategies that can help:

1. Use interpreters or translators: Hire professional interpreters or translators who are fluent in both English and the native Chinese speaker's language to facilitate communication during decision-making processes. This can ensure that the native Chinese speaker's voice is heard and understood.
2. Provide language support: Offer language classes or cultural sensitivity training to those involved in decision-making processes to help them better understand and communicate with native Chinese speakers.
