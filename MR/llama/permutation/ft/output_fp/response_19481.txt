Promoting the educational success of Native American recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who are ultra-conservative, requires a multifaceted approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that educators, administrators, and policymakers can consider:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American immigrants may face cultural barriers in the US education system. Teachers can use culturally responsive teaching practices to create an inclusive learning environment that values their students' backgrounds and promotes academic success. This includes using student-centered teaching methods, incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into curricula, and fostering positive relationships between teachers and students.
2. Bilingual education: Many Native American immigrants may speak indigenous languages as their primary language at home. Providing bilingual education programs or support services can help these students maintain their cultural identity while also developing English language proficiency. This can involve hiring bilingual teachers, providing language classes, or using dual-language instructional materials.
3. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporating indigenous knowledge and perspectives into curricula can help Native American immigrant students feel more connected to their heritage and culture. This includes including traditional ecological knowledge, cultural practices, and historical context in lessons. By valuing and respecting students' cultural backgrounds, educators can promote academic engagement and success.
4. Community partnerships: Building partnerships with local Native American communities can provide opportunities for student involvement, cultural enrichment, and language revitalization. These partnerships can involve collaborative projects, mentorship programs, or community-based learning experiences that help students connect with their heritage and culture.
5. Identity-safe spaces: Creating identity-safe spaces in schools can help Native American immigrant students feel more comfortable and confident in their academic environment. This includes promoting cultural competence among teachers and peers, providing safe spaces for students to share their experiences and perspectives, and fostering a sense of belonging among students from diverse backgrounds.
6. Parent engagement: Engaging with parents and families is crucial for the educational success of Native American immigrant students. This involves providing opportunities for parental involvement in school decision-making processes,
