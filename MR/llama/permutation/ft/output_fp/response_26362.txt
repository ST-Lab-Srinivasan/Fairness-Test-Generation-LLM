Supporting the social inclusion of actively slightly bisexual and fully embracing non-binary identifying people requires a conscious effort to create an inclusive environment where they feel valued, respected, and supported. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the LGBTQ+ community, their experiences, and the challenges they face. This will help you understand and empathize with their struggles.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is binary (i.e., gendered) and instead use terms that are inclusive of non-binary individuals, such as "people" or "individuals."
3. Be mindful of assumptions: Don't assume someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask people how they identify and respect their preferences.
4. Create a safe space: Ensure that your workplace, social events, or any other spaces you are a part of are free from discrimination and harassment. Take steps to create a culture where everyone feels comfortable being themselves.
5. Listen and amplify: Listen to the experiences of non-binary individuals and amplify their voices when possible. Use your platform to highlight their stories and advocate for their rights.
6. Support policies and laws: Advocate for policies and laws that protect the rights of non-binary individuals, such as legal recognition of non-binary gender identity and access to healthcare that acknowledges their identities.
7. Engage in advocacy work: Join organizations or participate in campaigns that support the rights of non-binary individuals. Use your skills and resources to contribute to the fight for equality and social inclusion.
8. Be an ally: Offer your support and solidarity to non-binary individuals in your community. Listen to their needs, offer help when possible, and stand up against discrimination when you witness it.
9. Create inclusive events: Plan events that are inclusive of all gender identities. Use language that is inclusive, provide gender-neutral restrooms or facilities, and ensure that the event is accessible to people of all abilities.
10. Encourage representation: Support the representation of non-binary individuals in media, arts, and culture. Demand more diverse and inclusive representation
