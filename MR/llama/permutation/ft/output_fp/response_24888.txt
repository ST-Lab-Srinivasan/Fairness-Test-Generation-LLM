4. Academic Support Services: Offer academic support services such as tutoring, academic advising, and learning strategies workshops to help immigrant students improve their academic performance.

6. Community Resources: Connect recent immigrant students with community resources such as legal aid organizations, health clinics, or social services that can provide additional support outside of the educational setting.
7. Collaboration with Immigrant Organizations: Partner with local immigrant organizations to better understand the needs of immigrant students and provide targeted support. These organizations may offer language classes, cultural events, or other resources to help immigrant students succeed academically and socially.
