6. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or cultural appropriation. Be mindful of the cultural significance of traditional practices and avoid using them as a form of entertainment without proper understanding, permission, or credit.
7. Offer educational materials or workshops that provide context and history of different cultures. This can help participants better understand and appreciate the cultural programs they are participating in.
8. Encourage collaboration between different cultural groups. Facilitate opportunities for artists, musicians, dancers, and other cultural practitioners to come together and create new works that reflect the diversity of the community.

10. Continuously evaluate and improve your cultural programs. Solicit feedback from participants and incorporate
