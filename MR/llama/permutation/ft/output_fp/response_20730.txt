As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "deeply lower-class" is not a recognized social class category in the United States. The US Census Bureau recognizes five main categories of socioeconomic status: poorest, low-income, moderate-income, middle-income, and high-income. Additionally, it's important to recognize that Native Americans are not a monolithic group and have diverse experiences within their communities.

That being said, there are significant challenges faced by many Native American individuals in the healthcare system, including:

1. Access to care: Many Native American communities face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to lack of transportation, limited healthcare providers in rural areas, and cultural and linguistic barriers.
2. Cultural humility: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, leading to misunderstandings or mistranslations that can impact patient care.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages, and there may be limited availability of healthcare providers who are fluent in these languages.
