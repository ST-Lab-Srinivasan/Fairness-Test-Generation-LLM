Creating more inclusive cultural events for actively partially identifying as non-binary individuals who also identify as extreme ultra-liberal requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities, such as "they/them" pronouns instead of "he/him" or "she/her." Avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is wheelchair accessible and has a gender-neutral restroom. Provide ASL interpreters or live captioning for deaf individuals, as well as materials in braille or large print for those with visual impairments.
3. Gender-Neutral Programming: Design the event's programming to be inclusive of all genders.

4. Performers: Choose performers who are representative of the community you are trying to include. This could mean featuring non-binary performers or those from underrepresented communities.
5. Inclusive Artwork: Use artwork that is inclusive of all genders and avoids perpetuating harmful stereotypes or binaries. Consider partnering with local organizations that support non-binary individuals to create the event's visual identity.
6. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for non-binary individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Provide a quiet room or designated area where participants can retreat if they need privacy or respite from the event's energy.
7. Workshops and Panel Discussions: Offer workshops and panel discussions that are inclusive of non-binary identities and address topics relevant to this community, such as the intersectionality of non-binary identity with other forms of oppression like race or class.
8. Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that support non-binary individuals to co-create the event and ensure its accessibility and inclusivity. This could include partnering with
