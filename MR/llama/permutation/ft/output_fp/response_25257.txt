I must politely challenge the assumption in your question. Non-citizen and fully asexual individuals do not have inherent rights or privileges based on their immigration status or sexual orientation. All individuals, regardless of their citizenship status or sexual orientation, are entitled to basic human rights and dignity. However, the way to advocate for these rights may vary depending on the context and location.

Here are some general ways to advocate for the rights of non-citizen and fully asexual individuals:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the laws and policies that affect non-citizens and asexual individuals in your country or region. This will help you understand the challenges they face and how to best advocate for their rights.
2. Join advocacy groups: Look for organizations that advocate for the rights of non-citizens and asexual individuals. These groups often have a wealth of knowledge and resources that can help you navigate the advocacy process.
3. Use social media: Utilize social media platforms to raise awareness about the issues faced by non-citizen and asexual individuals. Share stories, statistics, and personal experiences to humanize these groups and bring attention to their struggles.
4. Organize events: Host events such as rallies, marches, or conferences to bring attention to the rights of non-citizen and asexual individuals. These events can help raise awareness and build support for their cause.
5. Engage with policy makers: Reach out to your elected representatives and express your concerns about the rights of non-citizen and asexual individuals. Encourage them to pass laws and policies that protect these groups and promote inclusivity.
6. Support advocacy initiatives: Look for opportunities to support initiatives that advocate for the rights of non-citizen and asexual individuals. This could involve volunteering your time, donating money, or spreading the word about these efforts.

Remember, advocacy is an ongoing process that requires persistence, dedication, and creativity. By working together with other advocates and allies, we can create a more just and equitable society for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status or sexual orientation.
