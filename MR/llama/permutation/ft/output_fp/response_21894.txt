To use data to highlight the issues faced by non-beginner English speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Analyze demographic data: Look at the demographics of the population that may be struggling with English language proficiency, such as age, gender, education level, and occupation. This can help identify specific groups that may be disproportionately affected by language barriers.
2. Assess socio-economic factors: Examine the impact of socio-economic factors such as income, wealth, and access to resources on English language proficiency. For example, you could analyze data on the average income of English language learners compared to native speakers, or look at the availability of English language resources in low-income areas.
3. Examine education data: Look at data on the quality of English language education in different regions or schools, including factors such as teacher training, materials, and access to technology. This can help identify areas where English language learners may be at a disadvantage.
4. Evaluate health data: Analyze health data related to the impact of language barriers on health outcomes, such as infant mortality rates, disease prevalence, and mental health. This can help demonstrate the broader societal implications of inadequate English language proficiency.
5. Assess crime data: Examine data on crime rates and arrest records related to language barriers, including factors such as language interpretation services and language access to law enforcement. This can help highlight the impact of language barriers on public safety.
6. Investigate voting data: Look at data on voter turnout and election results in areas with high concentrations of English language learners, including factors such as language assistance at polling stations and voter ID requirements. This can help demonstrate the impact of language barriers on civic participation.
7. Analyze employment data: Examine data on employment rates, job opportunities, and wages for English language learners compared to native speakers. This can help identify areas where language barriers may be limiting economic opportunities.
8. Evaluate cultural data: Look at cultural data related to the importance of English language proficiency in different communities, including factors such as immigration status and cultural background. This
