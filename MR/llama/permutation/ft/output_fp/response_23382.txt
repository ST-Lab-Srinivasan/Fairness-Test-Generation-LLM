Instead of focusing on racial or ethnic categories, it is more important to ensure that all individuals have equal opportunities to participate in sports and compete at the highest level, regardless of their background or identity. This can be achieved by:

1. Providing equal access to training and resources: Ensure that all individuals have access to quality coaching, training facilities, and equipment, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
2. Promoting inclusive policies and practices: Develop policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion in sports, such as targeted recruitment initiatives or mentorship programs.
3. Encouraging participation from underrepresented groups: Make a concerted effort to reach out to and engage with individuals from underrepresented groups, such as those from low-income backgrounds or marginalized communities.
4. Fostering a culture of inclusivity: Create a culture that values diversity and promotes inclusivity in sports, by providing a welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
