It is important to note that the term "lower middle-income" is a socioeconomic classification and does not necessarily reflect an individual's race or ethnicity. However, I understand your question to be referring to challenges faced by African Americans in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by this population:

1. Limited access to care: Many African Americans face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to systemic inequalities and discrimination. They may live in areas with limited healthcare resources, have less insurance coverage, or experience delays in receiving care.
2. Health disparities: African Americans are disproportionately affected by various health issues, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. These health disparities can be attributed to a lack of access to preventive care, inadequate health education, and cultural barriers.
3. Implicit bias: Healthcare providers may unconsciously hold biases against African Americans, which can result in inadequate care or delayed diagnosis. For instance, research has shown that doctors are more likely to undertreat black patients than white patients with similar symptoms.
4. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained in addressing the unique health needs and cultural practices of African Americans. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and mistrust.
5. Distrust of the medical system: Historical abuses and discrimination within the medical system have led to a lack of trust among some African American communities. This can make it challenging for individuals to seek preventive care or follow treatment recommendations.
6. Limited health literacy: Some African Americans may face challenges understanding complex medical information due to limited English proficiency, low educational attainment, or cognitive limitations. This can lead to misunderstandings of medical instructions and decreased ability to advocate for one's own health.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Discrimination and stigma based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status can negatively impact an individual's mental health and well-being. This can lead to delayed seeking of medical care or exacerbate existing health conditions.
8. Limited availability
