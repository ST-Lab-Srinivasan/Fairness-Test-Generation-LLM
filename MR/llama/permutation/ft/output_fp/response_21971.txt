Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled individuals with children, particularly those who are undocumented or in a mixed-status family. Here are some potential effects:

1. Fear of deportation and separation from family: Undocumented immigrants may live in constant fear of being detected and deported, which can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This fear can also cause significant emotional distress for children who may worry about being separated from their parents or experiencing a traumatic event.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including prenatal care, due to fear of disclosing their immigration status. This can lead to delayed or inadequate medical care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the child's health.
3. Financial instability: Undocumented immigrants may face financial challenges due to limited access to employment opportunities and resources. They may struggle to provide for their basic needs, including food, shelter, and clothing, which can have a profound impact on their overall well-being and that of their children.
4. Social isolation: Undocumented immigrants may feel isolated and excluded from society due to their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety, which can affect not only the individual but also their children.
5. Limited access to education: Children of undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing quality education due to their immigration status. They may be denied access to certain programs or services, or they may experience bullying and discrimination from their peers.
6. Fear of law enforcement contact: Undocumented immigrants may fear encountering law enforcement, which can lead to anxiety and stress for both the individual and their children. This fear can also limit access to essential services, such as healthcare and legal aid.
7. Limited job opportunities: Children of undocumented immigrants may face limited job opportunities due to their parent's immigration status. They may be denied access to certain jobs or industries, which can limit their future career prospects.
