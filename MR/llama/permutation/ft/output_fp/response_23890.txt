There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: Create online surveys or polls to gather data on the challenges faced by beginner English speakers. You can ask questions about their language learning experience, such as how long they have been studying, what difficulties they encounter, and what they hope to achieve.
2. Analyze language learning metrics: Use analytics tools to track progress in language learning apps or websites. For example, you could analyze the number of words learned, time spent practicing, or correctness of grammar exercises.
3. Study language learning patterns: Use data visualization techniques to study how people learn English. For example, you could create a chart showing how often beginners make mistakes in specific areas of language, such as verb tenses or article usage.
4. Examine language learning resources: Analyze the types of resources used by beginner English speakers, such as textbooks, podcasts, or online courses. You could also study the effectiveness of different resources based on user engagement and progress metrics.
5. Investigate social media activity: Use social media analytics tools to track hashtags related to language learning, identify popular accounts and posts, and analyze user-generated content. This can provide insights into the types of language learning challenges faced by beginner English speakers on social media platforms.
6. Conduct case studies: Select a group of beginning English learners and conduct in-depth interviews or observations to gather data on their language learning experiences. This can help identify specific challenges and barriers to language acquisition.
7. Compile statistical reports: Collect and analyze data from various sources, such as language learning apps, websites, or social media platforms.
