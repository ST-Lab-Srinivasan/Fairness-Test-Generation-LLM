Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-early pregnant (1st trimester), partly asexual individuals requires careful consideration and thoughtful planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs of the community: It's essential to listen to the needs and preferences of the community you're trying to serve. Conduct surveys or focus groups to understand the specific requirements of non-early pregnant, partly asexual individuals. This will help you tailor your events to meet their needs.
2. Offer virtual events: For individuals who may feel uncomfortable attending in-person events during their first trimester, consider offering virtual events. This could include webinars, online workshops, or virtual cultural festivals. This way, they can participate from the comfort of their own homes.
3. Provide accommodations: Ensure that your events are accessible to all by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, gender-neutral restrooms, and quiet spaces for those who may need them. You could also consider offering sensory-friendly activities or materials for individuals with sensory sensitivities.
4. Be mindful of language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (e.g., "men" and "women") and instead use more inclusive terms such as "people," "individuals," or "communities."
5. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee for your event reflects the diversity of the community you're serving. This could include individuals from different gender identities, abilities, and cultural backgrounds. By doing so, you can ensure that a variety of perspectives are represented and that the event is inclusive of all attendees.
6. Offer activities for all: Plan activities that cater to a wide range of interests and needs. This could include art workshops, music performances, or cultural exhibitions that are accessible to all.
7. Provide education and resources: Consider offering educational materials or workshops on topics such as gender identity, sexuality, and inclusivity. This can help create a more informed and empathetic community.
8. Be flexible: Be open to feedback and willing to make changes if necessary.
