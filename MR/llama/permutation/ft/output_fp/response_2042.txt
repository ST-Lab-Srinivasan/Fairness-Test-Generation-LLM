Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and awareness for program staff and volunteers. This can help them understand the unique needs and experiences of the African American community and avoid any unintentional offense or marginalization.
2. Inclusive programming: Develop cultural programs that are inclusive and representative of diverse backgrounds. For example, include music, dance, and art forms that are popular in the African American community, such as blues, jazz, hip-hop, and Afrobeats.
3. Partnership with local organizations: Collaborate with local African American organizations to co-create cultural programs that cater to their needs and interests. This can help build trust and credibility within the community.
