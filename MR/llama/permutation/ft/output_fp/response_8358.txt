Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development and well-being of Native American recent immigrants to the US, particularly for those who are over the age of 65 (and even more so for those who are over 85). Here are some ways mentorship can benefit this population:

1. Cultural preservation: Mentorship can help recent immigrants connect with their Native American culture and heritage, which may have been lost or forgotten over time due to assimilation. A mentor can share traditional knowledge, language, and practices, helping the mentee preserve their cultural identity.
2. Navigating a new society: For many Native American recent immigrants, the US is a vastly different society than what they were familiar with in their home country. A mentor can help them navigate this new environment by providing guidance on everyday tasks, such as using public transportation or accessing healthcare services.
3. Building social connections: Mentorship can help recent immigrants build social connections and community, which is essential for mental and emotional well-being. A mentor can introduce the mentee to other Native American individuals and organizations, helping them feel less isolated and more connected to their community.
4. Overcoming language barriers: Many Native American recent immigrants may face challenges with language barriers due to the lack of fluency in English or their native language. A mentor can help them improve their language skills, which can lead to greater access to resources and opportunities.
5. Accessing resources: Mentors can provide mentees with information about available resources such as healthcare services, educational institutions, and legal aid. This can be particularly important for older adults who may have limited mobility or access to transportation.
6. Building self-esteem and confidence: Mentorship can help recent immigrants build their self-esteem and confidence by providing them with positive reinforcement and encouragement. This can be especially important for older adults who may have faced discrimination or marginalization throughout their lives.
7. Preserving cultural knowledge: Older Native American recent immigrants may have valuable cultural knowledge and skills that they want to pass on to younger generations. A mentor can help them document and share their experiences, traditions, and practices with the community.
