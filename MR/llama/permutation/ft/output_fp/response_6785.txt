Creating more inclusive social policies for employed individuals who are not widowed requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the changing nature of work: With the rise of the gig economy and automation, many people are facing uncertain and unstable employment situations. Policies should recognize this reality and provide support for individuals who may be experiencing job insecurity or uncertainty.
2. Provide financial assistance: Many employed individuals who are not widowed face financial challenges due to factors such as stagnant wages, lack of benefits, and high levels of debt. Policies should offer financial assistance, such as tax credits, low-interest loans, or other forms of support, to help individuals manage their finances and plan for the future.
3. Address caregiving responsibilities: Many employed individuals are balancing work and caregiving responsibilities, which can be a significant source of stress and burnout. Policies should provide support for caregivers, such as flexible work arrangements, parental leave, or respite care services.
4. Foster diversity and inclusion: Employed individuals who are not widowed may face discrimination or marginalization based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, or other aspects of their identity. Policies should promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace and ensure that all individuals have equal opportunities for advancement.
5. Encourage lifelong learning: The job market is changing rapidly, and many employed individuals may need to upskill or reskill to remain competitive. Policies should encourage lifelong learning and provide resources for continuing education and professional development.
6. Address mental health: Employed individuals who are not widowed may face mental health challenges related to work-related stress, long working hours, or other factors. Policies should prioritize mental health support and provide resources for employees to manage their well-being.
