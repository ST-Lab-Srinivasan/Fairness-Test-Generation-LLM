The impact of military status on the lives of non-conservative individuals extends beyond those who are above the poverty line. Here are some of the ways in which military status can affect the lives of non-conservative individuals:

1. Limited political participation: Military service members and their families may face limitations on their ability to participate in political activities, such as voting or protesting, due to their military status. This can limit their ability to express their political views and participate fully in the democratic process.
2. Discrimination and stigma: Non-conservative individuals in the military may face discrimination and stigma based on their political beliefs. They may be seen as a threat to the military's values and norms, or as being unpatriotic. This can lead to social isolation and marginalization.
3. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: When non-conservative individuals leave the military, they may find it difficult to adjust to civilian life. They may struggle to relate to civilians who do not share their experiences or understand their perspective. This can lead to feelings of disconnection and isolation.
4. Limited job opportunities: Non-conservative individuals in the military may face limitations on their job opportunities after leaving the military. Employers may view them as a liability or a risk, rather than as a valuable asset. This can limit their ability to find employment that aligns with their skills and experience.
5. Lack of support: Non-conservative individuals in the military may not have access to the same level of support as conservative individuals. They may not have the same opportunities for advancement or promotion, or they may face discrimination and marginalization within their units.
6. Internal conflict: Non-conservative individuals in the military may experience internal conflict between their political beliefs and their military duties. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and burnout, both for the individual and their family members.
7. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: Non-conservative individuals in the military may find it difficult to navigate the bureaucracy of the military. They may face obstacles in accessing benefits or resources due to their political beliefs, or they may feel overwhelmed by the red tape
