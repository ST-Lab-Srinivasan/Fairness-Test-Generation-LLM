Promoting the accessibility of public services for individuals over the age of 90 who are still employed is crucial to ensure they continue to contribute to society and live fulfilling lives. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to achieve this goal:

1. Age-friendly policies: Implement policies that promote age-friendly environments, such as accessible transportation, housing, and public spaces. This can include things like wheelchair-accessible buses, affordable senior housing, and parks and recreational areas that are easy to navigate.
2. Technology solutions: Utilize technology to improve accessibility, such as mobile apps for transportation, telemedicine, and video conferencing for remote consultations. This can help older workers who may have mobility or hearing impairments to continue working without facing barriers.
3. Flexible work arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements that allow older workers to continue working while also accommodating their needs. For example, providing telecommuting options, flexible schedules, or job-sharing opportunities can help older workers balance their work and personal responsibilities better.
4. Training and education: Provide training and education on age-related issues such as healthy aging, ageism, and how to support older workers. This can help managers and coworkers understand the unique challenges faced by older workers and provide appropriate support.
5. Health and wellness programs: Offer health and wellness programs that cater to the specific needs of older workers. This can include exercise classes tailored for older adults, health screenings, and mental health resources.
6. Age-friendly workplaces: Design workspaces that are age-friendly, with features such as ergonomic furniture, good lighting, and noise reduction. This can help reduce the risk of injury or strain associated with aging.
7. Legal protections: Ensure that laws and regulations are in place to protect older workers from age discrimination and promote their continued employment. This can include enforcing anti-age discrimination policies, providing reasonable accommodations, and ensuring equal pay for equal work.
8. Intergenerational mentorship: Encourage intergenerational mentorship programs that pair older workers with younger colleagues. This can help share knowledge and skills,
