Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American and recent immigrant individuals to the US, including strong atheists.

Her cultural heritage can help her navigate these intersections and find solidarity with others who share similar experiences.
5. Cultural preservation: Cultural heritage can serve as a means of preserving traditions, languages, and practices that are critical to a community's survival. For example, the revitalization of indigenous languages has been an important aspect
