Ensuring that the voices of native Arabic speakers, particularly those who have gone through multiple divorces, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and social justice. Here are some strategies to achieve this goal:

1. Create safe spaces for storytelling: Facilitate workshops or focus groups where participants can share their experiences without fear of judgment. This will help build trust and create a safe environment for individuals to express themselves.
2. Use participatory methods: Incorporate participatory methodologies, such as community mapping, into your research design. These methods encourage active participation from all members of the community, including marginalized groups.
3. Build partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that work with native Arabic speakers and have expertise in promoting social justice. These organizations can help disseminate information and reach a wider audience.
4. Use multilingual approaches: Develop research materials and tools that are available in multiple languages, including the native language of the participants. This will enable individuals who may not be fluent in the dominant language to participate more easily.
5. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that all research activities are accessible to participants with disabilities. This can include providing sign language interpretation, Braille materials, or other accommodations as needed.
6. Foster intergenerational connections: Connect younger and older members of the community through mentorship programs or peer-to-peer learning opportunities. This will provide a platform for individuals to share their experiences and knowledge with each other.
7. Engage in advocacy efforts: Work with local advocacy groups to raise awareness about the importance of including marginalized voices in decision-making processes. This can include organizing campaigns, writing op-eds, or participating in community events.
8. Use art and creative expression: Encourage participants to express themselves through art, music, or other forms of creative expression. This can help to amplify their voices and make their experiences more visible to decision-makers.
9. Provide training and capacity building: Offer workshops or training sessions that equip participants with the skills and knowledge necessary to participate in decision-making processes. Topics could include advocacy, leadership, and community organizing.
