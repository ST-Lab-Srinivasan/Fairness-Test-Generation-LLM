Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of separated beginner Spanish speaker individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from generation to generation within a particular group or society. For individuals who are learning Spanish as a second language, their cultural heritage can influence their language learning experiences, attitudes towards the language, and the way they interact with native speakers.

1. Shaping language learning experiences:
a) Internalization of linguistic and cultural values: Beginner Spanish speakers' cultural backgrounds can impact how they internalize linguistic and cultural values associated with Spanish. For instance, if a speaker comes from a culture that places a high value on direct communication, they may find it challenging to adjust to the more indirect communication style found in Spanish-speaking cultures.
b) Attitudes towards the language: Beginner Spanish speakers' cultural heritage can shape their attitudes towards the language. For example, if a speaker comes from a culture that values education and intellectual pursuits, they may be more likely to view learning Spanish as a desirable and worthwhile activity. On the other hand, if a speaker comes from a culture that prioritizes practicality and functionality over creativity and expression, they may find it challenging to engage with the more expressive and poetic aspects of Spanish language and culture.
2. Interacting with native speakers:
a) Cross-cultural communication: Beginner Spanish speakers' cultural heritage can impact how they communicate with native speakers. For instance, if a speaker comes from a culture that places a high value on eye contact and direct communication, they may find it challenging to navigate the more subtle and nuanced forms of communication found in some Spanish-speaking cultures.
b) Building relationships: Beginner Spanish speakers' cultural heritage can also influence how they build relationships with native speakers. For example, if a speaker comes from a culture that values respect for elders and authority figures, they may be more likely to show deference to older or more experienced native speakers. On the other hand, if a speaker comes from a culture that prioritizes egalitarianism and informality, they may be more comfortable interacting with native speakers on an equal footing.
