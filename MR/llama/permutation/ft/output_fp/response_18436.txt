Creating more inclusive social policies for non-lower-class, non-recently widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various forms of discrimination and marginalization they face. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Acknowledge and address intersectionality: Non-lower-class, non-recently widowed individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination based on their race, gender, sexuality, ability, or other aspects of their identity. Policies should take an intersectional approach, recognizing how these different forms of discrimination intersect and compound, leading to unique experiences of marginalization.
2. Challenge ableism: Non-lower-class, non-recently widowed individuals with disabilities or chronic illnesses may face significant barriers to accessing social services. Policies should prioritize accessibility and inclusion, such as providing accommodations in employment, education, and healthcare.
3. Address ageism: Non-lower-class, non-recently widowed individuals who are older or younger than the traditional "working age" may face discrimination based on their age. Policies should recognize the value of older individuals' experience and wisdom, while also providing support for young people to enter the workforce and access education and training.
4. Promote gender equality: Non-lower-class, non-recently widowed individuals who are women may face gender-based discrimination in various areas of life, such as education, employment, and political representation. Policies should aim to address these disparities and promote gender equality.
5. Address racism: Non-lower-class, non-recently widowed individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups may face discrimination and marginalization based on their race or ethnicity. Policies should actively work to dismantle systemic racism and promote diversity and inclusion.
6. Prioritize affordable housing: Non-lower-class, non-recently widowed individuals may struggle to access affordable and secure housing, leading to instability and insecurity. Policies should prioritize affordable housing options, such as rent control or subsidized housing, to ensure that all individuals have a safe and stable place to live.
