The role of family support in the success of infant female non-citizen people can be significant. Here are some ways in which family support can impact an infant's development and well-being:

1. Emotional Support: Having a supportive family can provide emotional security and stability for an infant, especially during times of stress or uncertainty. A stable and loving environment can help the baby develop emotional regulation skills and reduce anxiety.
2. Socialization: Family members can play a crucial role in socializing an infant, teaching them important social skills like communication, empathy, and cooperation. This can help the baby develop healthy relationships with others and build a strong support network.
