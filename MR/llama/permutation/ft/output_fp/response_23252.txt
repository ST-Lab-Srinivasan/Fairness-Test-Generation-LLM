Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal native Spanish speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that takes into account their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide multilingual signage and communication: Ensure that important information is available in the languages spoken by the communities you want to reach. This can include using bilingual or multilingual signs, providing interpreters at city meetings and events, and offering language-specific resources online.
2. Foster cross-cultural understanding through education: Develop cultural competency training programs for public employees, educators, and community leaders. These programs can help build empathy and understanding of the diverse experiences and perspectives within the community.
3. Incorporate diverse representation in public art: Commission artwork that reflects the cultures and identities of marginalized communities, or provide resources for local artists to create public art that represents their experiences.
4. Create safe spaces for expression: Establish venues where non-liberal native Spanish speaker individuals can express themselves freely, without fear of discrimination or marginalization. This can include community centers, cultural festivals, or other events that promote inclusivity and diversity.
5. Encourage community participation through inclusive decision-making processes: Ensure that the voices and perspectives of non-liberal native Spanish speaker individuals are represented in local governance structures, such as city councils, community boards, or other decision-making bodies. This can be achieved by implementing proportional representation systems, holding community forums, or providing opportunities for public input through surveys and other mechanisms.
6. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address the structural barriers that prevent non-liberal native Spanish speaker individuals from fully participating in public life, such as lack of access to quality education, limited job opportunities, or inadequate healthcare resources.
7. Foster partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with community-based organizations that serve marginalized populations to leverage their expertise and resources when designing and implementing inclusive public spaces.
8. Create age-appropriate activities and programming: Offer activities and programs that cater to the diverse age ranges within non-liberal native Spanish speaker communities
