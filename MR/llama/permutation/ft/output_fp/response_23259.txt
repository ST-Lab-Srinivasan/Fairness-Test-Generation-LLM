Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-socialist beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make public spaces more welcoming and accessible for individuals who are not fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese:

1. Provide multilingual signage: Use signs and labels in multiple languages, including English, to help non-Chinese speakers navigate public spaces. This can include street names, building directions, and important information.
2. Offer language classes or workshops: Organize language classes or workshops for non-Chinese speakers to learn basic phrases and vocabulary related to public spaces. This can help them feel more comfortable and confident when interacting with locals.
3. Provide audio guides or tours: Develop audio guides or tours that cater to non-Chinese speakers, providing information in their preferred language. This can be especially helpful for tourists who may not be able to read Chinese characters.
4. Hire multilingual staff: Train staff in public spaces, such as museums, parks, and libraries, to communicate with visitors in multiple languages. This can include Mandarin, Cantonese, and English.
5. Create bilingual or multilingual marketing materials: Develop marketing materials, such as brochures, flyers, and posters, in multiple languages to reach a wider audience.
6. Host cultural events: Organize cultural events that celebrate diversity and inclusivity, such as language festivals or multicultural fairs. These events can help promote understanding and appreciation of different cultures and languages.
7. Offer translation services: Provide translation services for non-Chinese speakers who may need assistance communicating with local authorities or businesses. This can include translating important documents, such as medical records or legal documents.
8. Install language-neutral technology: Utilize technology that does not require proficiency in Chinese characters, such as voice-controlled elevators or smart traffic lights.
9. Encourage diverse representation: Ensure that public spaces reflect the diversity of the community by promoting images and stories of non-Chinese speakers. This can help create a more inclusive environment for everyone.
10. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that
