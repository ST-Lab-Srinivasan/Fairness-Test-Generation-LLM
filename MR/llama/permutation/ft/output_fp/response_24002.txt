5. Visual Aids: Use visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to help beginners communicate their ideas and thoughts when they struggle with language barriers.
6. Active Listening: Encourage active listening among all team members by promoting non-verbal cues, body language, and facial expressions that show empathy and understanding.
7. Simplified Language: Use simplified language in meetings and discussions to help beginner English speakers follow the conversation and contribute their ideas more easily.
8. Inclusive Meetings: Hold regular inclusive meetings where all team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas, regardless of their language proficiency level.
