1. Accessibility Features: Ensure that the venue or event space is wheelchair-accessible, has accessible restrooms, and provides seating for individuals who may need it. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Inclusive Marketing: Use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful of all disabilities. Avoid using terms like " disabled" or "handicapped," which can be seen as stigmatizing. Instead, use language that emphasizes ability and participation, such as "individuals with physical disabilities" or "people with mobility challenges."
3. Involve Disability Community: Consult with disability organizations and individuals with disabilities to ensure that the cultural program is inclusive and meets their needs. This can involve gathering feedback through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews.

8. Accessible Communication: Provide accessible communication, such as large print, braille, or electronic communications, to ensure that all participants have access to information about the cultural program.
9. Inclusive Funding: Ensure that funding for the cultural program is inclusive and
