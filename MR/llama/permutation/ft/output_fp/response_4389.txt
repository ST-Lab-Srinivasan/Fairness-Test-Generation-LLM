Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-binary identifying individuals, including actively fully embracing non-binary retired veterans, requires a deliberate effort to challenge traditional gender norms and stereotypes. Here are some ways to create a more inclusive environment:

1. Use gender-neutral language: Avoid using binary gender language (he/she, men/women) and instead use gender-neutral terms like "they" or "them." This small change can help create a more inclusive atmosphere.
2. Include non-binary identities in cultural celebrations: Make sure that non-binary individuals are represented in your cultural celebrations, such as by including non-binary characters in decorations, costumes, or performances.
3. Provide gender-neutral accommodations: Offer gender-neutral restrooms and changing areas to ensure that all individuals feel comfortable and included.
4. Avoid assumptions based on gender: Refrain from making assumptions about someone's gender identity or expression based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask individuals how they prefer to be referred to or addressed.
5. Educate yourself and others: Learn about non-binary identities and the challenges faced by non-binary individuals in society. Share this knowledge with your community to promote understanding and acceptance.
6. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for non-binary individuals to participate in cultural celebrations, such as through performances, art exhibitions, or other forms of expression.
7. Be mindful of dress codes: Avoid enforcing strict gendered dress codes that may make non-binary individuals feel uncomfortable or excluded. Instead, offer flexible dress code options that allow for self-expression without reinforcing binary gender norms.
8. Involve non-binary community members in planning and decision-making: Consult with non-binary individuals and organizations to ensure that their perspectives are taken into account when planning cultural celebrations. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and avoid unintentionally excluding non-binary individuals.
9. Offer gender-neutral awards and recognition: Avoid giving awards or recognition based solely on binary gender categories, instead offer gender-neutral options to recognize the contributions of all individuals.
10. Be patient and open-minded
