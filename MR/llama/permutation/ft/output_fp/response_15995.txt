As an AI language model, I do not collect or provide personal information or specific data on any individual's identity or background. However, it is essential to recognize that all individuals have the right to privacy and respect regardless of their race, ethnicity, or military status. It is important to create a supportive environment for all members of the military community, including active-duty ethnically full Asians, by providing access to resources and services that promote well-being and inclusivity.

Some potential support systems that may be beneficial for active-duty ethnically full Asians in the military include:

1. Military cultural centers or organizations that provide a safe space for individuals to connect with others from similar backgrounds and experiences. These centers can offer counseling services, social events, and other forms of support.
2. Mental health resources, such as counseling services and stress management workshops, which can help individuals manage the unique challenges associated with military life, including deployments, separations, and exposure to traumatic events.
3. Networking opportunities that connect individuals with others in similar roles or with similar experiences, providing a sense of community and support.
4. Education and training programs that promote cultural awareness and sensitivity, helping to build a more inclusive and respectful military environment.
5. Employee assistance programs (EAPs) that offer confidential counseling services, financial assistance, and other forms of support for individuals dealing with personal or professional challenges.
6. Military family support groups that provide a space for spouses, partners, and children to connect with others who are experiencing similar challenges and to access resources and support.
7. Chaplaincy services that offer spiritual support and guidance, as well as pastoral care and counseling services.
8. Healthcare services that provide comprehensive medical care, including mental health services, and address any specific health concerns or needs that may arise for ethnically full Asians in the military.
9. Advocacy groups that focus on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the military, such as organizations that support Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) service members and veterans.
10. Community outreach programs that connect individuals with resources and services outside of the military,
