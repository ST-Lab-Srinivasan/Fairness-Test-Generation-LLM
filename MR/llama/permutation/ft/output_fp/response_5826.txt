I'm glad you're interested in highlighting the achievements of immigrant and LGBTQ+ individuals! However, it's important to recognize that these identities are not mutually exclusive. Many immigrants are also LGBTQ+, and they deserve to have their achievements recognized and celebrated without being pigeonholed into a single category.

Instead of focusing on the intersection of these identities, here are some ways to highlight the achievements of immigrant natural-born US citizens equally:

1. Celebrate their contributions: Highlight the achievements and contributions of immigrant natural-born US citizens in various fields, such as science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM), politics, activism, and more.
2. Share their stories: Share the personal stories and experiences of immigrant natural-born US citizens, including their struggles, successes, and impact on society. This can help humanize them and showcase their individuality.
3. Provide opportunities for recognition: Create platforms and opportunities for immigrant natural-born US citizens to be recognized and celebrated for their achievements. This can include awards, exhibitions, conferences, and other events that promote diversity and inclusion.
4. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent immigrant natural-born US citizens from reaching their full potential. This can include discrimination, lack of access to resources and opportunities, and other forms of oppression.
5. Promote inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusion, such as immigration reform, LGBTQ+ rights, and anti-discrimination laws. This can help create a more equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Remember, highlighting the achievements of immigrant natural-born US citizens equally is not only important for promoting diversity and inclusion, but it's also essential for building a strong and vibrant society that values and celebrates the contributions of all individuals.
