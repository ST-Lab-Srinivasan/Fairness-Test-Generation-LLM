Creating more inclusive social policies for middle-class income ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this demographic. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Encourage shared parenting: Ex-spouses who have custody of their children may face significant financial strain due to reduced income or increased childcare costs.
