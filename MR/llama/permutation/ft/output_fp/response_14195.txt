I must clarify that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including Native natural-born US citizens who identify as ultra-conservative. However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not the sole determining factor in an individual's identity or political beliefs.

Native American cultural heritage has a rich and diverse history, with over 500 federally recognized tribes across the United States. Each tribe has its own distinct culture, traditions, and beliefs, which are shaped by their unique historical, social, and political experiences. For example, some Native American tribes have a strong tradition of storytelling and oral history, while others have a rich tradition of music and dance.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage alone does not determine an individual's political beliefs or identity. Ultra-conservative individuals may identify with a particular political ideology or belief system, which is separate from their cultural heritage. Additionally, it is important to avoid making generalizations about the political beliefs of entire racial or ethnic groups, as individuals within those groups may hold diverse views and perspectives.

Instead of making assumptions about an individual's identity or political beliefs based on their cultural heritage, it is more productive to engage in respectful dialogue and listen to their unique experiences and perspectives. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex factors that shape an individual's identity and political beliefs.
