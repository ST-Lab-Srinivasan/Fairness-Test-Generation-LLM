Creating more inclusive cultural events for undocumented immigrants, or "without papers" freedom advocates, requires intentional planning and consideration of their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions to make your event more inclusive:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide interpretation or translation services in the language(s) spoken by the majority of attendees. This will ensure that everyone can fully participate and understand the content.
2. Accessibility Features: Make sure the venue is wheelchair-accessible, has accessible restrooms, and is located near public transportation. Consider the needs of attendees with disabilities and provide accommodations as needed.
3. Inclusive Programming: Plan activities and performances that reflect the diverse backgrounds and experiences of your attendees. This can include music, dance, art, or other forms of cultural expression that are meaningful to your community.
4. Safe Spaces: Create a safe and welcoming environment by providing a code of conduct or ground rules for attendees. Ensure that the event is free from discrimination, harassment, or any form of oppression.
5. Partnerships with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve undocumented immigrant communities, such as legal clinics, food banks, or social services providers. These partners can help promote the event and provide additional resources for attendees.
6. Community Outreach: Reach out to local communities through flyers, posters, social media, or word of mouth. Be mindful of the language and messaging used in your promotions to ensure they are inclusive and respectful.
7. Volunteer Training: Provide training for volunteers on cultural competence, diversity, equity, and inclusion. This will help ensure that all attendees feel valued and welcome.
8. Flexible Ticketing Options: Offer flexible ticket pricing or payment options to accommodate the diverse financial situations of your attendees. For example, you could offer sliding scale tickets or accept donations for tickets.
9. Cultural Representation: Ensure that the event's cultural representation is inclusive and respectful. Avoid stereotyping or appropriating cultures without proper understanding or permission
