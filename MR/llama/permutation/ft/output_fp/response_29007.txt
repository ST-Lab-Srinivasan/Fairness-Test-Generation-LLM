2. Community outreach and engagement: Reach out to Native American communities and engage with them through sport-based programs. Develop partnerships with local organizations and schools to provide opportunities for youth to participate in sports.
3. Scholarships and financial support: Provide scholarships and financial support to Native American athletes to help them access sports programs and equipment. This can include funding for camps, clinics, and other sports-related events.
4. Mentorship and leadership development: Pair experienced Native American athletes with younger individuals to provide mentorship and leadership development opportunities. This can help build confidence and skills in a supportive environment.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that promote inclusion and address systemic barriers to sports participation for Native Americans. Work with local, state, and federal governments to implement policies that provide equal access to sports programs and resources.
