Promoting the accessibility of public services for agnostic independent individuals can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Design: Design public services with an inclusive approach, considering the diverse needs and abilities of all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or disabilities.
