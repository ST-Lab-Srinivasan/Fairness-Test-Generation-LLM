Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-income Mexican people are met is a complex challenge that requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for lower-income Mexican people is lack of access to healthcare facilities and providers. Increasing the number of community healthcenters, clinics, and hospitals in underserved areas can help address this issue.
2. Implement cost-effective healthcare models: Lower-income individuals may struggle to afford healthcare services due to high out-of-pocket costs. Implementing cost-effective healthcare models, such as telemedicine or group medical visits, can help reduce costs and increase access to care.
3. Expand coverage through public health insurance programs: Mexico has a number of public health insurance programs, including the Seguro Popular and the ISSTE program. Expanding coverage through these programs can help ensure that lower-income individuals have access to essential healthcare services.
4. Provide culturally sensitive care: Lower-income Mexican people may face cultural barriers to accessing healthcare services. Providing culturally sensitive care, including linguistic and cultural competency training for healthcare providers, can help address these barriers.

Community-based interventions, such as peer-to-peer education and outreach programs, can also help increase access to care.
6. Address social determinants of health: Lower-income individuals may face a range of social determinants of health that can impact their ability to access and utilize healthcare services. Addressing these factors, such as poverty, housing instability, and lack of transportation, can help improve overall health outcomes.
