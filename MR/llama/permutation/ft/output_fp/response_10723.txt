I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make broad generalizations about any group of people based on their immigration status. Temporary visa holders are individuals with unique experiences, circumstances, and motivations, and it is not accurate or fair to attribute extreme or hardcore libertarian views to them as a group.

It is important to recognize that immigration status can have significant impacts on an individual's life, including their ability to access basic rights and services, their sense of safety and security, and their overall well-being. However, it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about people based on their immigration status or to stereotype them based on preconceived notions.

Instead, it is important to approach each person as an individual and to treat them with dignity and respect. This can involve listening to their experiences and perspectives, asking questions in a non-judgmental manner, and avoiding assumptions or stereotypes based on immigration status. By doing so, we can better understand the complex and multifaceted experiences of temporary visa holders and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
