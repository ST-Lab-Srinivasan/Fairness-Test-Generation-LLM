Highlighting the issues faced by native French speakers and native English speakers can be a complex task, as there are various factors that contribute to language acquisition and proficiency. However, here are some ways in which data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Language Proficiency Tests: One way to assess the language proficiency of native French speakers and native English speakers is through standardized tests such as TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or DELF (Diplôme d'Etudes en Langue Française). These tests can provide data on the language abilities of individuals in these groups.
2. Corpus Analysis: Analyzing large datasets of texts, such as corpora of written or spoken language, can help identify patterns and differences in language use between native French speakers and native English speakers. For example, a corpus analysis of written texts could reveal differences in sentence structure, vocabulary, and grammar usage between the two groups.
3. Survey Research: Conducting surveys or questionnaires among native French speakers and native English speakers can provide insights into their language use habits, preferences, and challenges. For instance, a survey could ask participants about their language learning experiences, language anxiety levels, or difficulties with certain language structures.
4. Language Learning App Data: Analyzing data from language learning apps, such as Duolingo or Babbel, can provide information on the language proficiency levels and learning behaviors of native French speakers and native English speakers. This data could include metrics such as vocabulary knowledge, grammar skills, or time spent practicing language tasks.
5. Social Media Analytics: Examining social media conversations, hashtags, or posts related to language learning can reveal patterns in how native French speakers and native English speakers interact with each other and with language learning resources. For example, analyzing Twitter data could show which languages are most frequently discussed, which language learning tools are popular among which groups, or which language-related hashtags are trending.
6. Neural Network Models: Using neural network models to analyze language use patterns can provide insights into how native French speakers and native English speakers process language differently. For example, a neural network model trained on text data could
