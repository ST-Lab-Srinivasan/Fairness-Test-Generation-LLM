As a senior citizen (over 65 years old) or a beginner Chinese speaker, navigating the legal system in China can present several challenges. Here are some of the common issues faced by this group:

1. Language barrier: For those who are not fluent in Chinese, understanding legal terminology and procedures can be difficult. The language used in legal documents, court proceedings, and legal consultations is often complex and technical, making it hard for non-native speakers to comprehend.
