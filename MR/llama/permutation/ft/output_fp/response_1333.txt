As a linguist and advocate for language learner rights, I believe it is essential to create an inclusive and supportive environment where the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who are recent single individuals, can be heard in decision-making processes. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Create a safe space for language learners: Establish a welcoming and non-intimidating environment where language learners feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This could involve setting up regular meetings or events specifically designed for language learners, where they can freely discuss their ideas and concerns without fear of judgment.
2. Encourage participation: Actively seek out the involvement of beginner Chinese speakers in decision-making processes related to language learning. For example, you could ask them to share their thoughts on what would make a particular language learning resource more accessible or enjoyable for them. By doing so, you can ensure that their voices are heard and valued.
3. Foster a sense of community: Build a supportive community around beginner Chinese speakers, particularly recent single individuals. This could involve creating online groups or forums where they can connect with one another, share experiences, and provide mutual support. By fostering a sense of belonging and connection among language learners, you can create an environment where their voices are more likely to be heard.
4. Provide opportunities for leadership: Identify beginner Chinese speakers who have demonstrated leadership potential and provide them with opportunities to take on leadership roles within the language learning community. This could involve assigning them to lead language exchange events or creating a mentorship program where they can guide and support other language learners.
5. Use accessible communication channels: Make sure that decision-making processes are accessible to beginner Chinese speakers by using communication channels that are easy for them to understand and navigate. For example, you could use simple language and provide visual aids to help explain complex concepts.
6. Involve language learners in the design of language learning resources: Encourage beginner Chinese speakers to participate in the design and development of language learning resources, such as textbooks or mobile apps. By doing so, you can ensure that these resources are tailored to their needs and preferences, and that they have a say in how they are designed and implemented.
7. Celebrate diversity
