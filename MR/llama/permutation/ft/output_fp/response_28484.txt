Addressing the specific needs of Native American natural-born US citizens in education requires a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach that considers their unique cultural background, experiences, and perspectives. Here are some strategies to address their specific needs:

1. Culturally responsive curriculum: Develop curricula that incorporate Native American history, culture, and traditions. This can help students feel more connected to their heritage and culture, which is essential for their overall well-being and academic success.
2. Indigenous language revitalization: Support the preservation and revitalization of Native American languages by integrating language classes into the educational curriculum. This can help students develop a stronger connection to their cultural identity and improve their language proficiency.
3. Traditional knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and practices into science and environmental education. This can help students understand the interconnectedness of human and natural systems and foster a deeper appreciation for the natural world.
4. Community-based learning: Foster partnerships with Native American communities to co-create educational programs and activities that are grounded in their cultural values and practices. This can help students feel more invested in their education and better understand the relevance of what they are learning.
5. Trauma-informed teaching: Recognize the historical trauma faced by Native American communities and incorporate trauma-informed teaching strategies into classroom instruction. This can help students feel safer and more supported in their educational journey.
6. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship opportunities for Native American students, including peer mentoring programs and one-on-one mentoring with experienced educators or community members. This can help students develop a sense of belonging and connection to their peers and community.
7. Cultural events and activities: Host cultural events and activities that celebrate Native American traditions and practices. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for all students.
8. Professional development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for educators to learn about the cultural backgrounds of Native American students, how to teach culturally responsive curriculum, and how to address the unique needs of these students in the classroom.
