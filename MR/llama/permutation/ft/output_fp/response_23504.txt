I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to your question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about a person's identity or political beliefs based on their cultural heritage. Identity and political beliefs are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simple categorizations such as "mixed Hispanic heritage" or "non-socialist."

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage and identity are not fixed or static, but rather dynamic and constantly evolving. Individuals may identify with multiple cultures and ethnicities, and their political beliefs may change over time based on a variety of factors such as personal experiences, education, and social and political events.

It is important to approach conversations about identity and politics with sensitivity and respect for the diversity of individuals' experiences and beliefs. Rather than making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their cultural heritage, it is more productive to engage in open and respectful dialogue that recognizes the complexity and individuality of each person's identity and political beliefs.
