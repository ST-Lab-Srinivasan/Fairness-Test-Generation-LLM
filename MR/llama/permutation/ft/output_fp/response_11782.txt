Addressing the specific needs of formerly newly married beginner Arabic speakers in education requires a tailored approach that considers their unique circumstances and priorities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Emphasize practical language use: Beginners may not need to learn complex grammar rules or vocabulary, but rather focus on using the language practically in everyday situations. Provide examples of common phrases and conversations that they might encounter in their daily lives as newly married couples.
2. Incorporate cultural contexts: Arabic culture is rich and diverse, and understanding the cultural context can help learners navigate social situations more effectively. Include information on common customs, traditions, and values to help learners better communicate with their spouses and communities.
3. Offer flexible learning formats: Many newly married couples may have busy schedules or limited time for language learning. Offer flexible learning formats such as online courses, mobile apps, or community classes that cater to their needs and preferences.
4. Foster a supportive environment: Beginners may feel nervous or self-conscious about speaking Arabic, especially if they are not native speakers. Create a supportive learning environment where learners can practice speaking and listening without fear of criticism or judgment.
5. Encourage interactive learning: Interactive learning activities can help beginners build confidence in their language skills. Use role-playing exercises, group discussions, and other interactive methods to engage learners and promote language use.

7. Teach communication strategies: Beginners may struggle with communication issues due to language barriers or cultural differences. Teach strategies for effective communication, such as active listening, clarifying questions, and non-verbal cues.
8. Encourage peer learning: Pair learners with more advanced speakers or native speakers who can provide guidance and support. This can help beginners build confidence in their language skills and learn from each other's experiences.
9. Offer opportunities for cultural immersion:
