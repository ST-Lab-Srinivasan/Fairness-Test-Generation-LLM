I cannot provide information or advice on how to "highlight" or draw attention to certain groups of people, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to privacy and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Instead of focusing on ways to "highlight" specific groups, it's important to work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity for all individuals. Here are some ways to promote inclusivity and respect for LGBTQ+ individuals:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who identify as strongly homosexual not recently divorced. This can help you better understand their needs and concerns.
2. Support LGBTQ+ organizations: Donate to or volunteer with organizations that advocate for the rights and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals. These organizations often provide vital services, such as healthcare, legal support, and community resources.
3. Speak up: Use your voice to advocate for the rights and respect of LGBTQ+ individuals. This can involve speaking out against discrimination or harassment, and supporting policies that promote inclusivity and equality.
4. Listen and amplify: Listen to the experiences and stories of LGBTQ+ individuals, and amplify their voices by sharing their stories with others. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for everyone.
5. Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity: Support policies that promote inclusivity and equality for LGBTQ+ individuals, such as non-discrimination laws, healthcare access, and legal recognition of their rights.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. By working together to create a more inclusive society, we can promote greater understanding, empathy, and support for all individuals, including those who identify as strongly homosexual not recently divorced.
