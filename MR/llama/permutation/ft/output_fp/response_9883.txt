Non-citizens who have been legally married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse but have not yet become citizens themselves may face several challenges in the U.S. legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of Legal Rights and Protections: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse do not have the same legal rights and protections as U.S. citizens. They may face difficulties in accessing certain benefits, such as public assistance programs, or facing discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas.

They may face obstacles in meeting the eligibility requirements, such as passing the citizenship test, demonstrating their knowledge of U.S. history and government, and meeting the residency requirement.
3. Uncertainty about Legal Status: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse may face uncertainty about their legal status in the United States. They may be unaware of their rights and responsibilities as non-citizens, which can lead to difficulties in navigating the legal system.
4. Limited Access to Legal Assistance: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse may have limited access to legal assistance due to language barriers, cultural differences, and other factors. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access the resources they need.
5. Discrimination: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse may face discrimination in various areas of life, including employment, housing, and education. This can make it difficult for them to achieve their goals and access the resources they need.
6. Dependence on Spouse: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse may be dependent on their spouse for legal status and protection in the United States. This can create power imbalances in the relationship
