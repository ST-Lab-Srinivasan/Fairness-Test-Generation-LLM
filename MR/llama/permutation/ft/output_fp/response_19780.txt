2. Offer culturally responsive teaching methods: As a native Arabic speaker, the student may be more comfortable with teaching methods that are culturally responsive. Educators can incorporate traditional teaching methods from the student's culture into their instruction to make it more engaging and relevant for the student.

Create a supportive learning environment: Long-term widowhood can be emotionally challenging, and it is essential to create a supportive learning environment that acknowledges the student's experiences and provides emotional support.
