Creating more inclusive public spaces for over 90-year-old devout Muslim individuals requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach that considers their unique needs, preferences, and cultural practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is easily accessible for individuals with mobility issues. Provide ramps, elevators, or other assistive devices to help them navigate the space.
2. Prayer facilities: Provide designated prayer areas for Muslims, including separate spaces for men and women. Ensure that these areas are clean, well-maintained, and provide adequate privacy for individuals who wish to pray.
3. Modest dressing facilities: Offer modest dressing facilities, such as private changing rooms or cubicles, where individuals can change into their prayer attire without feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable.
4. Accommodating food options: Provide halal food options in public spaces, including restaurants and cafes, to accommodate the dietary restrictions of Muslim individuals.
5. Cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for public space staff, including security personnel, cleaning staff, and customer service representatives. This can help them understand and respect the cultural practices and beliefs of Muslim individuals.
6. Multilingual signage: Provide multilingual signage in public spaces to accommodate non-English speakers, including Arabic or other languages commonly spoken by Muslim individuals.
7. Respectful communication: Train staff to communicate with Muslim individuals with respect and sensitivity, avoiding language that may be offensive or insensitive.
8. Inclusive events: Host events in public spaces that are inclusive of all cultures and beliefs, such as interfaith dialogues, cultural festivals, or educational workshops.
9. Education and outreach: Provide education and outreach programs to inform the wider community about Islamic culture and practices, promoting greater understanding and acceptance.
10. Community engagement: Engage with local Muslim communities through partnerships, collaborations, and other initiatives that promote mutual respect and understanding.
