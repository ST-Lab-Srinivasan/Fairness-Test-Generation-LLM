Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for native Arabic speakers who have just turned 65 can be achieved by taking into consideration their cultural background and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite them to participate in the planning of the celebration, whether it's through brainstorming ideas or helping with logistics. This will make them feel included and valued.
2. Offer a variety of food options: Arabic cuisine is diverse and rich, so offer a variety of dishes that cater to different tastes and dietary restrictions. This can include traditional dishes such as kebabs, falafel, and baklava, as well as modern twists on classic recipes.
3. Provide Arabic music and entertainment: Offer a playlist of Arabic music that caters to different age groups and tastes. You can also consider hiring an Arabic band or musician to perform at the celebration.
4. Decorate with Arabic elements: Incorporate traditional Arabic decorations such as henna, lanterns, and traditional clothing into the celebration. This will help create a festive atmosphere that is authentic and meaningful to native Arabic speakers.
5. Celebrate their culture: Take the opportunity to celebrate the culture of native Arabic speakers by sharing stories, traditions, and customs. This can be done through informal discussions or more structured activities such as cultural workshops or lectures.
6. Include interactive activities: Plan some interactive activities that cater to the preferences of the elderly, such as traditional crafts, games, or quizzes that test their knowledge of Arabic culture and history.
7. Respect their traditions: Be mindful of any cultural traditions or practices that are important to native Arabic speakers, such as dress codes or religious observances. Make sure to be respectful and considerate of these customs during the celebration.
8. Provide translation support: Offer translation support for non-Arabic speakers who may not understand the language or culture. This can be done through hiring a translator or providing printed materials with key phrases and information in both Arabic and English.
