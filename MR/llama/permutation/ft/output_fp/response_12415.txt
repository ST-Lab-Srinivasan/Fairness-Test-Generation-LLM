I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to prioritize the cultural diversity and enrichment of one particular racial or ethnic group over others. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

It is important to recognize that cultural diversity and exchange can benefit everyone involved, regardless of their background. However, it is not productive or respectful to frame this as a competition where some groups are inherently more valuable or deserving than others.

Instead, we should strive to create an inclusive and equitable society where all individuals have the opportunity to contribute and benefit from cultural exchange. This can involve learning about and appreciating different cultures, fostering cross-cultural understanding and empathy, and working towards a more inclusive and diverse society for everyone.
