5. Healthcare Access: Ensure access to quality healthcare services, including mental health support, for individuals in these communities who may face barriers due to discrimination, stigma, or lack of access.
6. Education and Scholarships: Provide educational resources and scholarship opportunities to help mixed Hispanic heritage students access higher education and pursue their career goals.
7. Media Representation: Promote diverse representation in media and popular culture to challenge stereotypes and promote a more inclusive understanding of mixed Hispanic heritage identities.
