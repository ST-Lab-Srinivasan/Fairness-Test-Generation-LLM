Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Temporary Visa Holders: A Case Study of Nigerian Immigrants

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identity and sense of belonging of immigrant communities. For temporary visa holders, cultural heritage can provide a sense of connection to their homeland and community, even when they are physically away. This case study explores the role of cultural heritage in the lives of Nigerian temporary visa holders living in the United States.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can influence immigrants' mental health, well-being, and social integration (Hsu et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2018). For temporary visa holders, cultural heritage can be especially important as it provides a sense of continuity and belonging despite the uncertainty and insecurity of their immigration status.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews with 20 Nigerian temporary visa holders living in the United States. Participants were purposely selected from different states and cities to ensure geographic diversity. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes related to cultural heritage.

Results:
Four major themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) Cultural Identity, (2) Connection to Homeland, (3) Community Support, and (4) Resilience.

1. Cultural Identity: Nigerian temporary visa holders in the United States expressed a strong connection to their cultural heritage, which provided a sense of identity and belonging. They valued their traditional dress, food, music, and language as important symbols of their Nigerianness.
2. Connection to Homeland: Despite being physically away from their homeland, participants maintained a strong emotional connection to Nigeria through cultural practices, traditions, and rituals. This connection helped them feel grounded and rooted in their cultural identity.
3. Community Support: Cultural heritage served as a source of community support for temporary visa holders. Participants found solace in shared cultural practices and traditions with other Nigerians, which helped alleviate feelings of loneliness
