Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deeply lower-class native Arabic speaker people are met can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to improve their access to quality healthcare. Here are some suggestions:

1. Culturally Sensitive Care: Healthcare providers should be trained to understand and respect the cultural beliefs and practices of deeply lower-class native Arabic speaker people. This includes being aware of their dietary restrictions, religious practices, and social norms that may impact their healthcare experience.
2. Language Access: Providing interpreters and translators who are fluent in both Arabic and the local language can help ensure that these individuals receive accurate diagnoses and treatment options. This can be especially important for those with limited literacy skills or who may not speak the dominant language of the region.
3. Community Outreach: Engaging in community outreach and education efforts can help raise awareness about the importance of preventive care, disease management, and healthy lifestyle choices. This can be done through culturally appropriate materials, such as pamphlets, posters, or videos, that are distributed in the local language.
4. Mobile Health Services: Establishing mobile health clinics or telemedicine services can help reach those who may face barriers to accessing healthcare facilities. These services can provide on-site screenings, consultations, and treatment, as well as connect patients with specialists and other healthcare providers.
5. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partnering with local community organizations, such as mosques, community centers, or religious groups, can help reach those who may be difficult to reach otherwise. These organizations can provide a platform for outreach and education efforts, as well as serve as access points for healthcare services.
6. Capacity Building: Building the capacity of local healthcare providers, particularly in rural areas, can help ensure that these individuals have access to quality healthcare. This can involve training healthcare workers, providing them with necessary equipment and supplies, and supporting the development of healthcare facilities.
