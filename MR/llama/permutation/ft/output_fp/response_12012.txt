Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native English speaker immigrant natural-born US citizens requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Understand the diverse backgrounds of participants: Before designing any cultural program, it's essential to understand the diverse backgrounds of the participants. Conduct surveys or hold focus groups to gather information about their cultural practices, values, and beliefs. This will help you tailor the program to meet their needs and interests.
2. Be intentional with language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms like "native English speakers" or "immigrants," which can be perceived as exclusive. Instead, use terms like "English language learners" or "newcomers."
3. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse perspectives and representations. Use a variety of media, such as videos, music, and artwork, to showcase different cultures and traditions.
4. Create intercultural dialogue: Encourage participants to share their experiences and traditions through intercultural dialogue. This can be done through small group discussions, cultural workshops, or even virtual events.
5. Provide interpretation services: Offer interpretation services during the program to ensure that all participants can understand and participate fully. Use interpreters who are fluent in the participants' languages and cultures.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming environment where everyone feels included and valued. Encourage participants to share their experiences and traditions, and provide opportunities for them to connect with one another.
7. Be adaptable: Be willing to adjust the program based on feedback from participants. Listen to their suggestions and concerns, and make changes accordingly.
8. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local community organizations that serve diverse populations. This can help you reach a broader audience and ensure that your program is inclusive of all cultures.
9. Provide cultural education: Offer cultural education workshops or classes to teach participants about different cultures and traditions. This can help build bridges between communities and promote cross-cultural understanding.
