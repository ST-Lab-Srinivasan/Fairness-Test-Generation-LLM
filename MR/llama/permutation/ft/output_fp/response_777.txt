Introduction:

Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals who carry them, particularly in societies where there is a stigma attached to disabilities. In China, the impact of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions can be even more pronounced due to cultural and social factors. This study aims to explore the impacts of disability status on the lives of carrier individuals with beginner Chinese speaker people who are affected by genetic conditions.

Impact on Social Relationships:

Carriers of genetic conditions may experience challenges in forming and maintaining social relationships due to the stigma attached to their condition. Beginner Chinese speaker people may face discrimination, social isolation, and limited access to social support networks. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, low self-esteem, and depression.
