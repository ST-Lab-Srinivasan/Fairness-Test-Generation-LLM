Creating more inclusive community events for ex-military and low-income individuals can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify and address accessibility barriers: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for people with mobility issues, and provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, accessible restrooms, and parking spaces. Offer sign language interpretation or captioning for deaf or hard-of-hearing attendees.
2. Provide financial assistance: Offer scholarships or discounted tickets to low-income individuals to attend the event. Partner with local organizations that support ex-military and low-income communities to help promote the event and provide financial assistance.
3. Promote diversity and inclusion: Ensure that the event's marketing materials, including flyers, posters, and social media posts, are inclusive and respectful of all communities. Use language and imagery that reflects the diversity of the community, and avoid stereotypes or biases.
4. Offer diverse programming: Create a program that caters to different interests and needs of attendees. For example, offer workshops on job skills, financial planning, mental health support, and cultural events that reflect the diversity of the community.
5. Build a welcoming environment: Train event staff and volunteers to be culturally sensitive and respectful of all attendees. Encourage attendees to share their experiences and perspectives through open dialogue and listening sessions.
6. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that support ex-military and low-income communities to co-host the event. These organizations can provide valuable expertise, resources, and networks to help make the event more inclusive and successful.
7. Offer childcare and transportation services: Provide childcare services for attendees with young children, and offer transportation services for those who may not have access to reliable transportation.
8. Incorporate storytelling and dialogue: Use storytelling and dialogue to highlight the experiences and challenges faced by ex-military and low-income individuals. This can help create a sense of empathy and understanding among attendees
