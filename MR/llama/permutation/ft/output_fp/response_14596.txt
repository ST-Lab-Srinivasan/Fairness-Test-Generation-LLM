Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout practicing Hindus from the upper lower middle-income group requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their beliefs and practices: It is essential to understand the beliefs, values, and practices of this community to create programs that are sensitive to their cultural and religious background. Conduct research or consult with Hindu leaders and practitioners to gain a deeper understanding of their needs and preferences.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Invite members of the community to participate in the planning and development of cultural programs. This will help ensure that the programs are tailored to their interests and meet their expectations.
3. Provide opportunities for spiritual growth: Create programs that offer opportunities for spiritual growth, such as meditation sessions, yoga classes, or prayer meetings. These can be held in a designated space within the cultural center or in other locations convenient to the community.
4. Promote traditional Hindu arts and crafts: Showcase traditional Hindu arts and crafts, such as handloom weaving, bronze casting, or papier-mâché crafting. Organize workshops or classes where members of the community can learn these skills and create their own art pieces.
5. Celebrate Hindu festivals and events: Organize cultural programs that celebrate Hindu festivals and events, such as Diwali, Holi, or Navaratri. These events can include traditional music, dance, and cuisine, providing an opportunity for the community to come together and celebrate their shared heritage.
6. Create a community space: Develop a dedicated space within the cultural center where members of the community can gather, socialize, and engage in cultural activities. This could be a multi-purpose room with amenities such as a library, gallery, or performance area.
7. Offer scholarships or financial assistance: Provide financial support to those who may not have the means to participate in cultural programs. This can include scholarships or subsidies for program fees, transportation costs, or other expenses related to participation.
8. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for younger and older members of the community to connect and learn from each other. Organize intergenerational workshops
