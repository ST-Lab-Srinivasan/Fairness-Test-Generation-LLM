These partnerships can help amplify the voices of beginner Chinese speaker individuals and ensure that their perspectives are represented in decision-making processes.

This can involve working with community leaders, policymakers, or other stakeholders to raise awareness about the needs and concerns of beginner Chinese speaker individuals.
