During the third trimester of pregnancy, moderately active individuals may face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Limited mobility: As the baby grows and the abdomen expands, it can become more difficult for expectant mothers to move around easily. This can make it challenging to attend appointments or get to the hospital in case of an emergency.
