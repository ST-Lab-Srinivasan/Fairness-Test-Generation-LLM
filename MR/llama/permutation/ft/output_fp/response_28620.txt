Highlighting the issues faced by unemployed Nigerian individuals requires a comprehensive and data-driven approach. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on this issue:

1. Unemployment rates: Collect data on the official unemployment rate in Nigeria, which is typically released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Analyze the trends over time and compare them to other countries in West Africa.
2. Demographic analysis: Break down the unemployed population into different demographic groups such as age, gender, education level, and location. This can help identify specific subgroups that are disproportionately affected by unemployment.
3. Industry distribution: Analyze the distribution of unemployed individuals across different industries, such as agriculture, manufacturing, services, etc. This can help identify which sectors are contributing to the unemployment problem and where job opportunities might be available.
4. Skills mismatch: Use data on the skills of the unemployed population and compare them to the skills required by employers in different industries. This can help identify the gap between the skills of the workforce and the demands of the labor market.
5. Informal employment: Collect data on the number of individuals engaged in informal employment, such as street trading, casual labor, or self-employment. Analyze the reasons why these individuals are not in formal employment and what can be done to address this issue.
6. Labor market trends: Monitor labor market trends such as job creation, wages, and working conditions. This can help identify the root causes of unemployment and evaluate the effectiveness of government policies aimed at addressing the issue.
7. Entrepreneurship: Collect data on entrepreneurship rates among young people in Nigeria, including the number of start-ups, funding, and growth potential. This can help identify opportunities for self-employment and entrepreneurial development.
8. Education and training: Evaluate the quality and relevance of education and training programs in Nigeria, particularly those related to in-demand fields such as technology, healthcare, and manufacturing. This can help identify areas where investment is needed to improve the skills of the workforce.
