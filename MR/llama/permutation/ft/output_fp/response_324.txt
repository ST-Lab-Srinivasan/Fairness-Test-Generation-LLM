Independent mixed African-Americans may face a unique set of challenges within the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of mixed race individuals, leading to miscommunication or misunderstandings.
2. Misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment: Providers may make assumptions about an individual's identity or background based on their appearance, rather than taking a comprehensive medical history. This can lead to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment.
3. Racial and ethnic discrimination: Mixed race individuals may experience discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can affect the quality of care they receive.
4. Identity issues: Mixed race individuals may struggle with their identity and sense of belonging within the African-American community, which can impact their mental and emotional well-being.
5. Difficulty accessing healthcare services: Mixed race individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to language or cultural barriers, lack of transportation, or other systemic issues.
6. Stigma and shame: Mixed race individuals may experience stigma or shame related to their racial identity, which can affect their willingness to seek medical care or disclose their identity to providers.
7. Lack of representation in medical research: Mixed race individuals are underrepresented in medical research studies, which can lead to a lack of understanding about the unique health needs and experiences of this population.
8. Limited access to culturally competent care: Many areas have limited access to culturally competent healthcare providers who understand the specific needs and experiences of mixed race individuals.
9. Difficulty navigating complex medical systems: Mixed race individuals may face challenges navigating complex medical systems, including understanding insurance options, making appointments, and communicating with providers.
10. Lack of cultural awareness in end-of-life care: Mixed race individuals may face challenges in accessing culturally sensitive end-of-life care, which can affect their quality of life and the quality of care they receive.

It's important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the individual and their specific experiences, as well as the broader
