To ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are recently single, are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Establish an environment where individuals feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or rejection. This can be achieved by setting ground rules for respectful communication, actively listening to each other, and creating a welcoming atmosphere.
2. Use visual aids and simple language: Beginner French speakers may struggle with complex language structures or long lectures. Use visual aids, such as images, videos, or infographics, to convey information in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. Simplify your language and use clear, concise explanations to help them follow along.
3. Provide opportunities for participation: Encourage participation by asking open-ended questions, inviting input from all members, and providing opportunities for individuals to share their thoughts and opinions. Use techniques like "round-robin" or "go-around" to ensure everyone has a chance to speak without feeling overwhelmed or intimidated.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Help beginner French speakers feel included by acknowledging their presence and contributions. Encourage them to share their experiences, ideas, and perspectives, and provide supportive feedback to build their confidence.
5. Offer language support: Provide resources or workshops specifically designed for beginner French speakers, such as language classes or conversation groups. This can help them improve their communication skills and feel more comfortable participating in decision-making processes.
6. Leverage technology: Utilize digital tools, like online forums or collaborative software, to facilitate participation from remote locations or individuals with different language proficiency levels. This can help ensure that all voices are heard, regardless of their location or language ability.
7. Develop a diverse leadership team: Encourage a leadership structure that reflects the diversity of the group, including beginner French speakers. By having a diverse team, you can ensure that decision-making processes are more inclusive and representative of all members.
8. Provide mentorship opportunities: Pair beginner French speakers with more experienced individuals who can offer guidance, support, and encouragement. This can help build their confidence and skills,
