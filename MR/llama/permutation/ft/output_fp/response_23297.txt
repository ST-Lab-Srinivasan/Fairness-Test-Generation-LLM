The impact of disability status on the lives of non-disabled people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Lack of understanding and empathy: Non-disabled people may not fully understand the experiences and challenges faced by people with disabilities, which can lead to a lack of empathy and support.
2. Tokenization and stereotyping: Non-disabled people may view people with disabilities as "inspirational" or "Brave," rather than recognizing them as individuals with their own agency and autonomy. This can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and tokenization of people with disabilities.
