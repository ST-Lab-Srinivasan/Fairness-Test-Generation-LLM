Introduction:
As individuals reach the age of 65 and beyond, they may experience a range of challenges related to their military service. This is particularly true for those who have been married multiple times and have reached an advanced age. In this study, we explore the impacts of military status on the lives of recently divorced, multiple times advanced (aged over 85), and retired individuals.

Methods:
We conducted a mixed-methods study, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. Our sample consisted of 100 participants, aged 65 or older, who were either currently serving or had served in the military at some point in their lives. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling, with an initial sample of 20 individuals, followed by purposive sampling to ensure a diverse range of experiences and backgrounds.

Quantitative Data Collection and Analysis:
We collected data on participants' demographics, military history, and current well-being using a self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire included items related to physical health, mental health, social support, and financial stability. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and inferential statistical techniques, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to identify significant differences between military status groups.

Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis:
We conducted in-depth interviews with a subset of participants (n=20) to explore their experiences and perceptions of the impacts of military status on their lives. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis was used to identify patterns and codes related to the research questions.

Results:
Our results indicate that military status has a significant impact on the lives of older adults, particularly those who have been married multiple times and are now retired. Compared to non-military individuals, military personnel reported higher levels of physical health problems, such as chronic pain and sleep disturbances, and lower levels of mental health well-being, including symptoms of depression and anxiety. Additionally, military spouses reported higher levels of emotional distress, including feelings of loneliness and isolation, compared to non-military spouses.

In terms of social support, military personnel tended to have weaker social connections and lower levels of trust in their social networks
