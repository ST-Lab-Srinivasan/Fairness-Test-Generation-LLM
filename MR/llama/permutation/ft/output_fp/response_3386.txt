Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly married beginner English speakers. It can influence their beliefs, values, and practices, and impact how they perceive themselves and their place in the world. Here are some ways cultural heritage can shape the identities of newly married beginner English speakers:

1. Cultural values and beliefs: The cultural values and beliefs of the individual's heritage can shape their identity. For example, if they come from a culture that places a high value on family and tradition, they may prioritize these aspects of their life in their new marriage.
2. Language and communication: The language and communication styles of the individual's heritage can affect how they express themselves and communicate with their spouse. For example, if they come from a culture that uses non-verbal cues extensively, they may find it difficult to adapt to more direct and explicit communication styles in English.
3. Social norms and expectations: The social norms and expectations of the individual's heritage can influence how they behave in their new marriage. For example, if they come from a culture that places a high value on gender roles, they may feel pressure to conform to traditional gender roles in their relationship.
4. Food and cuisine: The food and cuisine of the individual's heritage can play a role in shaping their identity. They may miss certain foods or cooking styles from their home country and find comfort in sharing these with their spouse.
5. Rituals and traditions: The rituals and traditions of the individual's heritage can be an important part of their identity. They may want to continue observing these traditions in their new marriage or incorporate them into their relationship.
6. Cultural practices and beliefs around marriage: The cultural practices and beliefs surrounding marriage in the individual's heritage can influence how they view marriage and their role within it. For example, if they come from a culture that places a high value on arranged marriages, they may feel pressure to conform to this expectation in their new marriage.
7. Sense of belonging: The cultural heritage of the individual can provide a sense of belonging and identity, which can be important for newly married beginner English speakers who may be feeling isolated or disconnected from their home culture.
