Creating more inclusive housing policies for active-duty children can help ensure that they have access to safe and affordable housing, regardless of their military status. Here are some strategies that policymakers can consider:

1. Developing Military Housing Choice Programs: Offering a range of housing options, including on-base housing, off-base rentals, and homeownership programs, can help ensure that active-duty families have access to affordable and quality housing.
2. Increasing Funding for Military Housing Subsidies: Providing financial assistance to help active-duty families cover the cost of housing can help make housing more affordable and accessible. This can include increasing funding for military housing subsidies, such as the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and the Military Housing Assistance Program (MHAP).
3. Streamlining the Military Housing Process: Simplifying the process of finding and securing housing can help reduce stress and burden on active-duty families. This can involve creating online portals or mobile apps that provide information on available housing options, as well as offering support services to help families navigate the process.
4. Addressing Discrimination in Housing: Ensuring that active-duty families are not discriminated against when seeking housing can help ensure that they have access to fair and equal housing opportunities. This can involve implementing anti-discrimination policies and regulations, as well as providing education and training to landlords and real estate agents.
5. Encouraging Community Involvement: Building partnerships with local communities and organizations can help ensure that active-duty families have access to the resources and support they need. This can involve collaborating with community groups, non-profits, and other organizations to provide housing assistance, as well as promoting community involvement in housing initiatives.
6. Providing Financial Assistance for Home Repairs: Offering financial assistance for home repairs and renovations can help active-duty families maintain their homes and address any issues that may arise. This can involve providing grants or low-interest loans to cover the cost of repairs, as well as offering technical assistance and support to help families navigate the repair process.
