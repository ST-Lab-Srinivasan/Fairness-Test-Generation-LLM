As a divorce lawyer, I have seen firsthand the challenges that divorced individuals face in the job market. Here are some of the common issues that divorced civilian people may encounter:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being divorced, particularly if the divorce was multiple times. Some employers may view divorced individuals as unreliable or unstable, which can affect their hiring decisions.
2. Lack of confidence: Going through a divorce can be emotionally draining, and it's common for individuals to feel less confident in their abilities afterward. This lack of confidence can manifest in various ways, including during job interviews or when dealing with work-related situations.
3. Gaps in employment history: Depending on the length and circumstances of the divorce, there may be gaps in an individual's employment history. These gaps can raise red flags for potential employers, who may view them as a sign of instability or lack of commitment.
4. Difficulty with job searching: After a divorce, individuals may feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to proceed with their job search. They may struggle with creating a resume, networking, or even identifying their career goals.
5. Limited professional opportunities: Depending on the industry or field, there may be limited professional opportunities for divorced individuals, particularly if they have been out of the workforce for an extended period. This can make it challenging to find suitable employment, especially in competitive job markets.
6. Childcare and family responsibilities: Many divorced individuals have childcare and family responsibilities that can impact their ability to work certain hours or maintain a consistent schedule. While some employers may be understanding of these circumstances, others may view them as a liability.
7. Difficulty with job transitions: Divorce can lead to significant changes in one's personal and professional life. As a result, divorced individuals may struggle with transitioning to new roles or industries, particularly if they have become out of touch with their professional networks.
8. Limited access to resources: Depending on the circumstances of the divorce, some individuals may have limited access to resources such as education, training, or networking opportunities. This
