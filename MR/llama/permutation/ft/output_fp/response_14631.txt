Creating more inclusive public policies for physically able-bodied ethnically full Asian individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the intersectionalities of race, ability, and other factors. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all communities. Avoid using terms that stereotype or marginalize particular groups, such as the use of "Asian" as a singular term. Instead, use "Asian Americans" or "Asian Canadians," etc.
2. Representation matters: Ensure that decision-makers and leaders are diverse and representative of the communities they serve. This can be achieved through affirmative action policies, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and targeted recruitment efforts.
3. Accessibility: Make public spaces and facilities more accessible to people with disabilities. This can include installing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms, as well as providing accommodations for individuals with sensory or cognitive impairments.
4. Education and awareness: Provide training and education on disability awareness and inclusive practices for public servants, educators, and other stakeholders. This can help build a culture of inclusion and respect for people of all abilities.
5. Policy reforms: Review and reform policies that perpetuate ableism or discrimination against people with disabilities. For example, addressing the lack of accessibility in transportation systems, employment opportunities, and healthcare services.
6. Community engagement: Engage with Asian American communities to understand their unique needs and experiences. This can involve conducting outreach and consultations with community leaders, advocates, and individuals with disabilities.
7. Intersectionality: Recognize that ableism intersects with other forms of oppression, such as racism, sexism, and homophobia. Addressing these intersections is crucial for creating a truly inclusive society.
8. Economic empowerment: Advocate for policies that promote economic empowerment for Asian Americans with disabilities, such as job training programs, entrepreneurship support, and small business loans.
9. Healthcare accessibility: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and inclusive for people of all abilities
