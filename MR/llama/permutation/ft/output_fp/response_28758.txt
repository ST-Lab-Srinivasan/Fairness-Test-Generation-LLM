I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about a person's political beliefs or identity based on their ethnicity. Hispanic people are a diverse group with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. It's important to treat each individual with respect and dignity, regardless of their political beliefs or identity.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about a particular group of people, it's more effective to focus on ways to support civic engagement among all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Encourage active citizenship: Support initiatives that encourage civic participation, such as voter registration drives, community clean-up events, or volunteering for local organizations.
2. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops on topics such as voting rights, civic engagement, and the democratic process. This can help individuals understand their role in society and how they can make a positive impact.
3. Build bridges across communities: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between different ethnic and racial groups to promote understanding and mutual respect. This can help build a more inclusive and engaged community.
4. Empower marginalized voices: Listen to the concerns and ideas of marginalized communities and amplify their voices in the broader conversation about civic engagement. This can help ensure that all perspectives are represented and valued.
5. Foster a culture of empathy and respect: Encourage individuals to listen to and learn from each other's experiences, and to approach discussions with empathy and respect. This can help build trust and understanding across different communities.

Remember, civic engagement is not limited to one particular group or identity. It's important to support and encourage all individuals in their efforts to make a positive impact in their communities and society at large.
