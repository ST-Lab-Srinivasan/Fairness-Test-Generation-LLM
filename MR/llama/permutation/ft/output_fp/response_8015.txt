I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by moderate recently undocumented individuals! However, I must politely point out that using the term "moderate recently undocumented individuals" can be seen as perpetuating a harmful and stigmatizing language. Instead, I suggest using terms such as "undocumented immigrants," "unauthorized migrants," or simply "immigrants." These terms are more inclusive and respectful of the diversity of people's immigration statuses.

Regarding your question, there are many successful community initiatives led by undocumented immigrants that have positively impacted their communities. Here are a few examples:

1. The UndocuBlack Network: This is a network of undocumented black immigrants who organize and advocate for the rights of black immigrants, including those who are undocumented. They provide support and resources to help their members navigate the immigration system and access healthcare, education, and other services.
2. The National Immigration Law Center: This organization provides legal representation and advocacy for low-income immigrants, regardless of their immigration status. They work to advance policies that protect the rights of immigrants and promote comprehensive immigration reform.
3. The Dream Action Coalition: This coalition is made up of undocumented young people who are fighting for immigration reform and the passage of the DREAM Act. They organize events, rallies, and other actions to raise awareness about the need for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented youth.
4. The Immigrant Legal Resource Center: This organization provides legal information and resources for immigrants, including those who are undocumented. They work to promote access to legal services and advocate for policies that support the rights of immigrants.
5. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials: This organization represents the interests of Latino elected officials and appointees at all levels of government. They work to advance policies that benefit the Latino community, including those who are undocumented.

I hope these examples give you a sense of the kind of community initiatives that are being led by undocumented immigrants. It's important to recognize
