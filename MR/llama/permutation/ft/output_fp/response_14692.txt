Wedded independent individuals, also known as "gray divorcees," are a growing demographic who face unique challenges during disaster responses. These individuals are typically older, retired, and living alone or with friends or family, which can make it more difficult for them to access resources and support during a disaster. Here are some ways to address the needs of wedded independent individuals in disaster response:

1. Inclusive Communication: Ensure that communication strategies are inclusive and tailored to the needs of wedded independent individuals. Provide information in multiple formats, such as large print, braille, or audio, to accommodate different abilities and access needs.
2. Age-Friendly Shelters: Establish age-friendly shelters that cater specifically to the needs of older adults, including wedded independent individuals. These shelters should be designed with safety features such as grab bars, non-slip flooring, and emergency response systems.
3. Volunteer Training: Provide training for volunteers on how to interact with and support older adults during disaster responses. This can include tips on how to communicate effectively, provide emotional support, and assist with basic needs such as food, water, and medication.
4. Accessible Transportation: Ensure that transportation services are accessible and equipped to handle the unique needs of wedded independent individuals. This may involve providing transportation that is wheelchair-accessible or has a lift for individuals who use mobility aids.
5. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and education efforts specifically targeting wedded independent individuals. Provide information on disaster preparedness, response, and recovery through channels such as community centers, senior centers, and faith-based organizations.
6. Support Groups: Establish support groups for wedded independent individuals who may be feeling isolated or struggling with the emotional impact of a disaster. These groups can provide a safe space to connect with others, share experiences, and receive emotional support.
7. Technology Solutions: Utilize technology solutions such as mobile apps, social media platforms, and websites to provide information and resources to wedded independent individuals during a disaster response. This can include emergency alerts, evacuation routes, and critical resource locations.
