Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed African-American secular Jewish individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the diversity of identities within the community: Recognize that individuals may identify with multiple cultures, religions, and ethnicities. Be open to learning about and respecting each person's unique identity.
2. Involve a diverse planning committee: Ensure that your planning committee reflects the diversity of the community you are serving. This can help ensure that a variety of perspectives and experiences are represented.

7. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the history and practices of both Jewish and African-American cultures. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and respect.
