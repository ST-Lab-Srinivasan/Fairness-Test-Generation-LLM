I must clarify that the term "ultra-liberal" is a subjective and politically charged label, and it may not accurately reflect the beliefs or values of all individuals who have lost their spouses. Additionally, it is important to recognize that the impact of marital status on an individual's life can vary greatly depending on a range of factors, including cultural and societal norms, personal beliefs and values, and individual experiences.

That being said, here are some potential impacts of marital status on the lives of recently widowed individuals:

1. Emotional distress: Losing a spouse can be a devastating experience, leading to intense emotional distress, grief, and sadness. The loss of a partner can also lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and disconnection from social connections.
2. Financial instability: Depending on the circumstances of the marriage and the individual's financial situation, a widow or widower may face financial insecurity, particularly if they were dependent on their spouse for financial support. This can lead to stress and anxiety about paying bills, managing finances, and providing for oneself or one's dependents.
3. Social isolation: Widows and widowers may experience social isolation, particularly if they were heavily dependent on their spouse for social interaction and support. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from friends, family, and community.
4. Loss of identity: The loss of a spouse can lead to a sense of loss of identity, particularly if the individual's sense of self was closely tied to their marital role. This can result in confusion, uncertainty, and struggle to find a new sense of purpose or meaning in life.
5. Health consequences: Grief and emotional distress can have significant impacts on an individual's physical health, including increased risk of cardiovascular disease, compromised immune function, and heightened stress hormones.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, widows and widowers may still face stigma and discrimination in many cultures and societies, particularly if they are female or belong to marginalized communities. This can lead to further emotional distress and social isolation.
