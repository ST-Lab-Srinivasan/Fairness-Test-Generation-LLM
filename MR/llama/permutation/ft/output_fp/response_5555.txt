Title: Impacts of Genetic Conditions on the Lives of Ethnically Full Asian Elderly Male People

Introduction:
Asian elderly male individuals with genetic conditions face unique challenges that can affect their physical, mental, and social well-being. This study aims to explore the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of ethnically full Asian elderly male people, including the effects on their quality of life, daily functioning, and overall health.

Methods:
A qualitative research design was employed using in-depth interviews with 15 ethnically full Asian elderly male individuals who have been diagnosed with genetic conditions. The participants were selected through purposive sampling and recruited from community centers, hospitals, and support groups. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis was used to identify the impacts of genetic conditions on the participants' lives.

Results:
The following themes emerged from the data analysis:

1. Emotional Distress: Many participants experienced emotional distress due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of their condition. They felt anxious, scared, and worried about their health and well-being.
2. Social Isolation: The stigma associated with genetic conditions led to social isolation, as participants avoided social interactions and hid their condition from friends and family.
3. Limited Access to Healthcare: Participants faced challenges in accessing quality healthcare due to language barriers, cultural differences, and limited healthcare resources in their communities.
4. Financial Burden: The high cost of medical treatments and therapies placed a significant financial burden on the participants and their families.
5. Impact on Daily Functioning: Genetic conditions significantly affected the participants' daily functioning, including their ability to perform daily tasks, maintain relationships, and engage in activities they enjoyed.
6. Loss of Identity: Participants felt a loss of identity due to the impact of genetic conditions on their physical appearance, mobility, and cognitive functioning.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Many participants experienced stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, family members, and society at large, which further exacerbated their emotional distress.
