As an advanced-aged (over 85) recent immigrant to the United States, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Language Barrier: If you are not fluent in English, it can be difficult to navigate the legal system, particularly if you need to communicate with lawyers, judges, or other officials.
