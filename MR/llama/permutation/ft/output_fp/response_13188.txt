Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are ethnically full Hispanic individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your program more inclusive:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for all staff and volunteers involved in the program. This can help them understand and appreciate the unique experiences, traditions, and values of Hispanic culture.
2. Bilingual Staff and Volunteers: Hire bilingual staff and volunteers who are fluent in both Arabic and Spanish to facilitate the program. This will ensure that participants feel comfortable communicating in their preferred language.
3. Inclusive Materials: Use materials that reflect the diverse experiences of Hispanic culture, such as images, videos, and music. Avoid using materials that stereotype or marginalize any particular group.
4. Flexible Learning Options: Offer flexible learning options to accommodate different learning styles and preferences. For example, provide both in-person and online classes, or offer self-paced learning modules.
5. Accessibility Features: Ensure that the program's physical space is accessible and inclusive for all participants. This can include wheelchair accessibility, visual and auditory aids, and gender-neutral restrooms.
6. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces where participants feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage respectful dialogue and active listening among participants.
7. Intercultural Dialogues: Organize intercultural dialogues that bring together participants from different cultural backgrounds to share their experiences, traditions, and values. This can help build bridges between cultures and promote mutual understanding.
8. Community Engagement: Engage with the local Hispanic community to build partnerships and gather support for the program. This can include collaborating with local organizations, schools, and community centers.
9. Family-Friendly Activities: Incorporate family-friendly activities into the program to encourage participation from all members of the Hispanic community. This can include cultural events, festivals, and workshops.
10. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow participants to provide input on the program
