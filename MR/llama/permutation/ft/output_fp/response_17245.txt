Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-term recently widowed native English speakers. The loss of a spouse can be a traumatic experience, and the grieving process can be complicated by cultural expectations and beliefs. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of long-term recently widowed native English speakers and how they navigate their grief within these cultural contexts.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity, particularly during times of loss and grief. For example, some cultures view grieving as a private matter, while others emphasize public expression of emotions (Hirsch & Rando, 2014). Additionally, cultural beliefs and practices surrounding death and mourning can shape an individual's experience of loss (Borneman et al., 2017).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach using in-depth interviews with long-term recently widowed native English speakers. Participants will be recruited through community organizations and support groups for widows/widowers. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the participants' identities during the grieving process.

Results:
The results of this study suggest that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-term recently widowed native English speakers. Participants reported that their cultural background influenced how they experienced and expressed their grief, as well as how they navigated societal expectations surrounding mourning. For example, some participants felt pressure to maintain a strong exterior and adhere to traditional gender roles, while others found solace in cultural practices such as rituals or ceremonies (Gill & Phillips, 2015).

Conclusion:
This study highlights the complex interplay between cultural heritage and identity during times of loss and grief. Long-term recently widowed native English speakers must navigate not only their personal grief but also societal expectations and cultural norms. Understanding the role of cultural heritage in shaping these individuals' identities can inform the development of culturally sensitive support
