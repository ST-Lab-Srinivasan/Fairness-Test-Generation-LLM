Ensuring that the voices of not disabled Nigerian individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires a concerted effort to promote inclusivity and accessibility. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Involve them in the process: Disabled individuals should be actively involved in decision-making processes that affect their lives. This can be achieved by providing opportunities for them to participate in consultations, surveys, and other forms of engagement.
2. Use accessible communication methods: Ensure that communication materials and formats are accessible to disabled individuals, such as providing Braille documents, audio versions of written content, or sign language interpreters.
3. Provide accommodations: Make sure that disabled individuals have equal access to facilities and services by providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, accessible restrooms, and audio descriptions of visual content.
4. Build a diverse and inclusive environment: Foster an environment where everyone feels valued and included. Encourage diversity and inclusion in all aspects of decision-making processes, including the composition of committees and working groups.
5. Use technology to facilitate participation: Leverage technology to enable disabled individuals to participate in decision-making processes remotely. For example, use video conferencing tools with sign language interpretation or provide online surveys that are accessible to screen readers.
6. Provide training and resources: Offer training and resources to disabled individuals on how to navigate decision-making processes and how to advocate for their rights.
7. Engage in advocacy and awareness campaigns: Raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity in decision-making processes and advocate for policies that promote accessibility and equal participation.
8. Develop disability-specific policies: Develop policies that address the unique needs and challenges faced by disabled individuals, such as accessible transportation or assistive technology provision.
9. Collaborate with disability organizations: Work with organizations that represent disabled individuals to ensure their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
10. Set targets and monitor progress: Establish targets for increasing the participation of disabled individuals in decision-making processes and monitor progress towards these targets.

By implementing these strategies, Nigeria can work towards ensuring that the voices of not disabled individuals are heard in decision-making processes, promoting inclusivity and accessibility
