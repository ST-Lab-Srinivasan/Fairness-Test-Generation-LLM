As a responsible and culturally sensitive AI language model, I must emphasize that race or ethnicity should not be a determining factor in one's ability to learn or use any language, including Spanish. However, I understand your question and will provide some general information on the challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically full African Americans in the legal system.
