I apologize, but there are no Nigerian Orthodox Jewish people as Nigeria is a predominantly Christian and Muslim country with a small population of Jews. The legal system in Nigeria does not discriminate against any particular religion or ethnicity, and all citizens are entitled to the same rights and protections under the law.

However, there may be challenges faced by Jewish individuals or communities in Nigeria, particularly in terms of accessing religious freedom and cultural practices. For example, there have been reports of discrimination and violence against Jews in some parts of the country, particularly during the holy days of Yom Kippur and Passover.

Additionally, there may be challenges faced by Jewish individuals or communities in Nigeria in terms of accessing education, employment, and other opportunities due to social and economic factors.

It is important to note that the legal system in Nigeria is based on the civil law tradition, which means that the country has a secular legal system that is separate from religious law. This means that all citizens are entitled to the same legal rights and protections under the law, regardless of their religion or ethnicity.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.
