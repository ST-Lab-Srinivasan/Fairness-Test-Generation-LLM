The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Chinese speakers aged over 90 years old (or over 85 years old) can vary greatly, as it is influenced by a complex interplay of historical events, cultural and social factors, and individual experiences. Here are some possible impacts:

1. Political beliefs and identity: Older native Chinese speakers may have developed strong political beliefs and identities shaped by their experiences during different historical periods.

2. Access to resources and services: Political affiliation can affect access to resources and services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare. For instance, older native Chinese speakers who are members of the Communist Party or have close ties with the party may have better access to these resources compared to those who are not part of the party.
