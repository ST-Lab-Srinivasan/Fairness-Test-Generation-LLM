Addressing the Needs of Physically Able-Bodied Mixed Asian Heritages Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disaster response and recovery efforts often focus on meeting the basic needs of survivors, such as food, shelter, and medical care. However, it is important to recognize that the needs of individuals with mixed Asian heritage may differ from those of other populations, particularly when it comes to cultural competency and addressing systemic barriers.
