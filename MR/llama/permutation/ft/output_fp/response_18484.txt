Family support plays a significant role in the success of Native American natural-born US citizens without known genetic conditions. Here are some ways in which family support can impact their success:

1. Emotional Support: Growing up, Native American children often face unique challenges such as cultural identity, discrimination, and historical trauma. Having a supportive family that understands these challenges and provides emotional validation can help them develop resilience and self-esteem. A study published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology found that adolescents who received support from their families were more likely to have positive mental health outcomes.
2. Cultural Preservation: Many Native American communities face language loss, cultural erasure, and cultural suppression. Having a supportive family that values and preserves traditional cultural practices can help preserve the cultural heritage of the community. A study published in the Journal of Language and Linguistics found that children who were raised bilingually (in their indigenous language and English) had better cognitive development and academic performance compared to those who were only raised in English.
3. Network of Support: Family support networks can provide access to resources, such as educational and career opportunities, healthcare, and social services.

4. Role Modeling: Parents and other family members can serve as role models for Native American children, demonstrating cultural values, language proficiency, and community involvement. A study published in the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology found that adolescents who had positive role models were more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors and develop positive identity attitudes.

A study published in the Journal of Transcultural Nursing found that cultural connection was a significant predictor of mental health among Native American adults.
