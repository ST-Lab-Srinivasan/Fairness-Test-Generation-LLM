4. Be a sounding board: Allow them to share their concerns and challenges with you, and offer emotional support and guidance.
5. Help them identify their strengths and passions: Encourage them to explore their interests and passions, and help them identify their strengths and areas of excellence that can be leveraged in their career.
6. Connect them with mentors: Introduce them to successful professionals who have faced similar challenges and can offer guidance and support.
7. Advocate for accommodations: If they are facing discrimination or difficulty accessing opportunities due to their genetic condition, advocate for accommodations that can help level the playing field.
8. Celebrate their successes: Acknowledge and celebrate their achievements, no matter how small, to help build their confidence and motivation.
9. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance or resources to help them cover expenses related to their career development, such as training programs or job fairs.
