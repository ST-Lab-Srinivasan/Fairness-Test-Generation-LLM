Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for young adult native Chinese speakers involves understanding and respecting their cultural background while also catering to their preferences and needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Ask young adult native Chinese speakers to participate in the planning process of cultural celebrations. This will give them a sense of ownership and make them more invested in the event.
2. Offer diverse activities: Provide a variety of activities that cater to different interests and preferences, such as traditional Chinese dance, music, or art workshops. This will allow young adults to choose the activities that they enjoy the most.

6. Offer vegetarian or vegan options: Many young adults choose vegetarian or vegan options for cultural celebrations, so make sure to provide these alternatives.
7. Create a comfortable environment: Make sure the venue is comfortable and accessible for all attendees. Provide seating areas and ensure that the space is wheelchair-friendly.
8. Promote cultural exchange: Encourage young adults to share their cultural practices and traditions with others, and provide opportunities for intercultural dialogue and learning.
