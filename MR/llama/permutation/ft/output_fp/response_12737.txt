Lower middle-income permanent residents may face a range of challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Access to care: Lower middle-income individuals may struggle to access quality healthcare due to financial constraints or lack of insurance coverage. They may have to rely on public hospitals or clinics, which may have limited resources and longer wait times.

6. Discrimination: Lower middle-income individuals from marginalized communities may face discrimination in the healthcare system, which can lead to mistrust and decreased access to care.
7. Limited provider choice: Lower middle-income individuals may have limited choices when it comes to healthcare providers, as they may not be able to afford specialist care or may have limited access to certain types of providers.
8. Long wait times: Lower middle-income individuals may face longer wait times for appointments and procedures due to staffing shortages or limited resources in the healthcare system.

10. Limited access to preventive care: Lower middle-income individuals may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations, which can lead to poorer health outcomes in the long
