Creating more inclusive community programs for natural-born US citizen recently divorced individuals requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Conduct a needs assessment: Reach out to the local divorce community, social service agencies, and other stakeholders to identify the specific needs and challenges faced by recently divorced individuals in your area. This will help you design programs that address their unique requirements.
2. Offer support groups: Facilitate regular support groups where recently divorced individuals can share their experiences, receive emotional support, and connect with others who understand their situation. These groups could be held online or in-person, and led by trained facilitators who are experienced in working with divorcees.
3. Provide legal aid: Offer free or low-cost legal services to help recently divorced individuals navigate the complexities of divorce law, including property division, child custody, and spousal support. Partner with local law firms or legal aid organizations to provide this service.
