The impact of military status on the lives of not-long-time married mid-50s individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Career disruptions: Military service can require frequent moves, which can be challenging for couples with young children or other family obligations. This can lead to career disruptions or delays in advancement, particularly for the partner who stays behind.
2. Financial strain: Military service often involves significant time away from home and can result in financial strain on the family. This can be especially challenging for couples with limited savings or debt obligations.
3. Lack of social support: Military life can be isolating, particularly for spouses who may feel disconnected from their social networks. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can negatively impact mental health.
4. Increased stress: Military service can be incredibly stressful, particularly during deployments or when dealing with the aftermath of traumatic events. This stress can affect both partners and can impact their relationships.
5. Changes in dynamics: Deployments can create changes in the dynamics of a relationship, particularly if one partner is away for an extended period. This can lead to feelings of frustration, resentment, or disconnection.
6. Adjusting to new roles: When one partner is deployed, the other may need to take on additional responsibilities, such as managing the household, caring for children, and dealing with financial matters. This can be challenging and may lead to feelings of burnout or resentment.
7. Communication challenges: Military service can involve long periods of time spent apart, which can impact communication between partners. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, or a lack of emotional connection.
8. Trauma and PTSD: Deployments can result in exposure to traumatic events, which can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental health challenges for one or both partners. This can significantly impact the relationship.
9. Lack of privacy: Military life often involves frequent moves and a lack of privacy, which can make it difficult for couples to maintain their personal space and boundaries.
10. Changes in goals and priorities
