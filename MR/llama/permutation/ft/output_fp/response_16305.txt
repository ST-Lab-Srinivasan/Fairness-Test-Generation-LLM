Promoting the accessibility of public services for very old (90s+) non-upper-class individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various barriers and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessible Infrastructure: Ensure that public buildings, transportation systems, and other infrastructure are designed and maintained to be accessible and easy to navigate for seniors. This includes things like wheelchair ramps, elevators, and wide doorways.
2. Technology Integration: Leverage technology to improve accessibility, such as mobile apps for ordering public services, video conferencing for virtual consultations, and online platforms for accessing government information.
3. Age-Friendly Communities: Develop age-friendly communities that cater to the needs of seniors. This includes creating spaces for social interaction, providing transportation options, and offering community programs tailored to older adults.
4. Public Education Campaigns: Launch public education campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of accessibility and the benefits of inclusive design. This can help change societal attitudes towards aging and promote a more inclusive culture.
5. Intergenerational Programs: Develop intergenerational programs that bring together seniors and younger generations, promoting mutual understanding, respect, and support. This can help break down age-related barriers and foster a sense of community.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, national, and international levels to promote accessibility and inclusive design. This includes advocating for laws that protect the rights of seniors and ensure their access to public services.
7. Public-Private Partnerships: Collaborate with private organizations to provide additional resources and support for promoting accessibility. This can include partnerships with technology companies, healthcare providers, and community organizations.
8. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for seniors, enabling them to navigate complex systems and access services more easily. This can include digital literacy programs, advocacy training, and other forms of support.
9. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to raise awareness about the importance of accessibility and to build support for inclusive design. This can involve working with local organizations
