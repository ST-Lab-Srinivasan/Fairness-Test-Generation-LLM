The impact of military status on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers can vary depending on their individual circumstances and the specific context they find themselves in. However, some common effects of being a non-liberal individual in China's military system include:

1. Limited personal freedom: As a member of the military, individuals may be subject to strict rules and regulations that limit their personal freedom. This can include restrictions on travel, communication, and association with family and friends outside of the military.
2. Mandatory service: In China, military service is mandatory for all citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations. Non-liberal individuals may be required to serve in the military for a certain period of time, which can have significant impacts on their personal and professional lives.
3. Potential for ideological indoctrination: The Chinese military has been criticized for promoting a particular ideology that aligns with the ruling Communist Party's views. Non-liberal individuals may be subject to indoctrination or propaganda efforts aimed at shaping their beliefs and attitudes in line with the party's goals.
4. Limited career opportunities: Depending on their political beliefs, non-liberal individuals may face limitations on their career advancement within the military. This can be particularly challenging for those who are unable to advance due to their political views, which can lead to feelings of frustration and disillusionment.
5. Social stigma: In some cases, non-liberal individuals may face social stigma or discrimination from fellow military members or society at large. This can be particularly challenging for those who are unable to express their political views openly due to fear of reprisal or persecution.
6. Psychological impacts: The experience of being a non-liberal individual in the Chinese military can have significant psychological impacts, including feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression. This can be exacerbated by the strict military discipline and the potential for political reprisals against those who do not conform to the ruling party's ideology.
7. Limited access to education and resources: Non-liberal individuals may have limited access to educational and resource opportunities within the military, which can impact their career advancement and overall well-being.
