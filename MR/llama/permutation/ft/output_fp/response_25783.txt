Creating more inclusive social policies for employed, not widowed for a long time individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this demographic. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Recognize the value of care work: Care work, including childcare, elder care, and household management, is often undervalued and unpaid.
