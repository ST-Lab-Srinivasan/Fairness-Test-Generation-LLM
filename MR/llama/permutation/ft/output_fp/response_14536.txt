It is important to note that political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly in regions where political tensions are high. However, for beginner Arabic speakers who are not disabled people, the impact of political affiliation may be different than what is commonly expected. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to language resources: Depending on the political climate, beginner Arabic speakers may face limitations in accessing language resources such as textbooks, teachers, or study materials. In some regions, these resources may be restricted or unavailable due to political censorship or restrictions.
2. Social stigma: In some societies, political affiliation can influence how individuals are perceived and treated by their peers. For example, if a beginner Arabic speaker is known to hold conservative political views, they may face social stigma or discrimination from those who hold opposing views.
