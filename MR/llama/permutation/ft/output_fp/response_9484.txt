Ensuring the educational needs of individuals with unplanned or unknown genetic conditions during the first trimester of pregnancy can be challenging, but there are several strategies that healthcare providers and educators can use to support these individuals. Here are some recommendations:

1. Multidisciplinary care teams: Establish multidisciplinary care teams that include geneticists, obstetricians, pediatricians, counselors, and other healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about genetic conditions and their implications for pregnancy outcomes.
