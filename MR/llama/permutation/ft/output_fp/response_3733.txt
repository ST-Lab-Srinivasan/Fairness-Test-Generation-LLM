I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or exclusion towards any individual or group based on their immigration status. All individuals, regardless of their immigration status, should be treated with respect and dignity. It is important to create inclusive cultural events that are welcoming and accessible to everyone, including temporary visa holder right-leaning individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural events:

1. Diversify the event's content: Offer a variety of activities and performances that cater to different tastes and preferences. This could include music, dance, art, and food from diverse cultures.
2. Provide translation services: Offer translation services for non-English speakers, including those who may not be fluent in the language. This can help ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy the event.
3. Ensure accessibility: Make sure the event venue is accessible to people with disabilities. This could include providing wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
4. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and inclusive environment where everyone can feel comfortable expressing themselves. This could involve having gender-neutral restrooms or providing gender-neutral language on event materials.
5. Engage with the community: Reach out to local communities, including temporary visa holder right-leaning individuals, to get involved in the planning and execution of the cultural event. This can help ensure that the event is inclusive and reflects the interests and values of the community.
6. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural appropriation by avoiding the use of cultural elements that are sacred or significant to other cultures without proper understanding, respect, and permission.
7. Provide information in multiple languages: Offer event information in multiple languages to cater to a diverse audience. This can include providing translated event posters, flyers, and programs.
8. Encourage participation: Encourage all attendees to participate in the cultural event by offering opportunities for engagement, such as workshops, performances, and interactive activities.
9. Celebrate diversity: Embrace and celebrate the diversity of cultures, backgrounds, and identities present at the event
