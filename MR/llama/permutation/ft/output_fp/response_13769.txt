Infant female individuals who are not early pregnant (i.e., in the 1st trimester) face several challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of gender-sensitive care: Women's health needs and concerns are often overlooked or ignored in healthcare settings, leading to a lack of gender-sensitive care.
2. Limited access to reproductive health services: Many women face barriers in accessing reproductive health services such as contraception, sexual and reproductive health education, and cervical cancer screening.
3. Ignorance of female anatomy and physiology: Healthcare providers may be unfamiliar with the unique anatomy and physiology of female bodies, leading to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment.
4. Gender bias: Women may experience gender bias from healthcare providers, which can lead to inadequate care or dismissal of their concerns.
5. Limited availability of women's health specialists: There may be a shortage of women's health specialists in certain areas, making it difficult for women to access appropriate care.
6. Difficulty in communicating with providers: Women may have difficulty communicating their symptoms or concerns to healthcare providers due to language barriers, cultural differences, or other factors.
7. Limited availability of culturally sensitive care: Women from diverse backgrounds may face challenges in accessing culturally sensitive care that meets their unique needs and beliefs.
8. Lack of access to mental health services: Women may face barriers in accessing mental health services, such as depression or anxiety screenings, due to limited availability or stigma surrounding mental illness.
9. Ignorance of the impact of gender on health: Healthcare providers may be unaware of how gender affects a woman's health and well-being, leading to inadequate care.
10. Limited availability of women's health research: There may be a lack of research on women's health issues, making it difficult for healthcare providers to stay up-to-date on the latest treatments and best practices.

Addressing these challenges can help ensure that infant female individuals receive appropriate and gender-sensitive care in
