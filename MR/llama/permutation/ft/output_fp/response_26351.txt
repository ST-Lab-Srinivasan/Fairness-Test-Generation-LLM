As a beginner Chinese speaker, there may be several challenges faced by bereaved people in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers is the language barrier. Many jobs require proficiency in both spoken and written Chinese, which can be difficult for those who are not native speakers or have limited experience.

5. Stereotyping and discrimination: Unfortunately, beginner Chinese speakers may face stereotyping and discrimination based on their language proficiency level. Some employers may assume that they are not capable of doing certain jobs or may have preconceived notions about their abilities.
6. Difficulty in finding job opportunities: Beginner Chinese speakers may find it challenging to find job opportunities, especially if they do not have any prior experience or connections in China. This can be due to a lack of knowledge about the job market or limited access to job listings and resources.
7. Difficulty in adapting to work culture: Beginner Chinese speakers may struggle to adapt to the cultural norms and expectations of the workplace, particularly if they are not familiar with the corporate culture in China.
8. Limited networking opportunities: As a beginner Chinese speaker, it can be challenging to connect with other professionals and build a network in China, which can limit job opportunities and professional growth.
