I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about individuals based on their immigration status. Every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's worth, value, or potential contributions to society.

It is also important to acknowledge that immigration policies and laws can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals and families, particularly those who are undocumented or in a mixed-status family. These individuals may face barriers to accessing basic needs such as healthcare, education, and employment, which can have long-term consequences for their well-being and opportunities.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their immigration status, it is important to recognize the complexity and diversity of experiences among immigrant populations. It is also crucial to advocate for policies and laws that promote inclusivity, respect, and dignity for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
