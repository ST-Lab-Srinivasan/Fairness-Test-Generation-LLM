Creating more inclusive housing policies for late pregnancy (third trimester) widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive housing policies:

1. Accommodate pregnant women's needs: Ensure that housing policies take into account the physical and emotional changes that occur during pregnancy. Provide accommodations such as extra space for stretching, comfortable seating areas, and accessible washrooms to make the living environment more comfortable for pregnant women.
2. Offer flexible lease terms: Allow pregnant women to have flexible lease terms, such as shorter leases or temporary breaks in rent payments, to accommodate their changing circumstances during pregnancy.
3. Provide prenatal and postnatal care: Offer on-site or nearby access to prenatal and postnatal care services, including midwife or obstetrician appointments, to ensure that pregnant women receive the necessary medical attention during their pregnancy.
4. Support breastfeeding: Provide a comfortable and private space for breastfeeding mothers to express milk, such as a dedicated lactation room or access to a quiet area in the common spaces.
5. Address emotional support: Recognize that widowed individuals may be experiencing emotional challenges during pregnancy and provide resources for emotional support, such as counseling services or peer support groups.
6. Ensure accessibility: Make sure that the housing complex is accessible to pregnant women with mobility issues, including wheelchair accessibility and elevators for those who may need them.
7. Offer parenting classes: Provide workshops or classes on parenting techniques and resources to help expectant mothers prepare for the arrival of their baby.
8. Encourage community building: Create opportunities for residents to connect with each other, such as potluck dinners or playgroups, to foster a sense of community and support among pregnant women.
9. Provide resources for postnatal care: Offer resources such as baby-sitting services, breastfeeding consultations, and pediatric services to help new mothers navigate the challenges of caring for a newborn.
