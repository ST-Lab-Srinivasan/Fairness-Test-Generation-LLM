Creating more inclusive social policies for recent immigrants to the US as strong atheists can be achieved by considering their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Advocate for legal protections: Recognize that discrimination against immigrants, including those who identify as atheist or non-religious, is a significant barrier to social inclusion. Advocate for legal protections that promote equality and nondiscrimination, such as the Freedom From Religion Foundation's "Church and State" initiative.
2. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources specifically tailored to recent immigrants who may have difficulty navigating linguistic barriers in their new environment. This can help bridge the gap between the immigrant community and mainstream society.
3. Create culturally sensitive mental health services: Develop mental health services that are culturally sensitive and accessible to atheist or non-religious individuals. This may involve training mental health professionals on cultural competency issues, providing alternative forms of support (e.g., therapy groups specifically for immigrants), or offering virtual resources for those who face barriers to in-person services.
4. Foster community connections: Encourage the development of inclusive community spaces where atheist or non-religious individuals can connect with others from similar backgrounds. This could involve organizing events, creating online forums, or establishing mentorship programs that pair recent immigrants with established members of the community.
5. Address systemic barriers: Identify and challenge systemic barriers that hinder the social integration of atheist or non-religious immigrants, such as discriminatory employment practices or lack of access to education and healthcare. Advocate for policies that promote equity and inclusion within these systems.
6. Develop educational resources: Create educational resources that address the unique needs and experiences of recent immigrant atheists, including information on legal rights, cultural competency, and mental health support. Disseminate these resources through community centers, schools, or other accessible platforms.
7. Advocate for representation: Encourage the representation of atheist or non-religious individuals in decision-making processes, such as through advocacy groups or community leadership positions
