Regarding the challenges faced by recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who identify as Native American or Indigenous, there are several barriers they may encounter in the healthcare system. These include:

1. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained to understand and address the unique needs and experiences of Indigenous communities, leading to misunderstandings or inappropriate care.
2. Language barriers: Many Indigenous communities have their own languages and dialects, and healthcare providers may not be fluent in these languages, making communication difficult.
3. Access to care: Indigenous populations may face challenges in accessing healthcare services due to geographic isolation, lack of transportation, or other logistical barriers.
4. Health disparities: Indigenous communities often experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and respiratory problems, due to a combination of factors including historical trauma, poor living conditions, and limited access to healthy food and recreational spaces.
5. Lack of trust: Historical abuses and traumas within the healthcare system, such as the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study, have led to a lack of trust among Indigenous communities towards medical professionals and the healthcare system as a whole.
6. Limited availability of culturally competent providers: Indigenous populations may face challenges in finding healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about their cultural practices and beliefs, leading to feelings of disconnection and mistrust.
7. Lack of representation in healthcare decision-making: Indigenous communities may have limited representation in healthcare policy-making and decision-making processes, which can result in policies that do not adequately address their needs.
8. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to intergenerational trauma
