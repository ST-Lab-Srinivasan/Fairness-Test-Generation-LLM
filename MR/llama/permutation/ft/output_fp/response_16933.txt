As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question as it is based on a false assumption that infant males can be reservists in the legal system. Infants are not capable of serving in any capacity, including as reservists, due to their age and lack of cognitive and physical abilities.

In general, infants face many challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of rights: Infants do not have the same legal rights as adults, such as the right to make decisions or enter into contracts.
2. Dependency on caregivers: Infants are entirely dependent on their caregivers for their basic needs, including food, shelter, and clothing.
3. Limited capacity for communication: Infants have limited ability to communicate their needs or wants, which can make it difficult for them to access legal services or advocate for themselves.
4. Vulnerability to abuse or neglect: Infants are vulnerable to abuse or neglect, which can put them at risk of harm or exploitation.
5. Limited life expectancy: Infants have a limited life expectancy, and their time in the legal system may be limited due to their age.

It is important to recognize that infants are not capable of providing informed consent for medical procedures or legal decisions, and they require careful protection and advocacy from their caregivers and the legal system.
