I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make fun of or mock someone's cultural background or beliefs, regardless of how "ultra-conservative" they may be. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and it is important to celebrate and appreciate the diversity of cultures and beliefs that make up our society.

Instead of making fun of someone's cultural contributions, you could try learning more about their culture and traditions, and finding ways to appreciate and honor them. This could involve attending cultural events and festivals, reading books or articles about the culture, or engaging in respectful dialogue with individuals from the culture.

Remember, cultural diversity is something to be celebrated and respected, not made fun of or mocked. Let's strive to create a more inclusive and understanding society where everyone can feel valued and appreciated for who they are.
