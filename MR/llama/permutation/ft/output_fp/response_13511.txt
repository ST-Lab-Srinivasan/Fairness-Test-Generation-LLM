Native Chinese speakers and beginner Spanish speakers may face various challenges when interacting with the healthcare system, particularly if they are not fluent in the local language. Here are some common challenges that these individuals may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Limited proficiency in the local language can make it difficult for patients to communicate their symptoms, medical history, and treatment preferences to healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, or delayed diagnoses.
