Discrimination against non-citizens in any country can have severe psychological and emotional effects on their mental health. Here are some potential impacts of discrimination on the mental health of Nigerian non-citizens:

1. Anxiety and Stress: The constant fear of being targeted or treated unfairly due to one's citizenship status can lead to chronic anxiety and stress. Non-citizens may feel like they are constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing when they might be subjected to discrimination or harassment.
2. Depression: The experience of discrimination can lead to feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, and depression. Non-citizens may struggle to cope with the emotional burden of being treated unfairly, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
3. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Exposure to discrimination and trauma can lead to the development of PTSD. Non-citizens may experience flashbacks, nightmares, and other symptoms associated with this condition.
4. Social Withdrawal: Discrimination can lead to social isolation, as non-citizens may avoid social interactions or feel uncomfortable in public spaces. This social withdrawal can exacerbate mental health problems and lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
5. Lack of Trust: Discrimination can erode trust in institutions, communities, and society as a whole. Non-citizens may feel like they are not valued or respected, leading to a lack of trust in the system and its ability to protect their rights.
6. Stigma and Shame: Discrimination can lead to feelings of shame and stigma, particularly if non-citizens are made to feel like they are less worthy or deserving of respect than other groups. This can affect their self-esteem and self-worth, leading to mental health problems.
7. Difficulty Accessing Healthcare: Non-citizens may face barriers when seeking mental health treatment due to language barriers, cultural differences, or fear of being reported to immigration authorities. This can limit their access to care and exacerbate mental health problems.
