Creating more inclusive cultural events for individuals in their first trimester of pregnancy, who may be experiencing physical limitations or discomfort during this time, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for everyone:

1. Offer flexible seating options: Provide comfortable seating options that can accommodate different body types and needs, such as cushioned chairs with back support or adjustable tables for those who need them.
2. Modify event layout: Consider the physical limitations of individuals in their first trimester and design the event space accordingly. For example, provide clear paths and navigation to avoid congested areas, and ensure that there is enough space for attendees to move around comfortably.

9. Ensure accessibility features: Make sure that any necessary accessibility features, such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, or Braille signage
