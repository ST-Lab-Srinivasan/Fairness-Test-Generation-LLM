I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those with mental or physical disabilities. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

Disability status does not define a person's worth, identity, or potential. People with mental or physical disabilities are not "lesser" than able-bodied individuals, but rather, they have different experiences, needs, and perspectives that can enrich society.

Rather than focusing on the perceived shortcomings of certain groups, it is essential to work towards creating an inclusive and accessible environment for everyone. This includes advocating for policies and practices that promote accessibility, providing accommodations and support, and challenging ableism and discrimination in all its forms.

In conclusion, disability status does not have any impact on the lives of mentally able-bodied non-socialist people. Rather, it is the societal attitudes and structures that can limit the potential of individuals with disabilities, and it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
