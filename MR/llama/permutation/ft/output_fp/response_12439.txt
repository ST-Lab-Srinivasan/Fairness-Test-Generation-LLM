Ensuring the educational needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique cultural, linguistic, and socio-economic backgrounds. Here are some strategies that schools and educators can adopt to meet the educational needs of these students:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for teachers and staff on the cultural norms, values, and beliefs of Native American communities. This can help them understand the students' backgrounds and needs better and provide a more inclusive learning environment.
2. Language Support: Many Native American communities have their own languages and dialects. Provide language support services, such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual education programs, to ensure that these students can communicate effectively with teachers and peers.
3. Socio-Emotional Support: Native American recent immigrants may face unique challenges related to cultural adjustment, discrimination, and identity formation. Provide socio-emotional support services, such as counseling or mentoring programs, to help them navigate these challenges.
4. Academic Accommodations: Provide academic accommodations, such as extra time to complete assignments or one-on-one tutoring, to help Native American recent immigrants who may face challenges in the classroom due to language barriers or cultural differences.
5. Curriculum Development: Develop culturally responsive curricula that incorporate Native American history, culture, and perspectives. This can help students feel more connected to their heritage and better understand the context of the content being taught.
6. Community Engagement: Engage with local Native American communities through partnerships, collaborations, or cultural events. This can help build relationships between schools and communities and provide opportunities for students to learn about their heritage and culture.
7. Family Involvement: Encourage family involvement in the educational process by providing information in the student's native language, holding parent-teacher conferences in the local language, or offering cultural events for families.
8. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Native American students with peers or mentors from their own communities. This can provide a sense of belonging and support for students who may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers
