2. Job creation and economic opportunities: Invest in job creation programs, small businesses, and community development initiatives to provide economic opportunities for marginalized communities.
3. Wealth inequality reduction: Implement policies that address wealth inequality, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing options, and social safety nets.

9. Building inclusive economies: Develop and promote economic models that prioritize equity, diversity, and inclusion, such as cooperative ownership structures,
