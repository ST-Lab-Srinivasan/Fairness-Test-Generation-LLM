Supporting the economic empowerment of unemployed Native natural-born US citizen individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Job training and placement programs: Provide job training and placement services specifically tailored to the needs of Native Americans. These programs should focus on developing skills in high-demand industries, such as healthcare, technology, and renewable energy.
2. Small business support: Offer resources and support for Native American entrepreneurs to start and grow their own businesses. This can include access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Apprenticeships and vocational training: Provide apprenticeship and vocational training programs in fields such as construction, manufacturing, and transportation. These programs can help individuals gain the skills and experience needed to compete in the job market.
4. Education and workforce development: Invest in education and workforce development programs that provide Native Americans with access to quality education and job training opportunities. This can include partnerships with tribal colleges and universities, as well as initiatives to increase the number of Native American students pursuing higher education.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent Native Americans from accessing economic opportunities. This can include working to remove obstacles such as discrimination, lack of access to transportation, and inadequate infrastructure.
6. Community development: Invest in community development programs that promote economic growth and stability in Native American communities. This can include initiatives to support local businesses, create jobs, and improve living standards.
7. Policy reform: Advocate for policy reforms at the federal, state, and local levels that address the unique needs and challenges faced by Native Americans. This can include policies to promote tribal sovereignty, increase access to healthcare and education, and support economic development in Native American communities.
8. Collaboration with tribal governments: Work closely with tribal governments to develop and implement economic empowerment strategies that are tailored to the specific needs of their communities. This can include providing technical assistance, training, and resources to help tribes build their own economic development programs.
