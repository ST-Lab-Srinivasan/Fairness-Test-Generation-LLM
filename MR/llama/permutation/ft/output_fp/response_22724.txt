Introduction:
As the global population ages, there is a growing number of older adults who are experiencing the challenges of military service in their later years. This study aims to investigate the impact of military status on the lives of recently divorced individuals aged 65 and above, who have just exited the military.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that military service can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. The positive impacts include increased self-esteem, discipline, and sense of purpose, while the negative impacts include exposure to trauma, stress, and health problems (Koenen et al., 2015). However, there is limited research on the specific impact of military status on recently divorced older adults.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 100 recently divorced individuals aged 65 and above who have just exited the military. Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, and focus groups.

Quantitative Data Collection:
A survey questionnaire will be developed to collect demographic information, military history, and psychological factors such as stress levels and well-being. The survey will also assess the impact of military status on various aspects of life, including social relationships, financial stability, and mental health.

Qualitative Data Collection:
Semistructured interviews and focus groups will be conducted to gather in-depth qualitative data on the experiences and perceptions of recently divorced older adults who have just exited the military. The interviews and focus groups will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Data Analysis:
The survey data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistical methods such as t-tests and ANOVA to identify significant differences in psychological factors and life outcomes between military veterans and non-veterans. The qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Expected Findings:
The study is expected to reveal both positive and negative impacts of military status on the lives of recently divorced older adults. Specifically, it is expected that military veterans will experience higher levels of
