Creating more inclusive social policies for agnostic, actively partially identifying as non-binary individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and discrimination faced by this community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and respect identity: Recognize that non-binary identities are valid and important. Use language and terminology that is inclusive and respectful, such as "actively partially identifying as non-binary" instead of binary terms like "male" or "female."
2. Inclusive policies: Develop policies that are inclusive of non-binary individuals, such as allowing them to identify themselves without being forced into a binary gender category. For example, allow individuals to mark "non-binary" or "genderqueer" on official forms and identification documents.
3. Access to healthcare: Ensure that non-binary individuals have access to affirming healthcare, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries. This can involve providing coverage for these procedures through insurance plans or offering financial assistance programs.
4. Education and awareness: Educate the public about non-binary identities and the challenges faced by this community. This can involve creating resources and educational materials that are inclusive of non-binary individuals, as well as hosting workshops and events to raise awareness and promote understanding.
5. Legal recognition: Advocate for legal recognition of non-binary identities, including the right to use preferred pronouns and names on official documents such as driver's licenses and passports. This can involve working with government agencies and advocacy groups to push for policy changes at the local, state, or national level.
6. Community support: Create safe spaces and support networks for non-binary individuals, including online communities and in-person events. These spaces can provide a sense of belonging and validation for individuals who may feel marginalized or isolated due to their identity.
7. Anti-discrimination policies: Develop anti-discrimination policies that specifically address the needs and concerns of non-binary individuals, including protections against discrimination in employment, housing, and education.
8. Representation in media: Advocate for more diverse and inclusive representation of non-binary identities in media, including television shows,
