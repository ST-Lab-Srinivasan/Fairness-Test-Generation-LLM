Highlighting the issues faced by beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers can be done through various data-driven methods. Here are some approaches:

1. Language proficiency assessments: Conduct surveys or language assessments to evaluate the proficiency levels of both beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers. This will give you an idea of their strengths, weaknesses, and areas that need improvement.
2. Sentiment analysis: Analyze online reviews, social media posts, and other forms of user-generated content to understand the opinions and sentiments of both groups towards each other's language proficiency. This can help identify any biases or misconceptions.
3. Language learning behavior analysis: Study how both groups approach language learning, including their preferred methods, resources, and motivations. This can help identify any differences in learning behaviors and preferences.
4. Socio-demographic analysis: Analyze the socio-demographic characteristics of both groups, such as age, gender, education level, and occupation. This can help identify any patterns or trends in language proficiency based on these factors.
5. Language usage data: Collect data on how both groups use their respective languages in everyday situations, such as conversations, written communication, and media consumption. This can help identify any differences in language usage patterns.
6. Corpus analysis: Analyze large datasets of texts to identify patterns and trends in language use, such as grammar, vocabulary, and discourse markers. This can help identify any differences in language use between beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers.
7. Case studies: Conduct case studies of individual learners or groups of learners to gain a deeper understanding of their language learning experiences, challenges, and strategies. This can help identify any common issues faced by both groups.
8. Survey experiments: Design surveys or experiments to test the effectiveness of different language learning methods or resources for both beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers. This can help identify which methods are most effective for each group.
9. Comparative linguistics: Analyze the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary of both languages to identify any differences or similarities. This can help identify any challenges faced by learners in acquiring one language versus the other.
