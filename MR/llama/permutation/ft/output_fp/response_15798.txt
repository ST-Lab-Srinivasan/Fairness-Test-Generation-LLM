Creating more inclusive cultural programs for monastic Buddhist non-upper-class individuals involves understanding their unique needs and challenges, as well as developing strategies to address them. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to their voices: Create opportunities for monastic Buddhist non-upper-class individuals to share their perspectives, experiences, and concerns. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews. By listening to their voices, you can gain a deeper understanding of their needs and create programs that are more responsive to their cultural context.
2. Provide accessible programming: Ensure that your cultural programs are accessible to monastic Buddhist non-upper-class individuals by offering flexible scheduling options, affordable pricing, and locations that are easily accessible. For example, you could offer programs at times when they may not have access to transportation or in areas with limited public transportation options.
3. Cultivate diverse representation: Ensure that your cultural programs reflect the diversity of monastic Buddhist non-upper-class individuals by including representatives from different backgrounds and experiences. This can help create a more inclusive environment and ensure that the perspectives of all individuals are taken into account.
4. Offer financial assistance: Many monastic Buddhist non-upper-class individuals may face financial barriers to participating in cultural programs. Consider offering scholarships or other forms of financial assistance to help make your programs more accessible.
5. Build partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve monastic Buddhist non-upper-class individuals, such as community centers or non-profits, to reach a wider audience and create more inclusive programming. This can help leverage resources and expertise to create more impactful cultural programs.
6. Prioritize language accessibility: Many monastic Buddhist non-upper-class individuals may have limited English proficiency, which can be a barrier to participating in cultural programs. Consider providing interpretation or translation services, or creating bilingual or multilingual programming to make your programs more accessible.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for monastic Buddhist non-upper-class individuals of different ages to connect and learn from one another. This can help build a sense of community and foster intergenerational understanding
