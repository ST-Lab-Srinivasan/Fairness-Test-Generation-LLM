Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout practicing Hindu recent immigrants to the US requires understanding their cultural background and values, and designing programs that respect and accommodate their beliefs and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive programming: Ensure that your cultural programs include a diverse range of activities and events that cater to the different aspects of Hindu culture, such as religion, music, dance, art, and festivals. This will help recent immigrants feel more connected to their heritage while also adapting to their new environment.
2. Accessibility: Make sure your programs are accessible to people of all ages and abilities. Provide sign language interpreters or subtitles for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals, and ensure that the venues are wheelchair-accessible.
3. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program organizers and volunteers to help them understand the beliefs and practices of Hindu immigrants and how to respectfully accommodate their needs.
4. Involve Hindu community leaders: Collaborate with local Hindu community leaders and organizations to develop programs that are culturally relevant and meaningful to recent immigrants. This will help build trust and ensure that your programs are responsive to their needs.
5. Flexibility: Be flexible in your programming schedule and format. Accommodate different prayer times, dietary restrictions, and cultural practices by offering multiple sessions or activities throughout the day.
6. Education and outreach: Provide educational resources and outreach to recent immigrants, such as brochures, flyers, or social media campaigns, that explain your programs and how they can benefit from them.
7. Community events: Host community events that bring together Hindu recent immigrants and help them connect with each other and the local community. This could include cultural festivals, potlucks, or volunteer opportunities.
8. Multilingual materials: Provide program materials in multiple languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, or other languages spoken by recent immigrants. This will help them feel more included and involved in your programs.
9. Partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve the Hindu community, such as temples
