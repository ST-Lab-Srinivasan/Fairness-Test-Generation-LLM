Ensuring the healthcare needs of recent immigrants to Canada, particularly those from upper upper-middle-income countries, can be a complex task. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Healthcare Services: Recent immigrants may face challenges accessing healthcare services due to language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of knowledge about the healthcare system in Canada. Providing interpretation and translation services, as well as cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers, can help overcome these barriers.

Health Promotion and Disease Prevention: Recent immigrants may be at higher risk for chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease due to the lack of access to preventive care in their home countries. Providing culturally sensitive health promotion and disease prevention programs can help address these risks.
