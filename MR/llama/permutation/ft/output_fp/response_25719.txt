As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that the term "deeply lower-class" is not a recognized societal or economic category, and it may be perceived as offensive or discriminatory. It is important to recognize that people from diverse backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses can face challenges in accessing legal services and navigating the legal system.

Here are some of the common challenges faced by Arabic speakers who may be from lower-income communities or marginalized groups:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Many people in these communities may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or even basic information about their rights and responsibilities under the law.
2. Language barriers: Arabic is a widely spoken language, but it may not be the dominant language in many countries where the legal system operates. This can create language barriers for Arabic speakers who may have difficulty understanding or communicating with legal professionals who are not fluent in their language.
3. Cultural and religious differences: Arabic culture and religion have unique customs, practices, and beliefs that may not be well understood by legal professionals who are not familiar with these cultural nuances. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can negatively impact the legal process.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against marginalized communities, including those from lower-income backgrounds, is still prevalent in many societies. Arabic speakers may face discrimination or bias from legal professionals, which can further complicate their access to justice.
5. Lack of trust: Many people from marginalized communities may have difficulty trusting the legal system, due to historical or ongoing experiences of oppression, discrimination, or violence. This lack of trust can make it challenging for Arabic speakers to seek legal aid or access legal services.
6. Limited financial resources: Legal services can be expensive, and many people from lower-income backgrounds may struggle to afford legal representation or access to legal aid organizations.
7. Limited knowledge of the legal system: Many Arabic speakers may have limited knowledge of their rights and responsibilities under the law, as well as the legal processes involved in navigating the justice system.
