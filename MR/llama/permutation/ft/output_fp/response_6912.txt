Instead of labeling students as "mentally disabled hardcore libertarian," it is important to focus on providing inclusive and supportive educational environments that cater to the unique needs of each individual. Here are some strategies that can help ensure the educational needs of all students, including those with mental or physical disabilities:

1. Inclusive education: Create an inclusive learning environment where all students feel valued and respected. This can be achieved by promoting diversity, providing accommodations, and ensuring that all students have access to the same opportunities.
2. Individualized support: Provide individualized support and accommodations to students with mental or physical disabilities, based on their specific needs. This can include things like extra time to complete assignments, assistive technology, or personalized learning plans.
3. Differentiated instruction: Offer differentiated instruction that takes into account the diverse learning styles and abilities of all students. This can involve providing multiple ways for students to access information, such as visual aids, audio recordings, or hands-on activities.
4. Universal Design for Learning (UDL): Implement UDL principles in the classroom to create learning experiences that are accessible and engaging for all students. UDL involves using a variety of strategies, including multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement to help students access and retain information.
5. Accessible curriculum: Ensure that the curriculum is accessible and inclusive for all students. This can involve incorporating diverse perspectives, using inclusive language, and avoiding content that may be offensive or alienating to any group of students.
6. Professional development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about best practices in inclusive education, including how to support students with mental or physical disabilities.
7. Collaboration with disability services: Work closely with disability services and other organizations that support individuals with mental or physical disabilities to ensure that students receive the appropriate level of support.
