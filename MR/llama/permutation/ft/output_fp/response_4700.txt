Title: Exploring the Intersectionality of Cultural Heritage and Identity for Mixed African-American Indians

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identity and experiences of individuals, especially those belonging to mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds. As a mixed African-American Indian, navigating cultural heritage can be complex, as one's identity is influenced by multiple factors.
