Mexican citizens aged 90 or older face a range of challenges within the country's healthcare system. Here are some of the key challenges they encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Many elderly Mexicans live in rural areas, where healthcare facilities and specialized care may be scarce or unavailable. Even in urban areas, there can be a shortage of healthcare providers with experience treating older adults.
2. High out-of-pocket expenses: Many Mexican citizens, including the elderly, struggle to afford medical care due to high out-of-pocket costs. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems.
3. Limited availability of geriatric care: Geriatric care is a relatively new field in Mexico, and there may be limited access to specialized care for older adults, particularly outside of major cities.
4. Language barriers: Older adults who do not speak Spanish may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
5. Transportation difficulties: Many elderly Mexicans lack access to reliable transportation, making it difficult for them to travel to healthcare appointments or receive care in a timely manner.
6. Cultural barriers: Older adults may face cultural barriers when accessing healthcare services, such as stigma associated with aging or a lack of trust in the healthcare system.
7. Limited social support: Older adults may experience social isolation, which can impact their mental and physical health. They may also face challenges accessing home care or other forms of support.
8. Discrimination: Older adults may face discrimination based on their age, particularly in areas such as employment, housing, and access to services.
9. Limited education and awareness: Many older adults may not have access to healthcare education or information, which can lead to a lack of understanding about their health conditions or the services available to them.
10. Poverty: Some elderly Mexicans live in poverty, which can impact their ability to access healthcare services or afford necessary medications.
