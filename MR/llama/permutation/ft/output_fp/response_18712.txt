Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent immigrant to India, mixed Asian heritage people. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes their experiences:

1. Identity formation: For many mixed Asian heritage individuals, their cultural heritage serves as a source of identity and belonging. It helps them understand where they come from, how they fit into the larger Asian diaspora, and how they relate to different cultures and communities.
2. Cultural practices and traditions: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may adopt cultural practices and traditions from their ancestral cultures, such as foodways, festivals, music, and art. These cultural elements serve as a connection to their heritage and help them maintain cultural continuity across generations.
3. Language: Many mixed Asian heritage individuals may speak multiple languages, including their ancestral language(s) and the dominant language of the country they reside in. Language serves as a vital link to their cultural heritage, enabling them to communicate with family members and communities from different parts of Asia.
4. Cultural exchange: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may facilitate cultural exchange between their ancestral culture and the broader Indian society. They may introduce their peers to traditional practices, foods, or festivals from their ancestral cultures, fostering cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
5. Challenges and discrimination: Unfortunately, mixed Asian heritage individuals may also face challenges and discrimination based on their cultural background. They may encounter questions about their identity, be subject to stereotypes or racism, or experience microaggressions in their daily lives. In such cases, their cultural heritage can provide a sense of resilience and strength in the face of adversity.
6. Community building: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may form communities with others who share similar cultural backgrounds. These communities can serve as safe spaces for individuals to connect with their heritage, find support, and engage in collective identity formation.
7. Preservation and transmission: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may feel a sense of responsibility to preserve and transmit their cultural heritage to future generations. They may pass on traditional practices, language, and stories to their children or younger relatives, ensuring the continuation of their ancestral cultures.
