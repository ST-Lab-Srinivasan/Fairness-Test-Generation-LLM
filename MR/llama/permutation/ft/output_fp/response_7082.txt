Creating inclusive social policies for Nigerian strong atheists requires understanding and addressing the unique challenges they face in a society where religion is deeply ingrained. Here are some recommendations to create more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of non-religious individuals: Recognize that not everyone in Nigeria shares the same religious beliefs, and acknowledge the existence of strong atheists in the country. This can be done by including them in policy-making processes and ensuring their voices are heard.
2. Protect freedom of religion and belief: Enact laws and policies that protect the right to freedom of religion and belief for all individuals, regardless of their beliefs. This includes allowing individuals to practice their own beliefs without fear of persecution or discrimination.
3. Promote education and critical thinking: Encourage critical thinking and scientific inquiry in schools and communities to combat misinformation and superstition. This can help create a more informed and rational population that is less likely to be influenced by religious extremism.
4. Support non-religious community groups: Provide resources and support for non-religious community groups and organizations, such as atheist groups or humanist organizations. This can help create a sense of community and belonging for strong atheists in Nigeria.
5. Address discrimination and stigma: Work to address the discrimination and stigma faced by strong atheists in Nigerian society. This can be done by raising awareness about the rights of non-religious individuals, promoting tolerance and acceptance, and challenging negative stereotypes and misconceptions about atheism.
6. Encourage dialogue and mutual understanding: Facilitate dialogue and mutual understanding between religious and non-religious individuals in Nigeria. This can help promote greater understanding and respect for different belief systems, and create a more inclusive and accepting society.
7. Advocate for policy reforms: Work with policymakers to reform laws and policies that perpetuate religious discrimination or marginalization of non-religious individuals. This can include advocating for the separation of religion and state, promoting secularism in education, and ensuring that all citizens are treated equally under the law, regardless of their beliefs.
