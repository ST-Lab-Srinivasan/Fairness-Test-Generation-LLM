I must clarify that the term "devout Muslim extreme moderate liberal" is an oxymoron, as Islam is a religion that values modesty and humility, and extremism is not in line with the teachings of Islam. It is important to approach individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their beliefs or practices.

That being said, here are some suggestions on how to promote accessibility for individuals who identify as Muslim:

1. Provide accessible facilities: Ensure that public facilities, such as mosques, praying areas, and community centers, are accessible to individuals with disabilities. This can be achieved by installing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
2. Offer accommodations for prayer: Provide designated areas for individuals to perform their daily prayers, such as a separate room or a designated area within a larger public space. This can help ensure that individuals have a quiet and comfortable place to pray without feeling excluded.
3. Train staff on cultural sensitivity: Ensure that public service providers are trained on cultural sensitivities and how to interact with Muslim individuals. This can help reduce misunderstandings and promote inclusivity.
4. Promote diversity and inclusion: Encourage diversity and inclusion in all aspects of public life, such as in hiring practices, community outreach programs, and decision-making processes. This can help create a more welcoming environment for individuals from diverse backgrounds.
5. Provide halal food options: Ensure that public institutions provide halal food options for Muslim individuals, particularly during religious events or when serving large groups of people.
6. Offer language support: Provide interpretation services or translated materials to help ensure that Muslim individuals can access public services in their preferred language.
7. Create a support network: Establish a support network of individuals who can provide guidance and support to Muslim individuals, particularly during times of need or hardship.
8. Foster interfaith dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and collaboration between different religious groups to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can help build bridges between communities and promote inclusivity.
9. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops on Islamic beliefs and practices, as well as provide access to relevant reading materials and online resources.
