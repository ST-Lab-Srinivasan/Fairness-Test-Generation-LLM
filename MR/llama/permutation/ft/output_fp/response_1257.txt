Supporting the social inclusion of older adults, including those who were born in Canada and have recently turned 65, is crucial for their overall well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Encourage intergenerational connections: Older adults can benefit from connecting with younger generations through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, or simply spending time together. This can help break down age-related stereotypes and build bridges between different age groups.
