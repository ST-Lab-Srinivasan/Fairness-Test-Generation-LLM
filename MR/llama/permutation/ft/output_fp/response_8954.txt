Advocating for the rights of older workers, or "mature" workers, as they are often referred to, can be a complex and multifaceted issue. Here are some effective ways to advocate for their rights:

3. Encourage lifelong learning and skill development: Older workers may need to upskill or reskill to remain competitive in the job market. Advocate for programs that provide opportunities for lifelong learning and skill development, such as online courses, certification programs, or vocational training.
4. Address age-related stereotypes: Challenge age-related stereotypes and biases by highlighting the many examples of successful older workers who are contributing to their respective industries.
