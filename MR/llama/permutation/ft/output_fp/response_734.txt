Binary not widowed individuals, also known as those who have lost a partner through death or divorce and identify as bisexual, gay, lesbian, queer, or any other sexual orientation, often face unique challenges when it comes to mental health. Here are some ways to support the mental health of binary not widowed people for a long time:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Binary not widowed individuals may experience a range of emotions, including grief, sadness, anger, and isolation. It's essential to create a safe space where they can express their feelings without judgment. Listen actively, validate their emotions, and offer empathy.
2. Encourage self-care: Support them in practicing self-care activities that help manage stress, anxiety, or depression. Suggest relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. Encourage regular exercise, proper sleep hygiene, and healthy eating habits.
3. Provide social support: Binary not widowed individuals may feel isolated or disconnected from their social network. Encourage them to connect with LGBTQ+ friends, family, or support groups. Suggest activities that promote socializing, such as attending Pride events, joining a book club, or participating in volunteer work.
4. Help them find meaningful activities: Encourage binary not widowed individuals to engage in hobbies, creative pursuits, or other activities that bring them joy and purpose. This can help them maintain a sense of identity and fulfillment outside of their relationship.
5. Avoid clichés and stereotypes: Be mindful of stereotypes and clichés that perpetuate harmful attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals. Avoid making assumptions or using language that can be hurtful or alienating.
6. Educate yourself: Learn about the unique challenges faced by binary not widowed individuals, including discrimination, stigma, and mental health disparities. This will help you better understand their experiences and provide more effective support.
7. Advocate for inclusive policies: Support policies that promote equality and inclusion, such as anti-discrimination laws, access to healthcare, and LGBTQ+-inclusive education.
