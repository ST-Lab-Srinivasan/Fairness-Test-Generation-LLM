Native Arabic speaker children may face several challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: Limited proficiency in the dominant language of the healthcare system (usually English) can hinder communication between the child and healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of medical instructions or diagnoses.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultural backgrounds and values may lead to variations in health beliefs and practices, which can create challenges in providing appropriate care. For example, some Arab cultures may have different attitudes towards touching or physical examination, or may place a greater emphasis on traditional healing methods.
