6. Academic support: Offer academic support services, such as tutoring or study groups, to help students who may be struggling academically due to their personal circumstances.
7. Encourage self-care: Encourage students to prioritize self-care and stress management techniques, such as exercise, meditation, or mindfulness practices, to help them cope with the challenges of school and life.
8. Create a safe space: Create a safe and supportive learning environment where students can share their experiences and feelings without fear of judgment or stigma.
9. Encourage communication: Encourage students to communicate openly and honestly about their experiences and needs, and provide ongoing support and feedback to help them succeed academically.
