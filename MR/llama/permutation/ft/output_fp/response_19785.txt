Creating more inclusive public policies for mentally disabled ethnically full Asian individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Inclusive language and terminology: Avoid using language that is stigmatizing or offensive, such as "mentally disabled" or "handicapped." Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive, such as "people with mental health conditions" or "individuals with disabilities."
2. Cultural competence training: Provide training for professionals working with people from diverse backgrounds to help them understand the cultural nuances of mental health issues in different ethnic communities. This can include understanding the role of culture in mental health, the impact of cultural beliefs and practices on mental health, and how to provide culturally competent care.
3. Accessible services: Ensure that mental health services are accessible and culturally sensitive to the needs of ethnically full Asian individuals. This can include providing translation services, interpreters, and cultural brokers who can help bridge the gap between service providers and clients from diverse backgrounds.
4. Community outreach and engagement: Engage with ethnically full Asian communities through outreach and engagement activities to raise awareness about mental health issues and reduce stigma around seeking help. This can include partnering with community organizations, hosting cultural events, and using social media to reach a wider audience.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policy changes that promote inclusivity and address the unique needs of ethnically full Asian individuals. This can include pushing for more funding for mental health services in diverse communities, advocating for culturally sensitive policies and practices, and working with community leaders to raise awareness about mental health issues.
6. Building partnerships: Foster partnerships between service providers, community organizations, and ethnically full Asian individuals to co-design and deliver mental health services that are tailored to the needs of this community. This can help ensure that services are culturally sensitive and responsive to the unique challenges faced by ethnically full Asian individuals.
7. Addressing intersectionality: Recognize that ethnically full Asian individuals may face intersecting forms of discrimination,
