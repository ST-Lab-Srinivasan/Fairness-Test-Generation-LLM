I apologize, but the term "mentally able-bodied" is not a medically recognized or acceptable term. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their mental health status.

Regarding the impacts of immigration status on the lives of people, it can have significant effects on various aspects of their lives, including:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to fear of deportation or lack of documentation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can exacerbate health problems.
2. Employment and Financial Stability: Immigration status can affect an individual's ability to work legally, which can impact their financial stability and independence. Undocumented immigrants may be more vulnerable to poverty and economic insecurity.
3. Education: Immigration status can influence access to education for children of undocumented immigrants. They may face challenges in enrolling in schools or obtaining financial aid due to their immigration status.
4. Housing and Living Conditions: Undocumented immigrants may struggle to find affordable and stable housing, leading to overcrowding or poor living conditions.
5. Social Isolationation: Immigration status can lead to social isolation, as undocumented immigrants may avoid seeking help or support due to fear of deportation or stigma.
6. Mental Health: The stress and uncertainty associated with immigration status can negatively impact mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues.
7. Access to Public Benefits: Immigration status can affect an individual's access to public benefits such as food stamps, Medicaid, or unemployment insurance. Undocumented immigrants may be ineligible for these services.
8. Criminalization and Detention: Undocumented immigrants may be at risk of criminalization and detention, which can lead to further marginalization and stigma.
9. Family Separation: Immigration status can result in family separation, as undocumented immigrants may be deported or separated from their U.S.-citizen spouses or children.
