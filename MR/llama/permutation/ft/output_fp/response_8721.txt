Creating more inclusive public policies for active-duty temporary visa holder individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this population. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Improve Access to Healthcare: Active-duty temporary visa holders often face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. Policymakers can work towards expanding Medicaid coverage or creating a special enrollment period for these individuals to ensure they receive necessary medical care.
2. Address Language Barriers: Temporary visa holders may face language barriers that hinder their ability to navigate government services and benefits. Policymakers can provide interpretation services, develop multilingual materials, or offer language classes specifically designed for this population.
3. Simplify the Benefits Application Process: The application process for benefits and services should be user-friendly and accessible to all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. Policymakers can streamline the application process by simplifying forms and reducing the amount of required documentation.
4. Provide Access to Financial Assistance: Temporary visa holders may struggle to cover basic living expenses due to their immigration status. Policymakers can establish financial assistance programs, such as emergency funds or microloans, specifically designed for this population.
5. Offer Legal Resources and Support: Access to legal resources and support is crucial for temporary visa holders who may face difficulties navigating the immigration system. Policymakers can provide funding for legal clinics or partnerships with organizations that offer free or low-cost legal services.
6. Promote Community Engagement and Inclusion: Temporary visa holders are often isolated from mainstream society due to their immigration status. Policymakers can work towards promoting community engagement and inclusion by hosting cultural events, providing language classes, or creating opportunities for socialization and networking.
7. Advocate for Immigration Reform: Addressing the root cause of temporary visa holder status can help alleviate some of the challenges faced by this population. Policymakers can advocate for comprehensive immigration reform that provides a clear pathway to legal permanent residence or citizenship for individuals in this category.
