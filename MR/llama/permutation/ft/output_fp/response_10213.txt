This can include reading materials, workshops, and guest speakers that represent a range of identities and experiences.
5. Foster a sense of community: Encourage students to connect with one another and build a supportive community through group activities, clubs, and organizations that promote diversity and inclusivity.
6. Provide accommodations: Work with students to identify and address any accommodations they may need to succeed in their studies, such as flexible scheduling, additional time to complete assignments, or the use of gender-neutral language in course materials.
