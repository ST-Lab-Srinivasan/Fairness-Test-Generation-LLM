Discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental health of native French speaker permanent residents in several ways:

1. Internalized oppression: When individuals experience discrimination, they may internalize the negative messages and beliefs about their group, leading to feelings of shame, self-loathing, and low self-esteem. This can result in a lowered sense of self-worth and self-confidence.
2. Anxiety and stress: Discrimination can create an environment of constant stress and anxiety, as individuals may feel unsafe or uncomfortable in their surroundings. This chronic stress can lead to anxiety disorders, depression, and other mental health issues.
3. Social isolation: Native French speaker permanent residents may avoid social situations or feel excluded from social activities due to discrimination. Social isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and decreased mental well-being.

Lack of representation and voice: Discrimination can limit the opportunities and resources available to native French speaker permanent residents, making it difficult for them to express themselves or have their voices heard. This lack of representation can lead to feelings of powerlessness and disconnection from society.
5. Intergenerational trauma: The effects of discrimination can be passed down through generations, causing intergenerational trauma that can manifest in mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.
6. Stigma and marginalization: Discrimination can lead to a sense of stigma and marginalization, which can further erode mental health and well-being. The constant experience of being judged or rejected based on one's group identity can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

Difficulty accessing mental health services: Native French speaker permanent residents may face barriers when trying to access mental health services, such as language barriers, cultural insensitivity, or lack of knowledge about available resources. This can exacerbate existing mental health issues and create additional stressors.
8. Increased risk of substance abuse: Discrimination can lead to increased stress and feelings of hopelessness, which can increase the risk of substance abuse and addiction. Native
