1. Immersive Learning Environments: Create an immersive learning environment where beginners can practice speaking and listening to Arabic in a comfortable and supportive setting. This could involve organizing conversation groups, language exchanges, or even hosting cultural events where attendees can practice their Arabic skills.
2. Gamification: Incorporate game-like elements into the learning process to make it more enjoyable and engaging. For example, you could create a points system for completing tasks or activities related to the language, or organize friendly competitions among learners.
