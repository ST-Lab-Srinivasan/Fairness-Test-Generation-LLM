As a not just above poverty line immigrant natural-born US citizen, I have faced several challenges in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the main ones:

1. Language barriers: Many immigrants, including myself, face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and a lack of access to proper care.
2. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The US healthcare system often lacks cultural sensitivity towards immigrant communities. Providers may not be familiar with the specific healthcare needs and practices of different cultures, leading to inadequate care.
3. Limited access to specialists: As an immigrant, I have faced challenges accessing specialized care due to limited availability or lack of knowledge about available resources. This can result in delayed diagnosis or treatment for serious conditions.
4. High out-of-pocket costs: Many immigrants face high out-of-pocket costs for healthcare services, including coinsurance, deductibles, and copays. This can be a significant burden, especially for those living on a tight budget.
5. Lack of insurance coverage: Some immigrants may not have access to health insurance, either due to lack of availability or unaffordable premiums. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate existing health conditions.
6. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against immigrants still exist in the US, including in the healthcare system. Immigrants may face discrimination when seeking care, leading to a lack of trust in the system and delayed or foregone care.
7. Complex eligibility rules: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has complex eligibility rules for immigrants, including those with temporary protected status (TPS) or deferred enforced departure (DED). Navigating these rules can be challenging and may result in delays or missed opportunities for care.
8. Limited access to mental health services: Immigrants may face barriers accessing mental health services due to cultural stigma, language barriers, or limited availability of providers who are familiar with their specific needs.
