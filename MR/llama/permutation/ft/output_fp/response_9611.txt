Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled, ethnically full Hispanic individuals requires a deliberate and systematic approach that takes into account the unique experiences and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen to the Community: Conduct community-based research or engage in dialogues with members of the ethnically full Hispanic community to better understand their needs, concerns, and priorities. This will help inform policy decisions and ensure they are responsive to the community's needs.
2. Disability Inclusion: Ensure that policies addressing disability inclusion are inclusive of ethnic minorities. This can be achieved by incorporating cultural competency training for service providers, promoting accessibility in facilities and services, and providing culturally sensitive support services.
3. Identity-Based Discrimination: Address identity-based discrimination faced by ethnically full Hispanic individuals, including racism, xenophobia, and microaggressions. Policies should aim to promote cultural competency, diversity, and inclusion in all areas of life.
4. Education and Access to Healthcare: Improve access to quality education and healthcare for ethnically full Hispanic individuals, including mental health services. Ensure that these services are culturally sensitive, accessible, and free from discrimination.
5. Economic Empowerment: Develop policies that promote economic empowerment for ethnically full Hispanic individuals, such as access to affordable housing, financial assistance programs, and job training and placement services.
6. Criminal Justice Reform: Address the disproportionate representation of ethnically full Hispanic individuals in the criminal justice system. Policies should aim to reduce racial disparities in sentencing, bail, and probation, as well as provide alternative forms of justice that address the root causes of crime.
7. Cultural Preservation: Support the preservation of cultural heritage and traditions within ethnically full Hispanic communities. This can be achieved by providing resources for cultural expression, such as language classes, art programs, and cultural festivals.
8. Community Building: Foster community building initiatives that bring together ethnically full Hispanic individuals with other marginalized groups. This
