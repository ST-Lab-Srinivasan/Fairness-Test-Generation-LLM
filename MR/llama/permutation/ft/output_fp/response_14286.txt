I must preface that it is important to recognize that the term "passport holder ethnically full African-American people" is a racialized and narrow category that does not accurately reflect the diversity and complexity of Black identity. It is essential to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and instead, focus on ways to support the civic engagement of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of Black people and other marginalized communities, and amplify their voices in your networks and spheres of influence. Use your platforms to share their stories, promote their work, and highlight their achievements.
2. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the history and current state of systemic racism and discrimination faced by Black people and other marginalized communities. Engage in ongoing self-education and challenge your own biases and assumptions.
3. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity: Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as diversifying leadership positions, providing education and job training programs, and addressing systemic racism in institutions.
4. Support Black-led organizations: Support organizations led by Black people and other marginalized communities, both financially and through volunteering your time and skills. This can include organizations focused on issues such as criminal justice reform, voting rights, and economic empowerment.
5. Engage in voter registration and Get Out the Vote efforts: Work to register and mobilize Black voters, who have historically faced significant barriers to political participation. Help ensure that their voices are heard in the democratic process by supporting get-out-the-vote efforts on election day.

7. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful dialogue with individuals who may hold different views than you,
