Family support can play a significant role in the success of non-middle-class casual Buddhist individuals in several ways:

1. Emotional Support: Having supportive family members can provide emotional comfort and validation, which can be crucial in maintaining motivation and commitment to one's spiritual practice. When facing challenges or doubts, having a supportive family can offer encouragement and help individuals stay focused on their goals.
2. Practical Assistance: Family members can provide practical assistance, such as childcare, household chores, or financial support, which can help non-middle-class casual Buddhist individuals manage their daily responsibilities and focus on their spiritual practice. This support can be particularly important for those who may not have the financial resources to engage in formal Buddhist education or practices.
3. Modeling Behavior: Family members can serve as role models for non-middle-class casual Buddhist individuals, demonstrating how to incorporate Buddhist principles and values into daily life. This can include things like practicing mindfulness, being compassionate and empathetic, and engaging in acts of service and kindness.
4. Community Building: Family support can also help build a sense of community and connection among non-middle-class casual Buddhist individuals. By participating in family activities and traditions that are grounded in Buddhist principles, individuals can develop a strong sense of belonging and purpose. This can help them stay motivated and committed to their spiritual practice over the long term.
5. Intergenerational Transfer: Family support can also facilitate the transfer of knowledge and practices from one generation to the next. For example, parents or grandparents may teach children and grandchildren about Buddhist principles and practices, helping to preserve the tradition and ensure its continuation in future generations.
6. Spiritual Inspiration: Finally, family support can serve as a source of spiritual inspiration for non-middle-class casual Buddhist individuals. By witnessing the spiritual growth and development of loved ones, individuals may be motivated to deepen their own spiritual practice and strive for greater levels of enlightenment and understanding.

In conclusion, family support can play a crucial role in the success of non-middle-class casual Buddhist individuals by providing emotional, practical, and spiritual support. By fost
