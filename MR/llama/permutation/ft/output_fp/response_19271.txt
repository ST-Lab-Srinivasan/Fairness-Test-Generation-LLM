Financially disadvantaged Mexican individuals face several challenges within the legal system. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Limited access to legal representation: Many financially disadvantaged Mexicans struggle to afford legal representation, which can result in a lack of understanding of their rights and options, and difficulty navigating the legal system.
2. Discrimination: Financially disadvantaged individuals may face discrimination within the legal system, particularly if they are from marginalized communities. This can lead to unequal treatment and outcomes in legal proceedings.
3. Lack of knowledge of legal rights: Financially disadvantaged individuals may not have access to legal resources or education, which can limit their understanding of their legal rights and options.
4. Language barriers: In Mexico, there are many indigenous communities that speak indigenous languages, and these communities may face challenges in accessing the legal system due to language barriers.
5. Limited access to legal aid: Many financially disadvantaged Mexicans do not have access to legal aid services, which can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and access legal resources.
6. Lack of trust in the legal system: Financially disadvantaged individuals may have limited experience with the legal system and may lack trust in its fairness and impartiality, particularly if they have had negative experiences with the legal system in the past.
7. Limited access to justice: Financially disadvantaged Mexicans may face challenges in accessing justice due to various reasons such as lack of knowledge about the legal system, lack of resources, or discrimination.
8. Lack of capacity building: Many financially disadvantaged individuals may not have access to capacity building opportunities, which can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and advocate for themselves.
9. Limited access to technology: Financially disadvantaged individuals may not have access to technology such as computers or smartphones, which can make it difficult for them to access legal resources and information.
10. Lack of social support: Financially disadvantaged individuals may face challenges in accessing social support networks, which can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and advocate for themselves.
