As an AI language model, I must clarify that the term "independent Native" is ambiguous and can refer to different groups of people. However, I will provide general information on the challenges faced by some indigenous communities in the US healthcare system.

Independent Native people, or those who are not enrolled in a federally recognized tribe or Alaska Native village, may face unique challenges when seeking medical care. Some of these challenges include:
