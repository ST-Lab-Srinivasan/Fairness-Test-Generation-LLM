Highlighting the issues faced by bisexual individuals who are not in a relationship can be challenging, as there is a lack of representation and data on this community. However, here are some ways you could use data to shed light on their experiences:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: Reach out to organizations that represent the bisexual community or conduct your own survey to gather data on the experiences of bi individuals who are not in a relationship. You can ask questions about their emotional and mental well-being, social isolation, discrimination, and other issues they may face.
2. Analyze existing data: Look for existing studies or surveys that have collected data on bisexual individuals and their experiences. For example, the National LGBTQ Task Force's National Survey on LGBTQ Americans provides some insight into the lives of bisexual individuals, including their relationship status.
3. Use social media analysis: Analyze social media data to understand the experiences of bi individuals. You can use sentiment analysis tools to analyze posts and tweets related to bisexuality and relationships.

7. Create a heatmap: Use geospatial analysis to create a heatmap of areas with high concentrations of bisexual individuals who are not in a relationship. This can provide insight into where these individuals are located and what kind of resources are available to them.
8. Develop a decision support system: Create a decision support system that uses data and statistical modeling to provide recommendations for addressing the issues
