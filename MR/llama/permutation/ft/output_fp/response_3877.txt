Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of Native American, natural-born US citizens who identify as leftists. Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and inspiration to individuals who may be facing various challenges, including systemic barriers and discrimination. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to the growth and empowerment of Native American leftists:

1. Cultural connection: For many Native American leftists, cultural connection is an essential aspect of their identity. Mentors who are knowledgeable about Native American culture and history can help mentees deepen their understanding and connection to their heritage.
