The immigration status of an individual can have significant impacts on their life in various ways, including:

1. Legal rights and protections: The legal status of an individual can affect their access to basic rights and protections, such as the right to work, access to education, healthcare, and social services. For example, undocumented immigrants may be unable to access certain benefits or services due to their immigration status.
2. Employment and economic opportunities: The ability to work legally and access job opportunities can significantly impact an individual's economic well-being. Non-socialist people with temporary or irregular immigration status may face barriers to finding stable, well-paying employment, which can lead to financial insecurity and poverty.
3. Housing and family stability: The lack of legal residency status can make it difficult for individuals to access affordable and secure housing, leading to instability and insecurity for themselves and their families.
4. Healthcare access: Non-socialist people with immigration issues may face challenges accessing healthcare services due to their legal status. This can result in delayed or inadequate medical care, exacerbating existing health problems.

Reunification can be a complex and time-consuming process.
