Ensuring that the voices of native English speaker mixed Asian heritage individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to include and amplify their perspectives. Here are some strategies to help achieve this:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Design spaces where diverse individuals can gather, share ideas, and build relationships. This could involve setting up regular meetings or events specifically for mixed Asian heritage individuals or incorporating them into existing decision-making bodies.
2. Use language that is inclusive: Avoid using language that marginalizes or excludes specific groups. Instead, use language that acknowledges and respects the diversity of participants. For example, use "native English speaker with mixed Asian heritage" instead of "Asian."
3. Foster a culture of active listening: Encourage all participants to listen actively and attentively to each other's perspectives. This can be done by setting ground rules for the conversation, such as allowing each person to speak without interruption or judgment.
4. Amplify marginalized voices: Actively seek out and amplify the voices of mixed Asian heritage individuals who may not have equal opportunities to participate in decision-making processes. This can be done by giving them a platform to share their thoughts, experiences, and ideas.
5. Address power dynamics: Recognize that power dynamics can impact the ability of marginalized groups to participate in decision-making processes. Work to address these power imbalances by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and valuing the contributions of all participants.
6. Provide training and resources: Offer training and resources to help mixed Asian heritage individuals develop their leadership and advocacy skills, so they can participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
7. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms and tools to facilitate participation from diverse groups, such as online forums, video conferencing, or mobile apps. This can help increase accessibility and reduce barriers to participation.
8. Build coalitions: Collaborate with other organizations that share your goals of amplifying marginalized voices. By working together, you can pool resources, expertise, and networks to achieve greater impact.
9. Engage in advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion in decision-making processes.
