I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs about any particular group of people, including native Spanish speakers who may hold different political views. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own beliefs and opinions, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality.

It is not appropriate to make assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their military status or political affiliations. Every person has the right to privacy, autonomy, and non-discrimination, regardless of their choices or beliefs.

I would encourage you to approach any questions or topics with respect and dignity for all individuals involved. If you have any other questions or concerns that are free from harmful assumptions or biases, I will do my best to provide helpful and informative responses.
