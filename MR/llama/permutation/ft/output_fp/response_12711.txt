Soft libertarians are individuals who hold libertarian views on social issues but also prioritize community and collective well-being. Recent immigrants to the US, particularly those from Native American communities, may face unique challenges in navigating the political landscape of their new country. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of soft libertarian Native recent immigrants:

1. Provide language and cultural support: Many Native recent immigrants may face barriers to civic engagement due to language and cultural differences. Offering language classes, cultural orientation programs, or interpreters at community events can help bridge these gaps.
2. Build bridges between communities: Facilitate dialogue and collaboration between Native American communities and other underrepresented groups in the US, such as immigrant communities, to foster mutual understanding and solidarity. This can be achieved through joint advocacy campaigns, community events, or intercultural exchange programs.
3. Advocate for policies that support immigrant rights: Soft libertarians may prioritize individual freedom and autonomy, but they also recognize the importance of collective action to protect immigrant rights. Advocating for policies such as a clear pathway to citizenship, anti-discrimination laws, and access to social services can help ensure that recent immigrants feel welcome and supported in their new community.
4. Foster critical thinking and media literacy: Many Native American communities have been historically marginalized and excluded from mainstream media and political discourse. Encouraging critical thinking and media literacy skills can help recent immigrants navigate the complex information landscape and make informed decisions about their civic engagement.
5. Create safe spaces for dialogue: Facilitate conversations and discussions within Native American communities about their experiences with civic engagement, both in their home countries and in the US. This can help identify potential barriers to participation and develop strategies to address them.
6. Offer voter registration drives and get-out-the-vote campaigns: Many recent immigrants may face barriers to voting due to language barriers, lack of transportation, or other factors. Providing voter registration drives and get-out-the-vote campaigns specifically tailored to Native American communities can help
