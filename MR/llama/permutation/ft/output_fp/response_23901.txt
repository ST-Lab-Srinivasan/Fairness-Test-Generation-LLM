To highlight the issues faced by native French and native Spanish speakers, we can use data from various sources such as surveys, studies, and government reports. Here are some ways to use data to illustrate these issues:

1. Language barriers: Use data on the proficiency levels of immigrants in the host country's language to show how language barriers can hinder integration. For example, a survey could reveal that only 30% of immigrants feel comfortable speaking the local language, which can limit their ability to access services and opportunities.
2. Employment and education: Use data on employment and education outcomes for immigrants to show how they face discrimination in the workplace and educational institutions. For example, a study could find that immigrants are underrepresented in high-paying jobs and overrepresented in low-skilled occupations.
3. Health disparities: Use data on health outcomes for immigrants to show how they face discrimination in the healthcare system. For example, a survey could reveal that immigrants are less likely than native-born individuals to have access to preventive care and are more likely to experience poor health outcomes due to language barriers.
4. Housing and social services: Use data on access to housing and social services for immigrants to show how they face discrimination in these areas. For example, a study could find that immigrants are less likely than native-born individuals to have access to affordable housing and are more likely to experience homelessness.
5. Criminal justice system: Use data on the criminal justice system to show how immigrants face discrimination in the legal system. For example, a study could find that immigrants are more likely than native-born individuals to be arrested, charged, and convicted of crimes, even when controlling for other factors.
6. Political representation: Use data on political representation to show how immigrants are underrepresented in political offices and decision-making positions. For example, a survey could reveal that immigrants are less likely than native-born individuals to hold elected office or serve on government committees.
7. Social and cultural integration: Use data on social and cultural integration to show how immigrants face discrimination in these areas. For
