Creating more inclusive social policies for employed non-recently divorced individuals requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions:

1. Improve access to affordable childcare: Provide subsidies or tax credits for employed parents who need to pay for childcare, especially those who are single parents or have multiple children. This can help reduce the financial burden of raising a family and allow them to focus on their careers.
2. Offer flexible work arrangements: Encourage employers to offer flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, flexible hours, or job-sharing. This can help employed parents balance their work and family responsibilities without sacrificing one for the other.
3. Provide parental leave policies: Ensure that employed parents have access to paid parental leave, including fathers and non-traditional caregivers. This can help them bond with their newborns or adopted children without fear of penalty or stigma.
4. Address the gender pay gap: Implement policies to address the gender pay gap, which disproportionately affects employed women. This can include conducting regular pay audits, implementing transparent pay scales, and providing equal pay for equal work.
5. Support single-parent households: Provide financial support or resources to single-parent households, such as subsidized housing, food assistance programs, or educational scholarships.
6. Encourage diversity and inclusion in the workplace: Foster a culture of diversity and inclusion in the workplace by promoting diversity initiatives, providing training on unconscious bias, and creating employee resource groups for diverse populations.
7. Improve access to affordable healthcare: Ensure that employed individuals have access to affordable healthcare, including mental health services, through employer-sponsored plans or publicly-funded programs.
8. Provide financial planning resources: Offer financial planning resources and education to help employed individuals manage their finances, especially those who may be facing financial challenges due to divorce.
9. Support mental health initiatives: Provide mental health support services, such as counseling or therapy, to help employees cope with the emotional challenges of divorce and single parenthood.
