6. Limited understanding of legal rights and responsibilities: Many individuals may not be aware of their legal rights and responsibilities, which can lead to them being taken advantage of or exploited.
7. Difficulty in accessing legal aid: Obtaining legal aid can be challenging, especially for those who are low-income or have limited financial resources.
8. Limited availability of legal resources: In some areas, there may be a lack of legal resources, such as lawyers, legal clinics, or other organizations that provide legal assistance.
9. Difficulty in navigating the court system: The court system can be complex and overwhelming for individuals who are not familiar with it, leading to difficulties in navigating the process.
