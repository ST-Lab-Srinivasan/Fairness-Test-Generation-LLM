3. Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance to mid-50s active-duty individuals who may need help covering the costs of accessibility modifications or home repairs. This could include grants, low-interest loans, or other forms of financial support.
4. Home Modification Programs: Develop home modification programs that provide low-cost or free services to mid-50s active-duty individuals who need help making their homes more accessible. These programs could include things like wheelchair ramps, widened doorways, and bathroom modifications.
5.

This could include organizations that provide free or low-cost home modifications for seniors, people with disabilities, or other vulnerable populations.
6. Education and Outreach: Provide education and outreach to mid-50s active-duty individuals about the importance of accessibility in housing policies.
