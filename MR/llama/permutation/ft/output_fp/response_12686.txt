Temporary visa holders, including those from Orthodox Jewish communities, may face various challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Language barriers: Many Orthodox Jewish individuals may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties when interacting with law enforcement officers or navigating court procedures.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in many countries is based on Western traditions and values that may not align with the beliefs and practices of Orthodox Jewish communities. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, particularly around issues like modesty and gender separation.

4.

Orthodox Jewish individuals may find themselves in situations where their religious beliefs or practices are at odds with the legal system, creating challenges and potential for misunderstandings.
