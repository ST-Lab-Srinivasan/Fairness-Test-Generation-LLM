There are many successful community initiatives led by beginner French speakers who are not high-income professional individuals. Here are a few examples:

1. Conversation Exchange Groups: Many beginners start by attending conversation exchange groups where they practice speaking with native French speakers in a relaxed atmosphere. These groups can be found through local language schools, community centers, or online platforms like Meetup.com.
2. Language Learning Podcasts: There are several podcasts created by beginner French learners who share their experiences, tips, and resources with the community. Some popular ones include "Coffee Break French," "French Together," and "Learn French with Alexa."
3. Online Language Communities: Websites like Reddit's r/LearnFrench, r/French, and language learning forums on Quora and Stack Exchange offer a platform for beginners to connect with each other, share resources, and get support in their language learning journey.
4. Community Language Events: Many communities organize language events, such as cultural festivals, movie nights, and language exchange meetups, where beginners can practice speaking with native speakers in a fun and relaxed environment.
5. Volunteer Work: Many beginner French learners volunteer at local organizations or charities to practice their language skills while giving back to the community. This not only helps them improve their language abilities but also provides an opportunity to connect with people from different backgrounds.
6. Language Learning App Groups: There are several language learning apps available that offer groups for beginners to practice together and share resources. Some popular ones include Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone.
7. Book Clubs: Many beginners start book clubs where they read French books and discuss them with other learners. This not only helps improve their language skills but also provides a chance to explore French culture and literature.
8. Language Exchange Partnerships: Some beginner French learners form partnerships with native French speakers who are learning their own languages. This exchange can help both parties improve their language skills and gain cultural insights.
9. Community Language Classes: Many communities offer language classes specifically designed for beginners. These classes provide a structured environment where learners can practice speaking, writing, and listening to French with guidance from experienced teachers.
