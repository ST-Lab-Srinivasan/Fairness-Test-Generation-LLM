As a permanent resident of Australia, there are several challenges that solo people in the healthcare system may face. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to affordable healthcare: As a permanent resident, you may not have access to the same level of healthcare as Australian citizens and permanent residents who hold a valid Medicare card. This can make it difficult to access affordable healthcare, particularly if you are in a situation where you need ongoing medical attention.
2. Limited access to public hospitals: Public hospitals in Australia are generally available to all patients, regardless of their residency status. However, some public hospitals may prioritize patients who hold a valid Medicare card, which can result in longer wait times for non-citizens and permanent residents.
3. High out-of-pocket costs: As a permanent resident, you may be responsible for paying higher out-of-pocket costs for healthcare services than Australian citizens and permanent residents. This can make it difficult to access healthcare, particularly if you are in a situation where you need ongoing medical attention.
4. Limited access to specialist care: Depending on your location and the type of specialist care you need, you may have limited access to specialists who accept your insurance or who are willing to see non-citizens or permanent residents.
5. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: As a non-citizen or permanent resident, you may find it difficult to navigate the complexities of the Australian healthcare system, particularly if you are not familiar with the language or cultural norms.
6. Limited access to mental health services: Depending on your location and the type of mental health service you need, you may have limited access to mental health professionals who accept your insurance or who are willing to see non-citizens or permanent residents.
7. Difficulty accessing prescription medications: Depending on your residency status, you may have difficulty accessing prescription medications, particularly if they are only available through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).
8. Limited access to preventative care: As a permanent resident, you may have limited access to preventative healthcare services, such as routine check-ups and screenings, which can make it difficult to maintain good health
