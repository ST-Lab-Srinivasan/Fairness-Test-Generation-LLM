Ensuring the voices of native Chinese speakers, particularly those who are not long-time married individuals, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for creating inclusive and equitable policies. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is accessible and inclusive of all Chinese speakers, regardless of their marital status. Avoid using language that assumes a specific marital status or background.
2. Representation: Ensure that the decision-making process includes representatives from diverse backgrounds, including native Chinese speakers who are not long-time married individuals. This can be achieved through deliberate efforts to recruit and include these voices in the decision-making process.
3. Participatory Processes: Use participatory processes such as citizen juries, town hall meetings, or other forms of community engagement that allow for diverse voices to be heard. These processes should be designed to ensure that all participants have an equal opportunity to contribute and be heard.
4. Capacity Building: Provide training and resources to support native Chinese speakers who are not long-time married individuals in developing their leadership and advocacy skills. This can help them feel more confident and equipped to participate in decision-making processes.
5. Networking: Connect native Chinese speakers who are not long-time married individuals with other individuals and organizations that share similar interests and concerns. This can help build a network of support and solidarity that can amplify their voices in the decision-making process.
6. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote greater representation and participation of native Chinese speakers who are not long-time married individuals in decision-making processes. This can include changes to electoral systems, appointment processes, or other mechanisms that affect representation.
7. Media Literacy: Promote media literacy among native Chinese speakers who are not long-time married individuals, to help them better understand and navigate the media landscape. This can enable them to access information, analyze issues, and make informed decisions about their lives and communities.
8. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and outreach efforts that target native Chinese speakers who are not long-time married individuals. This can help build trust and rapport with these groups, and ensure that their voices are heard in decision-making processes
