Recently undocumented long-time married people may face a range of challenges when seeking medical care and navigating the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Fear of discrimination: These individuals may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of being identified as undocumented and facing discrimination or deportation.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Undocumented immigrants often have limited access to healthcare services, including preventive care, emergency care, and specialty care. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, which can worsen outcomes and increase costs in the long run.
3. Language barriers: Many undocumented immigrants may face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, which can hinder effective communication and result in misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
4. Lack of insurance coverage: Undocumented immigrants are often uninsured, which means they may not have access to necessary medical care or prescription medications. This can lead to delayed care or foregoing needed treatment due to financial constraints.
5. Difficulty finding culturally competent care: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges in finding healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about their cultural background and speak their language. This can lead to mistrust of the medical system and delayed or foregone care.
6. Legal concerns: Undocumented immigrants may worry about sharing personal information with healthcare providers, including their immigration status, which can make it difficult to receive appropriate care.
7. Difficulty navigating the medical system: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges in understanding the complexities of the medical system, including how to access care, how to pay for care, and how to navigate the billing and insurance processes.
8. Lack of trust in the medical system: Undocumented immigrants may have had negative experiences with the medical system in the past, such as feeling ignored or dismissed by healthcare providers, which can lead to a lack of trust and hesitancy to seek care.
9. Stigma and shame: Undocumented immigrants may feel ashamed or embarrassed about their immigration status
