Creating more inclusive social policies for bourgeois unmarried individuals involves addressing the unique challenges and discrimination faced by this group. Here are some strategies that policymakers can consider:

1. Recognize the economic inequality faced by unmarried bourgeois individuals: Many unmarried bourgeois individuals face significant economic inequality due to their lack of access to social security benefits, inheritance rights, and other financial resources available to married couples.
