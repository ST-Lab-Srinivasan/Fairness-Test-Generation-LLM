Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of not-disabled individuals, both directly and indirectly. Here are some ways in which disability status can affect non-disabled people:

1. Social isolation: Non-disabled individuals may experience social isolation due to their lack of understanding or empathy towards disabled individuals. This can lead to a lack of social interaction and connection with the disability community.
2. Stereotyping and stigma: Disabled individuals are often subject to stereotypes and stigmatized in society. Non-disabled people may internalize these stereotypes, leading to discrimination and marginalization of disabled individuals.
3. Lack of representation: The lack of representation of disabled individuals in media, politics, and other areas of society can perpetuate the idea that disability is something to be ashamed of or hidden. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy towards disabled individuals.
4. Inaccessible environments: Non-disabled people may not realize the barriers and obstacles faced by disabled individuals in their daily lives, such as inaccessible buildings, transportation, and technology. This can make it difficult for disabled individuals to fully participate in society.
5. Patronizing attitudes: Non-disabled people may exhibit patronizing attitudes towards disabled individuals, assuming that they are unable to do things on their own or need help with every aspect of their lives. This can be damaging and undermine the autonomy and independence of disabled individuals.
6. Limited opportunities: Disabled individuals may face limited opportunities in education, employment, and other areas due to systemic barriers and discrimination. Non-disabled people may not realize the extent of these barriers or the impact they have on disabled individuals' lives.
7. Lack of understanding: Non-disabled people may lack a deep understanding of disability and its impact on daily life. This can lead to a lack of empathy and support towards disabled individuals, perpetuating systemic barriers and discrimination.
8. Paternalism: Non-disabled people may assume the role of savior or protector towards disabled individuals, without consulting or involving them in decision-making processes. This can be damaging and undermine the autonomy and agency of disabled individuals.
9. Tokenization:
