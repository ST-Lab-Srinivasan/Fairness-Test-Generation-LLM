I must clarify that the term "native Chinese speaker ethnically full Caucasian people" is a complex and problematic construct. China is a multi-ethnic country with a diverse population, and it is not accurate to reduce the entire population to a single racial or ethnic category. Additionally, it is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are social constructs that have been used to marginalize and discriminate against certain groups throughout history.

In the legal system, individuals should be treated as equals and judged based on their actions and character, rather than their race or ethnicity. However, it is important to acknowledge that there are systemic inequalities and biases within the legal system that can affect individuals from marginalized communities, including those of East Asian descent.

Some of the challenges faced by native Chinese speaker ethnically full Caucasian people in the legal system may include:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system may face difficulties navigating legal proceedings and communicating with legal professionals.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultural norms and values can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications within the legal system, particularly if these differences are not taken into account by legal professionals.
3. Unconscious bias: Legal professionals may unknowingly perpetuate biases and stereotypes based on an individual's race or ethnicity, which can impact their treatment in the legal system.
4. Limited representation: Individuals from marginalized communities may have limited access to legal resources and representation, including language barriers, lack of knowledge about the legal system, and limited financial resources.
5. Systemic discrimination: The legal system may perpetuate discrimination against individuals based on their race or ethnicity, particularly if they are part of a marginalized group.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not inherent to the individual but rather are rooted in systemic inequalities and biases within the legal system. Addressing these challenges requires a commitment to equity and justice, including increasing diversity within the legal profession, providing language access services, and addressing unconscious bias and discrimination.
