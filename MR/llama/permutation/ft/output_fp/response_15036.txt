I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about someone's identity or experiences based on their socioeconomic status. Everyone has their own unique perspective and experiences, regardless of their class background. It's important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, and not make judgments or assumptions about them based on superficial characteristics like their wealth or social status.

It's also worth noting that being undocumented is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects people from all walks of life, regardless of their socioeconomic status. It's important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect, and to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about any group of people.

Instead of focusing on assumptions or stereotypes about undocumented immigrants based on their class background, it's more productive to listen to their personal experiences and perspectives. By doing so, you can gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and obstacles they face, and work towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society for everyone.
