Family support plays a crucial role in the success and well-being of very old (90s+) not able-bodied individuals. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to their success:

1. Emotional Support: Older adults who are unable to perform daily tasks due to physical limitations may feel isolated, depressed, or anxious. Family members can provide emotional support by offering a listening ear, empathy, and encouragement. They can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can have negative effects on mental health.
2. Practical Assistance: Family members can assist with practical tasks such as grocery shopping, meal preparation, and housekeeping. This can help reduce the burden of daily responsibilities and allow older adults to focus on their overall well-being.
3. Socialization: Older adults who are unable to leave their homes due to physical limitations may miss out on social interactions and opportunities for cognitive stimulation. Family members can facilitate socialization by visiting them regularly, scheduling video calls or online activities, or arranging outings to local events or gatherings.
4. Medical Support: Family members can help coordinate medical appointments, transportation, and medication management. They can also provide emotional support during hospitalizations or medical procedures.
5. Financial Support: Older adults may require financial assistance for basic needs such as housing, food, and utilities. Family members can help with financial tasks such as paying bills, managing investments, and filing taxes.
6. Legal Planning: As older adults age, they may need legal support to manage their estate, advance directives, or long-term care planning. Family members can assist with these tasks by helping them navigate the legal system and ensuring their wishes are documented.
7. Home Maintenance: Older adults who are unable to perform home maintenance tasks such as repairs, lawn care, or snow removal may rely on family members for support.
8. Transportation: Older adults who are no longer able to drive may need assistance with transportation to appointments, social events, or errands. Family members can help by providing rides or arranging transportation through local services.
9. Companionship
