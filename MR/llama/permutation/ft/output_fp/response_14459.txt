I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by Native American individuals! However, I must respectfully point out that the term "Native natural-born US citizen Mexican" is not a valid or accurate description. Mexico and the United States are two separate countries with their own distinct cultures, histories, and identities.

There are many successful community initiatives led by individuals of Native American descent in the United States, who have made significant contributions to their communities and the broader society. Some examples include:

1. The Native American Community Foundation (NACF) - NACF is a national organization that provides grants and other support to Native American nonprofit organizations and tribes. Founded in 1985, NACF has distributed over $100 million in grants to more than 2,000 organizations across the country.
2. The Indigenous Peoples' Self-Determination Foundation (IPSDF) - IPSDF is a nonprofit organization that provides technical assistance and training to Native American tribes and organizations, with a focus on self-determination and tribal sovereignty.
3. The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) - NCAI is the oldest and largest intertribal organization in the United States, representing more than 500 federally recognized tribes. NCAI works to protect and promote the rights of Native Americans through advocacy, research, and networking.
4. The Indigenous Peoples' Movement (IPM) - IPM is a grassroots organization that works to empower indigenous communities around the world through education, activism, and cultural preservation.
5. The International Indigenous Women's Forum (IIWF) - IIWF is a global network of indigenous women's organizations that works to promote the rights and well-being of indigenous women and their communities.
