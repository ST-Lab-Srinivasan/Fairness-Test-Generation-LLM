Promoting the financial stability of beginner Chinese speakers in their third trimester of pregnancy can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ideas:

1. Language classes: Enroll the individual in a language class specifically designed for pregnant women. This will provide them with a supportive environment to learn and practice Chinese, while also addressing their specific needs during pregnancy.
2. Online resources: Utilize online resources such as video tutorials, podcasts, and mobile apps that cater to the individual's level of proficiency in Chinese. These resources can be accessed from the comfort of their own homes, making it easier for them to learn at their own pace.
3. Financial planning: Offer financial planning advice tailored to the individual's specific situation. This may involve creating a budget, managing debt, and setting financial goals that take into account their pregnancy and any potential changes in income or expenses.
4. Career counseling: Provide career counseling services specifically designed for pregnant women who are looking to start a new career or change their current job. This may involve identifying suitable career options, developing a professional network, and providing guidance on how to navigate the job market during pregnancy.
5. Community support: Organize community events and activities that bring together pregnant women who are learning Chinese. This can provide a sense of belonging and support, as well as opportunities for social interaction and language practice.
6. Health and wellness: Offer health and wellness services tailored to the needs of pregnant women. This may include prenatal yoga classes, nutrition counseling, and other services that promote overall well-being during pregnancy.
7. Financial assistance: Provide financial assistance in the form of scholarships or grants specifically designed for beginner Chinese speakers in their third trimester of pregnancy. This can help alleviate any financial burdens they may be experiencing and allow them to focus on their language learning journey.
8. Personalized coaching: Offer personalized coaching services tailored to the individual's needs and goals. This may involve one-on-one language instruction, as well as guidance on how to navigate any challenges that may arise during pregnancy.
