As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that the term "mixed African-American" is not a widely used or recognized categorization in the United States. The US Census Bureau recognizes only two racial categories: non-Hispanic White and Black or African American. However, I understand that you may be referring to individuals who identify as both African American and another race or ethnicity.

Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for all healthcare providers, regardless of their own cultural background. Here are some benefits of cultural competence for beginner English speakers who work with mixed-race populations:

1. Improved patient trust and rapport: When healthcare providers demonstrate an understanding of the cultural nuances and values of their patients, it can help build trust and improve communication. This is particularly important for individuals who may feel marginalized or misunderstood in mainstream healthcare settings.
2. More accurate diagnosis and treatment: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers recognize and address cultural-specific barriers to healthcare access, such as language or transportation issues. It can also lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatments tailored to the patient's cultural beliefs and practices.
3. Enhanced quality of care: By considering patients' cultural values and practices, healthcare providers can provide more comprehensive and effective care. This may involve incorporating traditional healing practices or addressing cultural-specific concerns about modesty or spirituality.
4. Better patient outcomes: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they are better equipped to address the unique needs of their patients. This can lead to improved patient outcomes and increased satisfaction with care.
5. Increased cultural awareness and sensitivity: Cultural competence training can help healthcare providers recognize and challenge their own biases and assumptions, leading to more culturally sensitive and aware care.
6. Enhanced teamwork and collaboration: When healthcare providers work together with a shared understanding of cultural differences and similarities, they can provide more effective and efficient care. This can lead to better patient outcomes and improved teamwork and collaboration.
7. Improved communication with families and communities: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients' families and communities, which is essential for providing comprehensive and coordinated care.
