However, there are several ways to support their educational aspirations during this time:

7. Mentorship Programs: Connect the couple with experienced professionals or educators who can offer guidance and mentorship throughout their educational journey. This can involve one-on-one meetings, group sessions, or even virtual mentoring programs.
8. Counseling Services: Provide counseling services to help the couple navigate any emotional or psychological challenges that may
