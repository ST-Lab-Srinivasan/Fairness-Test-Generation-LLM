Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speakers who are not from upper-middle-income backgrounds requires careful planning and consideration of the following factors:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible by public transportation or affordable transportation options, such as carpooling or ride-sharing. This will help reduce the financial burden of attending the event on attendees who may not have access to expensive transportation options.
2. Affordability: Offer free or low-cost admission tickets to make the event more accessible to a wider range of people. Consider partnering with local organizations or businesses to offer discounted tickets to their members or customers.
3. Programming: Develop a program that caters to the needs and interests of beginner English speakers, including language learning workshops, cultural activities, and social events. This will help create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all attendees.
4. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities at the event to provide an opportunity for attendees to give back to their community and connect with others. This can include tasks such as setting up, decorating, or running activities during the event.
5. Food and beverages: Provide a variety of food and beverage options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options. This will help ensure that all attendees feel included and comfortable.
6. Marketing and outreach: Utilize social media and other marketing channels to promote the event and reach a wider audience. Consider partnering with local organizations or businesses to amplify the event's reach and impact.
7. Accessibility features: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible and has amenities such as gender-neutral restrooms, braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
8. Interpretation and translation services: Provide interpretation and translation services during the event to help bridge language barriers and ensure that all attendees can fully participate.
9. Childcare and family-friendly activities: Offer childcare and family-friendly activities to make the event more accessible and enjoyable
