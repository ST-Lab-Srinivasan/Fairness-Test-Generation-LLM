Creating more inclusive recreational activities for permanent residents who are not part of the upper class requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify underserved populations: Research the demographics of your local community to identify groups that may be excluded from recreational opportunities, such as low-income areas, racial or ethnic minorities, or people with disabilities.
2. Conduct needs assessments: Engage with these communities through surveys, focus groups, or interviews to understand their recreational interests and barriers to participation. This will help you tailor your activities to meet their specific needs.
3. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve underserved populations, such as community centers, schools, or non-profit groups. They can provide valuable insights and resources to reach these communities.
4. Offer flexible programming: Develop recreational activities that are accessible and affordable for a wide range of people, including those with limited financial means or mobility issues.

6. Provide transportation options: Offer transportation services or coordinate with local transportation providers to ensure that underserved populations can easily access recreational facilities or activities.
