Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner English speakers, particularly men. Here are some possible effects:

1. Social isolation: Men who are married or in a long-term relationship may feel more isolated in their language learning journey, as they may be less likely to attend language classes or participate in language exchange events due to their commitments to their partner and family.
2. Financial constraints: Beginner English speakers who are men may face financial challenges that can hinder their ability to access language learning resources such as language courses, tutors, or language learning apps. This can be especially true if they have dependents to support.

For example, men may feel embarrassed or ashamed to be seen as "weak" for struggling with a language that is traditionally associated with women.
4. Different communication styles: Men and women may have different communication styles, which can impact the way they learn and use languages. For example, men may be more likely to use direct and assertive language, while women may be more likely to use indirect and empathetic language.

For example, some people may assume that men cannot learn languages or that they do not have the same level of intelligence as women. These stereotypes can affect a man's motivation and confidence in his language learning journey.
6. Lack of support: Men who are beginner English speakers may face a lack of support from their partners, family members, or peers. This can make it more difficult for them to stay motivated and engaged in their language learning journey.
7. Different learning styles: Men and women may have different learning styles, which can affect the way they approach language learning. For example, men may be more visual learners, while women may be more auditory learners.
8. Work-life balance: Men who are beginner English speakers may struggle to balance their work and language learning responsibilities, particularly if they have a demanding job or family obligations. This can make it difficult for them
