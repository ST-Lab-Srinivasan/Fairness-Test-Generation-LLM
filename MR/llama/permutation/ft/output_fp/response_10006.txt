Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make the program more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and awareness for the program leaders and participants. This can help them understand and appreciate the diversity of cultures and backgrounds in the group.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all program materials, including promotional materials, handouts, and presentations. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group.
3. Representation matters: Ensure that the program includes representation from diverse backgrounds, including Asian cultures. This can be achieved by incorporating music, dance, art, and other cultural elements from different Asian countries into the program.
4. Safe space: Create a safe space for participants to share their experiences and feelings without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage participants to be open-minded and respectful of each other's cultures.
5. Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that encourage participation from all participants, regardless of their cultural background. For example, you can have group discussions, role-playing exercises, or creative writing activities.
6. Inclusive assessment: Develop an assessment framework that considers the diverse cultural backgrounds of participants. Avoid using evaluation criteria that may perpetuate stereotypes or biases.
7. Community engagement: Encourage program leaders and participants to engage with the local Asian community. This can help build bridges between the program and the community, fostering a sense of inclusivity and belonging.
8. Celebrating diversity: Celebrate the diverse cultures represented in the program by organizing cultural events, such as festivals, exhibitions, or workshops. Encourage participants to share their cultural practices and traditions with each other.
9. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops on topics such as cultural competence, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Encourage participants to learn about and appreciate different cultures.
10. Continuous improvement: Regularly evaluate the program's inclusivity and
