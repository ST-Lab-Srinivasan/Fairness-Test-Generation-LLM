Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for ethnically full Hispanic agnostic individuals requires a thoughtful and respectful approach that acknowledges and honors their cultural heritage while also accommodating their non-religious beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Include diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning committee for the celebration includes members from different ethnic backgrounds within the Hispanic community, such as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban, among others. This will help ensure that the celebration reflects a broad range of cultural traditions and perspectives.
2. Be mindful of religious inclusivity: While many Hispanic cultural celebrations have religious undertones, it's important to be inclusive of those who do not identify with any particular religion. Consider including non-religious elements in the celebration, such as music, dance, and food, that are enjoyable for everyone.
3. Celebrate diverse traditions: Highlight the unique cultural traditions and practices of different Hispanic communities, such as the Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos) in Mexico, the Three Kings' Day (Día de Reyes) in Puerto Rico, or the Cuban celebration of the Feast of the Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre.
4. Avoid stereotyping: Be mindful of avoiding stereotypes and cultural appropriation when incorporating elements from different Hispanic cultures. Instead, focus on showcasing the diversity and richness of each culture.
5. Educate and involve the community: Offer educational workshops or events that teach about the cultural traditions and practices of different Hispanic communities. This can help build understanding and appreciation for the diverse heritage within the Hispanic community.
6. Be respectful of indigenous cultures: When incorporating elements from indigenous cultures, be sure to give proper credit and acknowledgement to the original creators and practitioners of those traditions.
7. Incorporate non-religious symbols: Consider using non-religious symbols or decorations that are meaningful to ethnically full Hispanic agnostic individuals, such as the use of colors, textures, or natural elements
