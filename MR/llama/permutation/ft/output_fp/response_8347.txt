Furthermore, the concept of military status has no direct impact on a person's language proficiency or their ability to learn Chinese.

Instead, it is important to focus on promoting inclusivity and respect towards all individuals, and recognizing that everyone has the right to pursue their own goals and aspirations without facing discrimination or marginalization.
