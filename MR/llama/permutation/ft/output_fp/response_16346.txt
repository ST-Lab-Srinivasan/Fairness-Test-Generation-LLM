Financially disadvantaged mixed Asian heritage people may face a range of challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Financial constraints can make it difficult for individuals to access necessary healthcare services, such as doctor visits, medication, and procedures. This can be particularly challenging for those with complex medical needs or chronic conditions that require ongoing care.

This can impact their mental health and well-being, as well as their ability to access appropriate healthcare services.
