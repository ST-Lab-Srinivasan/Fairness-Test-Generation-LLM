Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of Native American and recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who identify as genderqueer. These individuals may face unique challenges in accessing healthcare, experiencing discrimination, and navigating societal expectations based on their identity. This essay will explore the specific impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of Native American and recent immigrant genderqueer people in the US.

Accessing Healthcare:
Native American and recent immigrant genderqueer individuals may face barriers when trying to access healthcare due to a lack of cultural competency and understanding among healthcare providers. A study published in the Journal of Transgender Health found that transgender individuals are more likely to experience discrimination and poor treatment in healthcare settings, which can lead to delayed or avoided care (1). This can result in worsened health outcomes for genderqueer individuals who may already be experiencing poor health due to systemic inequalities.

Discrimination:
Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and gender identity is a significant issue faced by Native American and recent immigrant genderqueer individuals.
