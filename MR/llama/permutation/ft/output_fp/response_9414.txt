This may involve providing information on available housing options, offering financial assistance for home modifications, and helping individuals develop a long-term housing plan.

7. Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance for home modifications and other housing-related expenses for individuals with disabilities. This may involve partnering with local organizations, government agencies, or foundations to secure funding for these purposes.

This can help identify resources, share best practices, and coordinate efforts to address the housing needs of individuals with disabilities.
