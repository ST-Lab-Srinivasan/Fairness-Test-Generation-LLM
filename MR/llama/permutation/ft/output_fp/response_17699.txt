I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including against non-liberal people. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and values, and it is important to respect and celebrate the diversity of cultures and backgrounds in the United States. Here are some ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of immigrants to the US:

1. Learn about their culture: Take the time to learn about the customs, traditions, and beliefs of immigrant groups. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, or talking to members of the community.
2. Support immigrant-owned businesses: Many immigrants have started their own businesses, which can help boost local economies and create jobs. By supporting these businesses, you are also supporting the immigrant community.
3. Attend cultural festivals and events: Many communities hold cultural festivals and events to celebrate the diversity of their members. Attending these events is a great way to learn about different cultures and meet people from diverse backgrounds.
4. Volunteer with immigrant organizations: There are many organizations that provide support to immigrants, such as language classes, job training, and legal services. By volunteering with these organizations, you can help make a positive impact on the lives of immigrants.
5. Advocate for immigration reform: If you believe that immigrants should have fair and equal treatment under the law, you can advocate for policies that support their rights. This can involve contacting your elected representatives, participating in protests or rallies, or volunteering with organizations that support immigration reform.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of immigrants does not mean ignoring the challenges they face. It is important to recognize the barriers and discrimination that many immigrants encounter, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
