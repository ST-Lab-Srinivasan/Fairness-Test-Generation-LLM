Creating more inclusive cultural programs for nominal Christian beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the audience: Start by conducting research on the target audience, including their demographics, interests, and cultural backgrounds. This will help you tailor the program to meet their needs and preferences.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs include a variety of voices and viewpoints. This can be achieved by featuring guest speakers from different backgrounds, showcasing diverse art forms, or incorporating multicultural music and dance.
3. Use accessible language: Avoid using technical jargon or complex terminology that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Instead, use clear and concise language that is easy to grasp.
4. Provide context: Offer historical and cultural context to help beginner Chinese speakers better understand the cultural practices and traditions they are learning about.
5. Make it interactive: Incorporate interactive elements into the program, such as discussions, games, or hands-on activities. This will help keep the audience engaged and involved.
6. Be inclusive of different beliefs and practices: Recognize that there may be different beliefs and practices within the Chinese community, and avoid promoting any one particular viewpoint over others.
7. Offer support: Provide resources and support to help beginner Chinese speakers continue their cultural education outside of the program. This could include recommending books, websites, or other learning materials.
8. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for participants to connect with one another and build relationships. This can be done through group activities, social events, or online forums.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential power dynamics at play in cultural programs, particularly those that involve privileged groups (e.g., majority groups) versus marginalized groups (e.g., minority groups). Take steps to address these imbalances and create a more equitable learning environment.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the effectiveness of the cultural programs and gather feedback from participants. Use this information to make improvements and adjustments as needed.
