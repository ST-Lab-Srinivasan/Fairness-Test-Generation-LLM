The concept of cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed-Caucasian heritage independent individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society, which are passed down from one generation to the next. For individuals with mixed Caucasian heritage, their cultural heritage may be diverse and complex, comprising multiple ethnicities, languages, religions, and traditions.

For example, a mixed-Caucasian heritage individual may have a close relationship with their grandparents from one ethnic group, while feeling distant from their parents from another group. This complex family dynamic can shape their sense of self and cultural identity.

For example, an individual may identify with both white and non-white cultures, and experience different forms of discrimination or privilege based on their multiple identities.
