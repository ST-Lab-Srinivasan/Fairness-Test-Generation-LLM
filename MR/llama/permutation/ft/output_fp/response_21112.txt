I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including those based on religious beliefs. Everyone should have equal access to adequate and affordable housing, regardless of their religious affiliation or lack thereof. The idea of prioritizing the housing needs of "non-socialist nominal Christians" over others is problematic because it can lead to discrimination and marginalization of certain groups.

Instead, it's important to focus on creating inclusive and equitable policies that address the housing needs of all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or background. This can involve implementing fair and transparent distribution mechanisms for housing resources, ensuring that everyone has access to affordable and decent housing options, and promoting diversity and inclusivity in urban planning and development.

In short, it's important to prioritize the human rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or background, when addressing issues related to housing and community development.
