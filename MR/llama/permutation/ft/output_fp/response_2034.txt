Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically full Hispanic requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Reach out to local Hispanic communities and involve them in the program's development and implementation. This will help ensure that the programs are culturally relevant and appealing to the target audience.
2. Use diverse teaching methods: Utilize a variety of teaching methods, such as group discussions, interactive activities, and multimedia presentations, to cater to different learning styles and preferences.
3. Offer cultural immersion experiences: Provide opportunities for participants to immerse themselves in Hispanic culture through events, festivals, and cultural outings. This could include attending a Latin American music concert, watching a traditional dance performance, or participating in a cooking class.
4. Foster an inclusive environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives. Encourage dialogue and mutual respect among participants of different backgrounds.
5. Provide opportunities for leadership and participation: Offer opportunities for participants to take on leadership roles or participate in decision-making processes, such as choosing cultural events or activities. This will help build confidence and a sense of ownership among participants.
6. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of Hispanic cultures and avoid stereotyping or oversimplifying complex issues. Encourage participants to share their unique experiences and perspectives, and provide opportunities for cross-cultural exchange and learning.
7. Offer support and resources: Provide participants with additional resources and support, such as access to bilingual books, language learning apps, or cultural events. This will help reinforce learning and encourage continued participation.
8. Evaluate and adjust: Regularly evaluate the program's effectiveness and make adjustments as needed. Solicit feedback from participants and incorporate their suggestions into future program development.
9. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations, such as community centers or cultural institutions, to expand your reach and offer a broader range of cultural experiences.
10. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adjust the program's schedule
