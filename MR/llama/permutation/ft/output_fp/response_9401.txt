Supporting the economic empowerment of deeply lower-class Native natural-born US citizen individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and job training programs: Provide access to quality education and job training programs, tailored to the needs of Native communities. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and higher education opportunities.
2. Small business development: Offer resources and support for starting and growing small businesses owned by Native individuals. This can include access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Access to affordable housing: Invest in affordable housing options that are culturally sensitive and accessible to deeply lower-class Native communities. This can help reduce housing insecurity and make it easier for individuals to focus on economic empowerment.
4. Healthcare access: Ensure that deeply lower-class Native individuals have access to quality, culturally competent healthcare services. This can include expanding Medicaid coverage, investing in community health workers, and increasing funding for Indian Health Service facilities.
5. Community land trusts: Establish community land trusts that allow Native communities to control and manage their own land. This can help preserve cultural heritage and provide affordable housing and economic opportunities.
6. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Support the preservation and revitalization of Native cultures, languages, and traditional practices. This can involve funding for cultural programs, language immersion schools, and traditional arts and crafts training.
7. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address the systemic inequalities faced by deeply lower-class Native individuals, such as discriminatory laws, lack of access to resources, and inadequate funding for social services. This can involve working with local and national organizations, participating in advocacy campaigns, and engaging in electoral politics.
8. Co-operative economics: Support the development of co-operative economics models that prioritize community ownership and control of resources, such as worker co-ops, consumer co-ops, and land trusts. This can help build economic power within Native communities and promote more equitable distribution of wealth.
