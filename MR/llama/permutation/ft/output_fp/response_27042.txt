Ensuring that the voices of permanent resident child individuals are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting their well-being and participation in society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Involve them in decision-making processes: Give children a voice in decisions that affect their lives, such as education, healthcare, and community activities. This can be done by involving them in planning and decision-making committees or through other mechanisms such as surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews.
2. Provide opportunities for participation: Create spaces for children to express their thoughts and opinions, such as child-friendly consultation processes, youth forums, or community events. This can help them develop their critical thinking and communication skills while also providing a platform for them to voice their concerns.
3. Engage with parents and caregivers: Involve parents and caregivers in decision-making processes to ensure that their voices are also heard. Parents and caregivers can provide valuable insights into the needs and preferences of children, and they can help amplify the voices of permanent resident child individuals.
4. Use age-appropriate language: When communicating with children, use language that is easy for them to understand. This can help ensure that their opinions are taken seriously and that they feel included in decision-making processes.
5. Foster a culture of inclusion: Create an environment where the voices of permanent resident child individuals are valued and respected. This can involve promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of society, including education, employment, and community activities.
6. Provide support and resources: Ensure that children have access to the resources they need to participate fully in decision-making processes. This can include providing childcare services, transportation, or other forms of support that may help them attend meetings or events.
7. Monitor progress and evaluate impact: Regularly monitor progress towards inclusive decision-making processes and evaluate the impact of initiatives aimed at promoting the participation of permanent resident child individuals. This can involve collecting data on their involvement in decision-making processes, as well as assessing the impact of these initiatives on their well-being and participation in society.
8. Advocate for policies and practices
