I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot advocate for any particular political ideology. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges that people who identify as communists may face within a legal system.

Communism is a political and economic ideology that seeks to create a classless, stateless society in which the means of production are collectively owned and resources are distributed based on need rather than profit. However, many countries have legal systems that are designed to protect property rights and promote free market capitalism, which can pose challenges for those who identify as communists.

Some potential challenges that expecting communist people may face within a legal system include:

1. Difficulty in advocating for collective ownership of means of production: Many legal systems prioritize individual property rights and may be resistant to the idea of collective ownership of resources.
