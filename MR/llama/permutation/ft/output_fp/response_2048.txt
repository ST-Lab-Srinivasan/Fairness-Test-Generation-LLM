Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Arabic speaker mixed Asian heritage individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Center the voices of marginalized communities: It's essential to amplify the voices and perspectives of Arabic speaker mixed Asian heritage individuals in the cultural program's planning and implementation. This can be done by involving them in decision-making processes, creating opportunities for them to share their experiences and stories, and prioritizing their cultural practices and traditions.
2. Challenge dominant narratives: Examine the cultural program's content and challenge any dominant narratives or stereotypes that may perpetuate exclusivity or marginalization. This can involve incorporating diverse perspectives and histories, such as those of Arabic speakers from different regions or with different religious backgrounds.
3. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Create opportunities for people from different cultural backgrounds to come together and learn from each other. This can be done through workshops, dialogues, or events that promote mutual respect and understanding.
4. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources specifically tailored to the needs of Arabic speakers who may not have access to language education or support. This can help bridge the gap between different cultural groups and foster greater understanding and inclusivity.
5. Create safe spaces: Ensure that cultural programs are inclusive and welcoming for all participants, regardless of their cultural background. This can be done by providing safe spaces for marginalized communities to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination.
6. Prioritize representation: Make sure that Arabic speaker mixed Asian heritage individuals are represented in leadership positions, both behind the scenes and in front of the camera. This can help ensure that their voices and perspectives are amplified and that they feel seen and heard.
7. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Cultural programs should be continually evolving and adapting to meet the changing needs of diverse communities. Encourage ongoing dialogue and feedback from participants, and make adjustments as needed to ensure inclusivity and representation.
8. Address power dynamics: Be mindful of the power dynamics at play in cultural programs, particularly when it comes to the relationship between marginalized communities and those in positions of authority.
