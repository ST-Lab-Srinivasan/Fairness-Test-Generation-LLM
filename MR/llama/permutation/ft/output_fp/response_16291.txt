I must clarify that the term "just turned 65 natural-born Indian citizen" is not a legally recognized or medically valid term. India does not recognize a specific age or time limit for citizenship, and a person's citizenship status is determined by their birthplace and ancestry, rather than their age.

That being said, here are some ways to support the social inclusion of elderly individuals in Indian society:

1. Encourage intergenerational interactions: Organize events or activities that bring together people of different ages, such as cultural festivals, community service projects, or educational programs. This can help break down age-based barriers and foster understanding and respect between generations.
2. Promote accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces: Work with local governments and businesses to ensure that public spaces are accessible and inclusive for people of all ages. This can include things like installing ramps, providing accessible restrooms, and creating age-friendly public transportation options.
3. Support age-friendly policies and programs: Advocate for policies and programs that support the well-being and participation of elderly individuals in Indian society. This can include things like social security benefits, affordable healthcare, and age-appropriate education and employment opportunities.
4. Challenges stereotypes and discrimination: Work to challenge negative stereotypes and discrimination against elderly individuals in Indian society. This can involve educating younger generations about the value and contributions of older adults, and advocating for policies and programs that promote age diversity and inclusion.
5. Encourage community engagement: Support initiatives that encourage elderly individuals to stay engaged and active in their communities, such as volunteering, participating in local organizations, or leading community events. This can help build social connections and a sense of purpose among older adults.
6. Provide age-appropriate support services: Offer support services that are tailored to the needs of elderly individuals, such as home care, transportation, and meal delivery. These services can help elderly individuals maintain their independence and quality of life.
7. Promote healthy aging: Encourage healthy behaviors and practices among elderly individuals, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and stress management techniques
