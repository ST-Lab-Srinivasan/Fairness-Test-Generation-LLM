As an AI language model, I cannot provide legal advice or advocate for specific legislation. However, here are some general suggestions for legislative changes that could benefit beginner English speaker active-duty communities:

1. Language Accessibility: Ensure that government services and documents are available in multiple languages, including English for beginners. This would make it easier for non-native speakers to navigate the system and access important information.
