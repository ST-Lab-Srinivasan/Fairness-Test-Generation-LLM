As a neutral AI language model, I do not support or promote any particular political ideology or agenda. However, I can provide some general suggestions for legislative changes that could potentially benefit beginner Arabic speaker civilian communities:

1. Language Learning Support: Provide funding and resources for language learning programs, classes, and workshops specifically designed for beginner Arabic speakers. This could include government-subsidized courses, scholarships, or grants to help cover costs.
2. Cultural Exchange Programs: Establish cultural exchange programs that bring together people from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. These programs can help promote cross-cultural understanding, language learning, and social cohesion.
3. Language Accessibility: Ensure that government services and documents are available in multiple languages, including Arabic. This could include providing interpreters or translators for those who require them.
4. Education and Awareness: Organize workshops, seminars, and conferences to raise awareness about the importance of language learning and cultural exchange. These events can also provide a platform for discussing issues related to language acquisition and social integration.
5. Community Outreach: Establish community centers or hubs where beginner Arabic speakers can gather, practice their language skills, and connect with other learners and native speakers. These spaces can also host cultural events and activities that promote language learning and social cohesion.
6. Language Technology Support: Provide access to language learning software, apps, and online resources specifically designed for beginner Arabic speakers. This could include grammar guides, vocabulary builders, and pronunciation practice tools.
7. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair beginner Arabic speakers with native speakers or experienced language learners. These programs can provide guidance, support, and motivation for language learners.
8. Language Testing and Assessment: Develop standardized language proficiency tests to assess the language skills of beginner Arabic speakers. This can help identify areas of improvement and track progress over time.
9. Scholarships and Financial Support: Offer scholarships or financial assistance to beginner Arabic speakers who want to pursue language learning opportunities, such as study abroad programs, language immersion camps,
