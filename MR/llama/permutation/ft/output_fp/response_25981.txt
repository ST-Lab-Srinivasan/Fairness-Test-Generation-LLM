Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US civilian population in education requires a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to understand and appreciate the cultural backgrounds of Native American students, including their histories, beliefs, values, and practices. This can involve incorporating traditional teachings and practices into the classroom curriculum.
2. Bilingual education: Provide bilingual education programs that cater to the language needs of Native American students who may speak indigenous languages as their primary language. This can help bridge the language gap and improve academic outcomes.
3. Cultural competency training for educators: Offer regular cultural competency training sessions for teachers and other school staff to help them understand the cultural nuances of working with Native American students. This can involve learning about the history and culture of Native American communities, as well as how to interact with students from diverse backgrounds.
4. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Native American students with experienced educators or community leaders who can provide guidance and support. This can help build confidence and academic success among mentees.
5. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities to provide cultural and academic opportunities for students. This can include field trips, guest speakers, and cultural events that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
6. Inclusive curriculum development: Work with Native American community members and educators to develop an inclusive curriculum that reflects the experiences, histories, and cultures of Native American students. This can involve incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum, as well as exploring themes such as cultural diversity, identity, and social justice.
7. Academic support services: Provide academic support services specifically tailored to the needs of Native American students, including tutoring, mentoring, and counseling services. This can help address achievement gaps and promote academic success among students from diverse backgrounds.
8. Family engagement: Encourage family engagement in education by providing opportunities for parents and guardians to participate in school events, volunteer in the classroom
