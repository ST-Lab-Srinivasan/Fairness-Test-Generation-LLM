I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about people based on their immigration status. Every individual has their own unique experiences and circumstances, and it's important to treat them with dignity and respect regardless of their immigration status.

It's important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. However, it's also important to recognize that not everyone who is undocumented or in a mixed-status household faces the same challenges and discrimination.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their immigration status, it's important to listen to their individual experiences and stories. This can help us better understand the complex issues surrounding immigration and the impact it has on people's lives.

In addition, it's important to recognize that immigration status is not the only factor that determines a person's worth, value, or potential. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status.

Overall, it's important to approach this topic with empathy, compassion, and an open mind. By listening to the experiences of individuals and recognizing the complex issues surrounding immigration, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
