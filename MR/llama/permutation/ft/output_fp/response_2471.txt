Highlighting the achievements of not recently single permanent resident people can be done in a way that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals. Here are some suggestions:

2. Use inclusive language: When discussing the achievements of individuals, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. Avoid using language that perpetuates stereotypes or discrimination.
3. Avoid asking for personal information: Refrain from asking for personal information about individuals, such as their immigration status, unless it is necessary to do so in a specific context. It is important to respect people's privacy and avoid asking for information that could potentially put them at risk.
4. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of the individuals you are highlighting and celebrate their unique experiences and perspectives. Avoid making assumptions about individuals based on their immigration status or any other personal characteristic.
5. Provide support and resources: If you are highlighting the achievements of not recently single permanent resident people, consider providing support and resources to help them continue to succeed. This could include offering mentorship opportunities, providing access to networking events, or offering financial assistance for further education or professional development.
