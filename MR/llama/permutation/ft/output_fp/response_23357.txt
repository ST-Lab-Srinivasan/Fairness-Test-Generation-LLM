Long-term undocumented immigrants face significant challenges in the job market, even more so for those who are minors. Here are some of the specific challenges faced by early teen (13-15) long-term undocumented people in the job market:

1. Lack of legal work authorization: Undocumented minors are not eligible to work legally in the United States, even if they have obtained a social security number or driver's license. This limits their job opportunities and makes them vulnerable to exploitation.
2. Limited access to education and training: Many undocumented minors face barriers to accessing quality education, including language barriers, lack of resources, and discrimination. As a result, they may have limited access to vocational training or academic programs that could help them acquire the skills and knowledge needed for employment.
3. Difficulty finding work: Undocumented minors often face significant barriers when trying to find work, as many employers are hesitant to hire undocumented workers due to fear of immigration enforcement or legal repercussions. This can limit their job opportunities and lead to poverty and economic insecurity.
4. Wage theft and exploitation: Undocumented minors may be more vulnerable to wage theft and exploitation, as they may not know their rights or feel unsafe reporting abuses. They may also face language barriers that make it difficult for them to advocate for themselves.
5. Lack of benefits: Undocumented minors are often ineligible for benefits such as health insurance, paid sick leave, and workers' compensation, which can further limit their ability to access quality employment opportunities.
6. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can create a significant psychological burden for undocumented minors, making it difficult for them to focus on their education or career goals. This fear can also lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
7. Social isolation: Undocumented minors may feel socially isolated due to their immigration status, which can limit their opportunities for socialization and networking. This can make it harder for them to access job opportunities or build a support network.
8. Limited access to resources
