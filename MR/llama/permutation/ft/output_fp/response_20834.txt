Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Spanish speaker, ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the community's needs and interests: Conduct research and gather feedback from members of the African American community to understand their cultural preferences and interests. This will help you design programs that are relevant and appealing to them.
2. Involve the community in the programming process: Invite members of the African American community to participate in the planning and development of cultural programs. This can be done through focus groups, surveys, or other forms of community engagement.
3. Offer a range of cultural experiences: Provide a variety of cultural programs that cater to different interests and preferences within the African American community. For example, you could offer events focused on music, dance, art, literature, or history.
4. Ensure representation and inclusion: Make sure that the cultural programs you offer feature diverse voices and perspectives, including those of Native Spanish speakers and other underrepresented groups. This can be done by incorporating their stories, experiences, and cultural practices into the programs.
5. Create opportunities for dialogue and connection: Design programs that facilitate dialogue and connection among members of different racial and ethnic groups. This can be done through events that bring people together to share experiences and learn from one another.
6. Provide accessibility and accommodations: Ensure that your cultural programs are accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities or language barriers. Offer translation services, audio descriptions, or other accommodations as needed.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. Encourage members of the African American community to participate in cultural programs and events, and make them feel a part of the larger cultural landscape.
8. Address historical and systemic barriers: Acknowledge the historical and systemic barriers that have prevented many Native Spanish speakers from fully participating in mainstream cultural institutions. Work towards addressing these barriers through education, advocacy, and community engagement.
9. Develop partnerships and collaborations: Build relationships with organizations and individuals within the African American community to co-create and co-deliver cultural programs. This can help to increase participation and engagement
