Addressing the needs of temporary visa holders, particularly those without children, during a disaster response is crucial to ensure inclusive and equitable aid distribution. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Outreach and awareness campaigns: Conduct targeted outreach and awareness campaigns in communities with high concentrations of temporary visa holders, informing them of the available resources and support during a disaster response.
