I appreciate your willingness to support the mental health of diverse groups, including those with mixed Asian heritage. However, it's important to recognize that mental health is a complex and multifaceted issue that cannot be reduced to simple categorizations or stereotypes. It's also crucial to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or assumptions about any particular racial or ethnic group.

7. Support community-based initiatives:
