Non-conservative Native Spanish speakers may face a number of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who do not speak Spanish fluently, navigating the legal system can be difficult and intimidating. They may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in Spain is based on a civil law tradition, which may differ from the cultural practices and values of non-conservative Native Spanish speakers. For example, some indigenous communities may have their own traditional justice systems that prioritize community reconciliation and healing over punishment or retribution.
3. Lack of representation: Non-conservative Native Spanish speakers may have limited access to legal resources and representation, particularly in rural or remote areas where there may be few lawyers or legal aid organizations available. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
4. Discrimination: Non-conservative Native Spanish speakers may face discrimination or bias within the legal system, particularly if they are from marginalized communities such as racial or ethnic minorities. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of trust in the legal system.
5. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system in Spain may not always take into account the cultural practices and values of non-conservative Native Spanish speakers, which can result in misunderstandings or misinterpretations of their rights and needs. For example, the legal system may not recognize or respect traditional forms of dispute resolution or family law practices that are important to indigenous communities.
6. Limited access to justice: Non-conservative Native Spanish speakers may face barriers to accessing justice, such as lack of transportation or childcare, which can make it difficult for them to attend court hearings or meet legal deadlines.

Lack of knowledge about legal rights: Non-conservative Native Spanish speakers may have limited knowledge about their legal rights and responsibilities, particularly if they are not fluent in Spanish or have limited access to legal resources. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
