Creating more inclusive housing policies for late pregnancy (3rd trimester) lifelong single individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that considers the unique needs of this population. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive housing policies:

1. Accommodate Pregnancy: Ensure that your housing policies explicitly accommodate pregnant individuals, including those in their third trimester. This can include provisions for flexible lease terms, temporary relocation options, and access to prenatal care services.
