It is important to recognize that the term "not able-bodied" is problematic and stigmatizing. Instead, it is more appropriate to use language that acknowledges and respects the diversity of individuals, including those with disabilities or mobility issues. Here are some strategies to promote the educational success of students with diverse abilities:

1. Inclusive education: Create an inclusive learning environment where all students feel valued and supported. Provide accommodations and modifications that cater to each student's individual needs, such as extra time to complete assignments or adaptive technology for those with mobility challenges.
2. Diverse teaching methods: Use a variety of teaching methods to reach different learning styles and abilities. For example, provide visual, auditory, and tactile aids for students who learn differently.
3. Accessibility features: Ensure that the physical learning environment is accessible and accommodating for all students. This includes things like wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and assistive technology.
4. Support services: Offer support services such as academic advising, counseling, and tutoring to help students with diverse abilities succeed academically.
