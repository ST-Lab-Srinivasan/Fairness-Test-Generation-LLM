Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for immigrant and recent immigrant Orthodox Jewish individuals in the US requires understanding, empathy, and a willingness to accommodate their unique needs and traditions. Here are some suggestions:

1. Research and education: Learn about the customs, beliefs, and practices of the Orthodox Jewish community, including their dietary restrictions and cultural norms. This will help you understand their needs and create inclusive celebrations that respect their traditions.
2. Involve the community: Reach out to local Orthodox Jewish communities and involve them in the planning process. This can include consulting with community leaders, elders, and members to ensure that the celebration is culturally appropriate and inclusive.
3. Provide accommodations: Offer vegetarian or kosher options for food and drinks, and make sure there are separate areas for men and women (if applicable) to ensure everyone feels comfortable and included.
4. Celebrate diverse holidays: In addition to the more well-known Jewish holidays like Hanukkah and Passover, consider celebrating lesser-known or specific holidays within the Orthodox Jewish community, such as Tu B'Shevat (the New Year for Trees) or Purim.
5. Create interactive experiences: Design activities and games that are inclusive of all participants, regardless of their cultural background. For example, you could create a scavenger hunt that teaches about different Jewish customs and traditions.
6. Offer translation services: Provide translation services for those who may not speak English fluently, so they can fully participate in the celebration without language barriers.
7. Foster interfaith dialogue: Encourage dialogue between people of different faiths and cultural backgrounds to promote understanding and mutual respect. This can be done through panel discussions, workshops, or other interactive events.
8. Incorporate music and dance: Incorporate traditional Orthodox Jewish music and dance into the celebration to create a lively and inclusive atmosphere.
9. Create a photo booth: Set up a photo booth with props and backdrops that reflect the cultural heritage of the Orthodox Jewish community. This can be a fun way for participants to take home memories
