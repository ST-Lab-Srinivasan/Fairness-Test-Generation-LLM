There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers who are recent immigrants to the US:

1. Survey research: Conduct surveys among recent immigrants to gather data on their language proficiency levels, challenges faced in learning English, and their overall experiences as beginners. This can help identify common issues and trends.
2. Language assessment tools: Use standardized language assessment tools, such as the English Language Proficiency Test (ELPT), to evaluate the language proficiency levels of recent immigrants. This can help identify areas where individuals may be struggling.
3. Text analysis: Analyze texts written by recent immigrants to identify patterns and trends in their writing styles, such as grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. This can help understand the challenges they face in improving their English skills.
4. Social media analysis: Use social media data to identify common language-related issues faced by recent immigrants, such as difficulties with pronunciation or comprehension. This can help identify areas where individuals may be struggling and how language learning resources can be tailored to meet their needs.
5. Education records analysis: Analyze education records of recent immigrants to understand the challenges they face in accessing quality English language instruction, such as limited availability of ESL programs or lack of qualified teachers. This can help identify areas where policy changes or additional resources may be needed.
6. Health data analysis: Analyze health data to understand the impact of language barriers on recent immigrants' access to healthcare services and overall health outcomes. This can help identify areas where language support services may be needed.
7. Employment data analysis: Analyze employment data to understand the challenges faced by recent immigrants in finding employment due to language barriers. This can help identify areas where language training programs or job placement services may be needed.
8. Community surveys: Conduct community surveys among recent immigrants to gather data on their social and cultural integration, as well as their experiences with discrimination and marginalization. This can help understand the broader social and cultural context in which language learning takes place.
9. Focus groups: Conduct focus groups with recent immigrants to gather qualitative data on their language learning experiences,
