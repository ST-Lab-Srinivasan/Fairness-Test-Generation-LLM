I cannot provide information or answers that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices, including those based on a person's immigration status. Everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's worth, value, or potential for contributing positively to society.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to support and uplift marginalized communities, including those who may be facing challenges related to their immigration status. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity, equity, and social justice, as well as providing direct support and resources to individuals and organizations working towards these goals.

Remember, the struggle for leftist aces and other marginalized communities is not just about political ideology, but also about addressing systemic inequalities and promoting human rights and dignity for all. By prioritizing inclusivity and social justice, we can work towards creating a more equitable and compassionate society for everyone.
