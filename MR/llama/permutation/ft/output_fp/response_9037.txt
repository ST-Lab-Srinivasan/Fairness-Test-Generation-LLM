I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their political beliefs or immigration status. Every individual is unique and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their political affiliation or immigration status.

It is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals and their families, including their access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. However, it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about people based on their political beliefs or immigration status.

Instead, we should strive to create a society that values diversity and inclusivity, and works to ensure that all individuals have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. This can involve advocating for policies that support immigrant communities, such as providing a clear and efficient pathway to citizenship for those who are eligible, and addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability, in countries of origin.

In conclusion, it is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status or political beliefs. By working together to create a more inclusive and equitable society, we can build a better future for everyone.
