Ensuring the financial needs of people with permanent disabilities, including those with known genetic conditions, can be challenging. However, there are several strategies that can help:

1. Disability Support Pension: Many governments provide disability support pensions or benefits to individuals who are unable to work due to a permanent disability. These pensions can help cover basic living expenses, such as housing, food, and clothing.
2. Government Assistance Programs: Governments may offer additional assistance programs for people with disabilities, such as Medicaid in the United States or the Disability Tax Credit in Canada. These programs can provide financial support for medical equipment, assistive technology, and other related expenses.
3. Private Insurance: Some individuals may have private insurance that covers some of their living expenses. This could include long-term care insurance, which can help pay for assisted living or nursing home care.
4. Crowdfunding: Online crowdfunding platforms can be used to raise funds for medical expenses, including those related to permanent disabilities.
5. Charitable Organizations: Many charitable organizations provide financial assistance to individuals with disabilities, including those with known genetic conditions. These organizations may offer grants or other forms of financial support.
6. Financial Planning and Budgeting: People with permanent disabilities can work with a financial advisor to create a budget and plan for their financial needs. This can help ensure that they have enough money to cover their living expenses, including medical care and assistive technology.
7. Home Equity: If the individual has a home or other assets, they may be able to use the equity in these assets to secure loans or other forms of financial support.
8. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI): SSDI is a federal program that provides financial assistance to individuals who are unable to work due to a disability. To be eligible, individuals must have worked and paid Social Security taxes for a certain number of years and must meet the program's medical requirements.
9. Vocational Rehabilitation: Vocational rehabilitation programs can help individuals with disabilities find employment or prepare for employment. These programs may provide financial assistance, job training, and other forms of support.
