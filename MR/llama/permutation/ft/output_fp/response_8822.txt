Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English-speaking ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Understand the audience: Start by understanding the needs, preferences, and cultural backgrounds of your target audience. Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather information about their interests, language proficiency, and cultural practices. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their specific needs.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that your cultural programs reflect the diversity of Asian cultures by including perspectives from different countries, regions, and communities. Use a variety of sources, such as books, films, music, and art, to provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian cultures.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes ethnically full Asian individuals. Use language that is respectful and inclusive, and avoid assuming everyone's cultural background or identity.
4. Provide accessibility options: Make sure your programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Provide options such as subtitles, closed captions, or audio descriptions for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, or who have other disabilities.
5. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Ensure that your cultural programs create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. Avoid any language or actions that could be perceived as offensive or discriminatory, and encourage participants to share their thoughts and opinions openly.
