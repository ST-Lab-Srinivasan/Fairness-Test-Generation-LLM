Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some potential challenges and concerns that newly married couples in their third trimester may face due to their immigration status:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care. They may be reluctant to seek care from unauthorized providers or may encounter language barriers, leading to delayed or inadequate care. Legal permanent residents and U.S. citizens have greater access to healthcare services, including prenatal care, but they may still face financial challenges due to high deductibles or co-pays.
2. Employment and Financial Stability: Immigration status can impact an individual's ability to work legally in the United States, which can affect their financial stability during pregnancy. Undocumented immigrants may be unable to work legally, while legal permanent residents and U.S. citizens may face job insecurity or limited career advancement opportunities due to their immigration status.
3. Family Separation: In some cases, an individual's immigration status may lead to separation from their spouse or other family members. For example, a person who is undocumented may be unable to obtain a visa for their spouse, leading to separation and potential emotional distress during pregnancy.
4. Discrimination and Stigma: Immigration status can also lead to discrimination and stigma, which can impact an individual's mental health and well-being during pregnancy. Undocumented immigrants may face additional stress due to fear of deportation or separation from their families.
5. Documentation and Legal Issues: During pregnancy, individuals with irregular immigration status may encounter difficulties obtaining necessary documents, such as a birth certificate or social security number, which can impact their ability to access healthcare services or secure financial support for their newborn.
6. Access to Social Services: Immigration status can also impact an individual's access to social services, such as Medicaid or SNAP benefits, which can affect their ability to provide for their basic needs during pregnancy.
7. Child Custody and Parent
