Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the needs of various groups, including those living below the poverty line and those who are not lifelong singles. Here are some strategies to create more inclusive policies:

1. Listen to diverse voices: Involve marginalized communities in policy-making processes to ensure their perspectives and experiences are taken into account. This can be done through community consultations, focus groups, or participatory research methods.
2. Address intersectionality: Recognize that individuals have multiple identities (e.g., race, gender, sexuality) that intersect and impact their experiences of poverty and social isolation. Policies should take into account the intersections of oppression and address them simultaneously.
3. Foster community connections: Encourage social connections and mutual support within communities through initiatives such as community gardens, volunteer programs, or cooperative housing projects. This can help build resilience and reduce feelings of isolation.
4. Provide affordable housing options: Ensure that there are affordable and accessible housing options available to all, including those living below the poverty line. This can involve subsidies, rent control measures, or community land trusts.
5. Implement progressive taxation: Implement a tax system that redistributes wealth and resources from the rich to the poor, reducing economic inequality and providing more resources for social programs.
6. Invest in education and job training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs, particularly for those living below the poverty line, to help them acquire skills and improve their socio-economic status.
7. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from accessing resources and opportunities, such as discrimination, lack of access to healthcare, or inadequate infrastructure.
8. Support caregiving roles: Recognize the importance of caregiving roles, particularly for those who are not lifelong singles, by providing support and resources for caregivers, such as respite care, financial assistance, or social support networks.
9. Promote social safety nets: Establish and maintain comprehensive social safety nets that provide a minimum level of well-being to all individuals, regardless
