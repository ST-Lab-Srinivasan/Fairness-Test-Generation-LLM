The impact of political affiliation on the lives of Mandarin-speaking late teenagers (ages 18-19) can be significant, as it can shape their beliefs, values, and behaviors. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Identity formation: Political affiliation can play a role in shaping the identity of young people, particularly during this age range. As they explore their political views, they may find that they align more closely with one party or another, which can help them develop a sense of self and belonging.
2. Access to opportunities: In China, political affiliation can influence access to educational and career opportunities.
