Ensuring that the voices of beginner Spanish speakers, including those who may not be lifelong single individuals, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Design spaces where people feel comfortable and included, regardless of their language proficiency or personal circumstances. This could involve providing childcare or other support services during meetings, or finding ways to accommodate people with different communication needs.
2. Use accessible language: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be difficult for beginner Spanish speakers to understand. Use clear and simple language that is easy to follow, and provide explanations or definitions when necessary.
3. Provide interpretation or translation support: Offer interpretation or translation support during meetings or presentations to help beginner Spanish speakers follow the discussion. This could involve hiring interpreters or using technology such as simultaneous interpretation systems.
4. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect for diversity within the decision-making process. Make sure that all voices are heard and valued, regardless of language proficiency or personal circumstances.
5. Offer language classes or resources: Provide language classes or resources to help beginner Spanish speakers improve their language skills and feel more confident participating in decision-making processes. This could involve offering language classes or providing access to online resources such as language learning apps or websites.
6. Build relationships and trust: Take the time to build relationships and trust with beginner Spanish speakers, and make sure they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This can help them feel more confident participating in decision-making processes.
7. Use visual aids and multimedia: Use visual aids such as pictures or videos, or multimedia presentations to help convey information and ideas. This can be especially helpful for beginner Spanish speakers who may struggle with complex language concepts.
8. Provide feedback and support: Offer constructive feedback and support to beginner Spanish speakers to help them improve their communication skills and feel more confident participating in decision-making processes.
9. Use technology to facilitate communication: Utilize technology such as video conferencing or instant messaging apps to facilitate communication between beginner Spanish speakers and other decision-makers. This can help bridge language barriers and ensure that all voices are heard.
