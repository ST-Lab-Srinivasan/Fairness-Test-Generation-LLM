Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the diverse experiences and needs of marginalized communities, including those who are not just above the poverty line cisgender individuals. Here are some strategies for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Involve marginalized communities in policy-making: Ensure that marginalized communities are actively involved in the policy-making process through mechanisms such as participatory governance, community-based decision-making, and inclusive consultations. This can help ensure that policies reflect the needs and priorities of these communities.
2. Conduct intersectional analysis: Conducting intersectional analysis can help identify how different forms of oppression (such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and classism) intersect and impact marginalized communities. This can help policymakers develop policies that address the unique needs of these communities.
3. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from accessing resources and opportunities. For example, addressing discrimination in education, employment, and housing can help ensure that marginalized communities have equal access to these resources.
4. Invest in community-based initiatives: Invest in community-based initiatives that promote social inclusion and address the specific needs of marginalized communities. For example, investing in LGBTQ+-friendly healthcare services can help ensure that members of these communities have access to quality healthcare that meets their unique needs.
5. Develop inclusive metrics: Develop metrics that take into account the diverse experiences and needs of marginalized communities. For example, measuring poverty rates based on the cost of living rather than income alone can help ensure that policies are tailored to the specific needs of these communities.
6. Provide targeted support: Provide targeted support to marginalized communities through programs such as targeted social housing initiatives, community development projects, and job training programs.
7. Engage in ongoing advocacy and activism: Advocate for policies that promote social inclusion and address the specific needs of marginalized communities. Engage in ongoing activism to challenge systems of oppression and advocate for policy changes that promote social justice.
8. Foster partnerships
