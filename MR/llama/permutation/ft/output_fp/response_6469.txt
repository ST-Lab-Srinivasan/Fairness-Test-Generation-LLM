Creating more inclusive recreational activities for active-duty devout Christians can be achieved by considering their beliefs and values while designing the activities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate religious elements: Consider incorporating religious elements into recreational activities, such as Bible study groups, prayer sessions, or worship services. This will provide a sense of community and spiritual fulfillment for active-duty devout Christians.
2. Provide flexible scheduling: Many active-duty Christian service members have busy schedules and may find it challenging to participate in recreational activities during traditional hours. Offer activities at non-traditional times, such as early mornings or evenings, to accommodate their schedules.
3. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of recreational activities that cater to different interests and preferences, such as sports, fitness classes, art and craft sessions, or board game nights. This will ensure that there is something for everyone, regardless of their interests or abilities.
4. Ensure accessibility: Make sure that the recreational activities are accessible to all active-duty devout Christians, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
5. Be sensitive to dietary restrictions: Many active-duty Christian service members have specific dietary requirements due to their religious beliefs. Ensure that food and drinks provided during recreational activities are in line with these restrictions.
6. Create a safe space: Designate areas where active-duty devout Christians can feel safe and comfortable expressing their faith without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could be as simple as designating a quiet room for prayer or meditation.
7. Involve them in the planning process: Encourage active-duty devout Christians to participate in the planning process for recreational activities. This will give them a sense of ownership and involvement, which can help create more inclusive and fulfilling activities.
8. Provide spiritual guidance: Offer spiritual guidance and support to active-duty devout Christians through counseling services or religious advisors. This can help them navigate the challenges of military life while
