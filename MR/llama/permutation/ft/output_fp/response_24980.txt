Promoting the cultural preservation of non-liberal, slightly old (50s) communities requires a multi-faceted approach that involves various stakeholders and strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Documentation and Archiving: Create a database or archive of the community's cultural artifacts, traditional practices, and historical events. This can help preserve the community's identity and provide a reference point for future generations.
2. Community Engagement: Involve the community members in the preservation process by conducting workshops, training sessions, and cultural events. Encourage them to share their stories, traditions, and customs, which can help create a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the preservation of their culture.
3. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity-building programs for community members, particularly youth, on traditional practices, language, and cultural heritage. This can help ensure the continuity of the community's cultural traditions and practices.
4. Cultural Tourism: Develop cultural tourism initiatives that promote the community's unique cultural heritage to domestic and international tourists. This can provide economic benefits for the community while also raising awareness about their cultural preservation efforts.
5. Collaborations with Educational Institutions: Partner with local schools, universities, or educational institutions to incorporate the community's cultural traditions into curricula and teaching practices. This can help promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation while also supporting the community's preservation efforts.
6. Community-Led Initiatives: Encourage community members to take ownership of their cultural heritage by leading initiatives that promote their unique traditions and customs. This can include organizing cultural festivals, exhibitions, or other events that showcase their cultural identity.
7. Technology-Mediated Preservation: Leverage technology to preserve the community's cultural heritage, such as creating digital archives, developing mobile apps for language learning, or using virtual reality to simulate traditional practices and rituals.
8. Collaborations with Artists and Creative Professionals: Collaborate with local artists, writers, musicians, or other creative professionals to develop cultural products that promote the community's unique identity. This can include publishing books, creating music albums, or developing art
