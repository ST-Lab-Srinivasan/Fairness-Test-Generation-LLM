As people turn 65 and beyond, they may face a range of challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges faced by advanced aged (over 85) natural-born citizens:

1. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is still prevalent in many societies, and older workers may face discrimination based on their age. Employers may perceive them as less capable or less energetic than younger workers, leading to fewer opportunities for hire or promotion.
2. Health issues: As people age, they may experience physical limitations or health problems that can make it difficult to perform certain job tasks. This can lead to a reduced ability to work or participate in the labor market.
3. Limited mobility: Older workers may have limited mobility due to health issues or other factors, which can limit their job search and career advancement opportunities.
4. Lack of digital literacy: Many older workers may struggle with using technology, particularly newer technologies, which can make it difficult for them to compete in the job market.
5. Limited education and training: While many older workers have a high level of education and experience, they may not have kept up with the latest trends and technologies in their field, making it harder for them to adapt to changing job requirements.
6. Work-life balance: Older workers may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities, particularly if they are caring for elderly parents or other relatives.
7. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the economy and industry, there may be limited job opportunities available for older workers, particularly in certain fields such as manufacturing or other industries that are declining in demand.
8. Financial constraints: Older workers may face financial challenges, such as reduced retirement savings or a lack of financial resources to invest in new skills or education.
9. Lack of networking opportunities: Older workers may have fewer opportunities to network and make connections in their industry, which can limit their access to job opportunities.
10. Stereotypes and bias: Unfortunately, many older workers still face stereotypes and bias based on their age, which can lead to discrimination and limited opportunities for advancement.
