The impact of disability status on the lives of temporary visa holders who are separated from their families can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Emotional Distress: The separation can cause significant emotional distress, particularly for individuals with disabilities who may face additional challenges in navigating a new environment without their loved ones by their side.
