This may involve hosting workshops, creating educational materials, or leveraging media platforms to raise awareness.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Addressing systemic barriers and discrimination requires advocating for policies that promote inclusivity and accessibility. This could involve lobbying for legislative changes, collaborating
