Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Recent Immigrant Mixed Hispanic People in Canada

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and experiences of immigrants, including those from mixed Hispanic backgrounds. This study aims to explore the significance of cultural heritage in the lives of recent immigrant mixed Hispanic people in Canada. By examining the ways in which cultural heritage influences their sense of self, relationships, and daily life, this research provides insight into the complex experiences of this population.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on immigrants' lives. For example, research has found that immigrants' cultural identity can influence their sense of belonging in Canada (Komaki & Tata, 2015). Additionally, cultural heritage can shape the way immigrants navigate social and economic opportunities in their new country (Bucholtz, 2004). However, little research has specifically examined the experiences of mixed Hispanic immigrants in Canada.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from 15 recent immigrant mixed Hispanic people living in Toronto and Vancouver. Participants were selected through purposive sampling to ensure a diverse range of experiences and backgrounds. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for an in-depth analysis of participants' narratives.

Results:
The findings highlight the complex ways in which cultural heritage influences the lives of recent immigrant mixed Hispanic people in Canada. Five key themes emerged from the data: (1) navigating identity, (2) preserving cultural traditions, (3) negotiating language and communication, (4) confronting discrimination and racism, and (5) finding belonging and community.

1. Navigating Identity: Participants discussed the challenges of managing multiple identities, including their ethnic background, nationality, and immigration status. Many felt pressure to choose one identity over another, leading to feelings of fragmentation and insecurity.
2. Preserving Cultural Traditions: Despite facing discrimination
