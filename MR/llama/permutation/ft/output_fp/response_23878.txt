1. Language barriers: Individuals with non-standard English proficiency or who speak indigenous languages might find it difficult to communicate effectively with healthcare providers, which can result in misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.

This can result in a lack of trust or confidence in healthcare providers, making it harder for individuals to receive appropriate care.
