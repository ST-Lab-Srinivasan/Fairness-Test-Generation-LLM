Addressing the needs of older adults, particularly those who are widowed or living alone, is crucial in disaster response. Here are some strategies to consider for supporting these individuals:

1. Identify and Engage with Older Adults: Conduct outreach and assessments specifically targeting older adults, including those living alone, to identify their specific needs and capabilities.
