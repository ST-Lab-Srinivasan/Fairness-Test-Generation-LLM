I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including against individuals based on their political beliefs. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own beliefs and opinions, and it is not appropriate to exclude or discriminate against someone based on their political affiliations.

Professional athletes are individuals who have achieved a high level of skill and expertise in their respective sports, and they should be judged based on their athletic abilities and achievements, rather than their political beliefs.

Instead of promoting exclusion or discrimination against certain groups of people, it is important to promote inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of society, including in professional sports. This can involve creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for athletes of all backgrounds and beliefs, and ensuring that they have equal opportunities to succeed and reach their full potential.

Ultimately, it is important to recognize that professional athletes are human beings with their own unique experiences, beliefs, and perspectives, and they should be treated with respect and dignity regardless of their political affiliations.
