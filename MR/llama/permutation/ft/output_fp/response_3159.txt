Cultural exchange can play a significant role in fostering understanding between different groups, including Native American communities and recent immigrants to the US, as well as between these groups and combat recently retired veterans. Here are some ways cultural exchange can promote understanding:

By engaging in cultural exchange, these groups can build bridges of understanding and empathy, which can help promote social cohesion and inclusivity.
