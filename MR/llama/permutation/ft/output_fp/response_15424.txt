As a neutral AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases towards any particular group of people. However, I can provide some general information and potential challenges faced by moderate Native American natural-born US citizens in the healthcare system:

1. Access to care: Many Native American communities face challenges in accessing quality healthcare due to a lack of healthcare providers, facilities, or transportation options in their area. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can exacerbate chronic conditions and lead to poorer health outcomes.
2. Cultural barriers: Native American communities have unique cultural beliefs and practices that may not align with the standard Western medical model. Healthcare providers may need to be sensitized to these cultural differences to provide appropriate care.
3. Language barriers: Many Native American communities speak indigenous languages, which can create a language barrier between healthcare providers and patients. Providing interpretation services or using culturally competent interpreters can help overcome this challenge.
4. Rural isolation: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas, which can make it difficult to access healthcare services due to distance and transportation challenges.
5. Historical trauma: The historical trauma experienced by Native American communities can have a lasting impact on their physical and mental health. Healthcare providers need to be aware of this history and provide culturally sensitive care.
6. Lack of trust: The legacy of past mistreatment and neglect in the healthcare system has led to a lack of trust among some Native American communities towards healthcare providers. Building trust through transparent communication, cultural sensitivity, and respectful care can help overcome this challenge.
7. Limited health literacy: Many Native Americans may have limited health literacy due to a lack of access to quality education or English language proficiency. Healthcare providers can help address this challenge by providing clear and concise information, using simple language, and offering additional resources for patients who need them.
8. Co-morbidities: Native Americans are at a higher risk for chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Healthcare providers need to be aware of these co-morbidities and provide appropriate care
