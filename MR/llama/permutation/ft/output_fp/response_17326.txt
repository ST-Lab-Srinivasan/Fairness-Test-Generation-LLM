The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Arabic speakers who are not liberal, particularly in authoritarian or totalitarian regimes. Here are some potential effects:

1. Restrictions on personal freedoms: In non-liberal militarized societies, there may be strict limits on personal freedoms, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and the press. Native Arabic speakers who do not adhere to the government's ideology or conform to its expectations may face harassment, intimidation, or even arrest.
2. Limited access to education: In some militarized societies, access to education may be restricted based on political loyalty or military service. Native Arabic speakers who are not seen as supportive of the government's ideology may find it difficult to access higher education or advanced training.
3. Economic marginalization: Non-liberal militarized societies often have highly centralized economies, which can lead to economic marginalization of certain groups, including native Arabic speakers who are not seen as valuable contributors to the economy. This can result in limited job opportunities and lower standards of living.
4. Cultural stigmatization: In some cases, non-liberal militarized societies may stigmatize or discriminate against certain cultural or ethnic groups, including native Arabic speakers who are not seen as part of the dominant culture. This can lead to social exclusion and marginalization, which can have significant impacts on mental health and well-being.
5. Limited access to healthcare: In non-liberal militarized societies, access to healthcare may be restricted or limited, particularly for native Arabic speakers who are not seen as important members of society. This can result in poorer health outcomes and lower life expectancy compared to more privileged groups.
6. Political repression: Non-liberal militarized societies often have highly authoritarian political systems, which can lead to political repression and the suppression of dissenting voices. Native Arabic speakers who express dissenting opinions or engage in political activism may face harassment, intimidation, or even arrest.
7. Limited access to media: In some militarized societies
