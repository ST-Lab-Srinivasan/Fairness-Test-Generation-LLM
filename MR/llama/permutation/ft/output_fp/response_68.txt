Creating more inclusive social policies for elite ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of elite ex-spouses: The first step is to recognize that elite ex-spouses exist and deserve attention and support. This can involve collecting data on the prevalence of elite ex-spouses and raising awareness about their experiences.
2. Address the stigma associated with divorce: Many elite ex-spouses face social stigma and discrimination due to their marital status. Policies should aim to reduce this stigma by promoting a culture of acceptance and inclusivity.
3. Provide financial support: Elite ex-spouses often face significant financial challenges after divorce, including loss of assets, reduced income, and high maintenance costs. Policies can provide financial assistance, such as alimony or spousal support, to help them maintain their standard of living.
4. Offer professional support: Elite ex-spouses may struggle with mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and trauma, due to the emotional toll of divorce. Policies can provide access to mental health professionals and counseling services to help them cope with these challenges.
5. Advocate for flexible work arrangements: Elite ex-spouses may need flexibility in their work schedules to accommodate childcare responsibilities or other personal obligations. Policies can promote flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or compressed workweeks, to help them balance their professional and personal lives.
6. Promote access to education and training: Many elite ex-spouses may need to acquire new skills or knowledge to adapt to their new circumstances. Policies can provide access to educational resources, such as courses, certifications, or degree programs, to help them improve their employability.
7. Address the needs of marginalized groups: Elite ex-spouses who belong to marginalized communities (e.g., racial or ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals) may face additional barriers and discrimination. Policies should aim to address these disparities
