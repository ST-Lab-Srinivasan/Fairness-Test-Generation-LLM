Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US as civilian individuals in college requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique cultural, social, and economic experiences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural sensitivity training for faculty and staff: Provide training on the history, traditions, and cultural practices of Native American communities to help faculty and staff understand the needs and experiences of these students.
2. Recruitment and retention initiatives: Develop targeted recruitment strategies to attract more Native American students to your institution, and provide support services to help them navigate the college experience. Offer mentorship programs, academic advising, and financial aid to ensure their success.
3. Indigenous-centered curriculum: Incorporate Indigenous perspectives, histories, and cultures into course content to make it more relevant and meaningful for Native American students. Encourage cross-cultural dialogue and collaboration between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students.
4. Community engagement and partnerships: Foster relationships with local Native American communities and organizations to provide opportunities for cultural exchange, internships, and community service projects. This can help Native American students feel connected to their heritage and culture while also gaining valuable experience in their field of study.
5. Support services and resources: Provide dedicated resources and support services, such as a Native American student organization, cultural events, and mental health counseling tailored to the unique needs of Indigenous students. Offer language classes or other resources that can help them navigate the college environment.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policy changes at the institutional level to address systemic barriers and biases faced by Native American students, such as inadequate funding, lack of representation, or cultural insensitivity in curriculum design. Work with tribal governments and organizations to influence policy changes that benefit Native American students.
7. Collaboration with Indigenous-serving institutions: Develop partnerships with Indigenous-serving institutions, such as Tribal Colleges and Universities, to share best practices, resources, and expertise in serving Native American students. This can help create a more comprehensive support system for these students.
