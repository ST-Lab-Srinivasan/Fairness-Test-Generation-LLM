Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty recent immigrants to Canada can be done by considering the following strategies:

1. Language Support: Provide translation services or bilingual event materials to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the event's content.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible for people with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
3. Cultural Awareness: Be mindful of cultural differences and customs when planning the event. For example, avoid scheduling events during sensitive cultural holidays or times of day that may conflict with religious practices.
4. Marketing Strategies: Use multiple marketing channels to reach a diverse audience, such as social media, flyers in different languages, and community centers that cater to immigrant populations.
5. Inclusive Programming: Offer programs that cater to the unique needs and interests of recent immigrants, such as language classes, job training, or cultural orientation sessions.
6. Volunteer Support: Recruit volunteers from diverse backgrounds to help plan and execute the event, providing a sense of belonging and ownership for marginalized communities.
7. Accessible Food Options: Provide food options that cater to diverse dietary needs and preferences, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options.
8. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow attendees to engage with each other and the event's content, such as group discussions, games, or workshops.
9. Technology Integration: Leverage technology to enhance the event experience, such as live streaming or online resources for those who cannot attend in person.
10. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from attendees and make improvements for future events based on their suggestions.

By incorporating these strategies, community event organizers can create a more inclusive environment for active-duty recent immigrants to Canada, fostering a sense of belonging and engagement among this diverse population.
