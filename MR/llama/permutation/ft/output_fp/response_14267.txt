Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty service members and veterans seeking employment requires careful planning and execution. Here are some strategies to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair-accessible, has plenty of parking, and is located near public transportation. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Marketing: Use inclusive language in your marketing materials, such as "active-duty service members and veterans" instead of "veterans only." Advertise the event on military bases, VA hospitals, and other locations popular with veterans.
3. Programming: Offer a variety of workshops and resources tailored to the needs of active-duty service members and veterans. These could include resume building, job search strategies, networking opportunities, and career counseling.
4. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support military personnel, such as the USO or Disabled American Veterans. These partnerships can help reach a wider audience and provide additional resources for attendees.
5. Support Services: Provide on-site childcare, transportation assistance, and other support services to help attendees overcome barriers to employment. This could include job training programs, financial planning workshops, and mental health resources.
6. Networking: Create opportunities for active-duty service members and veterans to connect with potential employers, mentors, and peers. This can be done through speed networking events, roundtable discussions, or networking mixers.
7. Technology: Utilize technology to make the event more accessible, such as live streaming or virtual job fairs. This can help attendees who may have difficulty attending an in-person event due to distance, childcare responsibilities, or other factors.
8. Accessibility resources: Provide accessibility resources such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, and Braille materials for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision.
9. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communication materials, including event flyers
