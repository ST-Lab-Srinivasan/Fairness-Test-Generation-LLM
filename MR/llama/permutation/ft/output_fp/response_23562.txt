Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-binary individuals requires intentional effort and understanding. Here are some suggestions to ensure your event is welcoming and inclusive:

1. Avoid gendered language and imagery: Use language that is inclusive of all genders, and avoid using gendered terms or images that might be alienating for non-binary individuals. For example, instead of referring to a "guest speaker," use "featured artist" or "presenter."
2. Offer gender-neutral bathrooms: Provide access to bathrooms that are safe and comfortable for all attendees, regardless of their gender identity. This can help create a more inclusive environment for non-binary individuals.
3. Use pronouns intentionally: Make an effort to use the correct pronouns for each speaker or performer, and encourage attendees to do the same. Provide pronoun cards or signage as a reminder.
4. Incorporate non-binary voices: Ensure that your event includes a diverse range of perspectives by inviting non-binary speakers or performers. This can help create a more inclusive and representative atmosphere.
5. Be mindful of dress code policies: Avoid enforcing gendered dress codes or expectations, and instead encourage attendees to wear what makes them feel comfortable and confident.
6. Provide gender-neutral options: Offer food and drink options that are inclusive of all genders, such as non-binary or genderqueer individuals.
7. Create a safe space policy: Develop a clear policy for handling conflicts or incidents related to gender identity, and ensure that attendees know how to report any issues.
8. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about non-binary identities and experiences, and share that knowledge with others involved in the event. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and avoid unintentional offenses.
9. Encourage participation: Make sure your event includes interactive elements that encourage participation from all attendees, regardless of gender identity.
10. Be open to feedback: Listen to feedback from non-binary individuals and make adjustments as needed to ensure the event is inclusive and welcoming for everyone.
