Creating more inclusive cultural events for active-duty individuals who are not widowed requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Understand the needs of active-duty individuals: Conduct research or gather input from active-duty individuals to understand their specific needs, preferences, and challenges. This will help you tailor your events to meet their requirements.
2. Provide clear communication: Ensure that all event materials, including invitations, programs, and signage, are in plain language and free of jargon or technical terms that might be unfamiliar to active-duty individuals. Offer accommodations such as large print or Braille upon request.
3. Offer accessible venues: Choose event locations that are wheelchair-accessible, have ample parking, and offer easy access to public transportation. Consider the physical abilities of your guests when selecting a venue.
4. Design inclusive activities: Incorporate activities that cater to various interests and abilities, such as art exhibits, concerts, or cultural workshops. Provide options for active-duty individuals who may have difficulty participating in certain activities due to their military duties or disabilities.
5. Recruit diverse performers and artists: Showcase talents from various backgrounds and abilities to create a more inclusive atmosphere. This could include individuals with disabilities, LGBTQ+ artists, or cultural performers from underrepresented communities.
6. Provide accessible seating and viewing areas: Ensure that there are adequate seating areas for guests who may need additional support or have mobility issues. Consider providing reserved seating areas for individuals with disabilities or offering wheelchair-accessible seating.
7. Offer ASL interpretation or closed captioning: Provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation or closed captioning for cultural events that include music, dance, or theater performances to accommodate guests who are deaf or hard of hearing.
8. Encourage volunteer involvement: Recruit volunteers from diverse backgrounds to help with event setup, greeting guests, and providing support during the event. This can help create a welcoming atmosphere and ensure that all guests feel included.
