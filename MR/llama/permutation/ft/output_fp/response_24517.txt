I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about a person's identity or experiences based on their political beliefs or affiliations. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or political views. It is important to recognize that the LGBTQ+ community is diverse and inclusive, and that individuals within this community have a wide range of experiences and perspectives.

It is also important to acknowledge that discrimination and marginalization can affect individuals in different ways, regardless of their immigration status or political beliefs. For example, LGBTQ+ individuals who are undocumented or have other forms of marginalization may face additional barriers and challenges in their daily lives.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their political beliefs or immigration status, it is important to recognize and respect the diversity and individuality of all people. This can involve listening to and learning from the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect, and working to break down barriers and discrimination in all its forms.
