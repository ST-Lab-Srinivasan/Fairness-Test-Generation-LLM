Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who have recently gone through a divorce, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginner English speakers. This will help them improve their language skills and become more confident in expressing themselves.
2. Use visual aids: Incorporate visual aids such as pictures, videos, or diagrams to help beginners communicate their ideas. This can be especially helpful for those who struggle with verbal communication.
3. Encourage participation: Create a safe and inclusive environment where beginners feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Encourage them to participate in decision-making processes by asking for their input and valuing their perspectives.
4. Simplify language: Use simple language and avoid jargon or technical terms that may be difficult for beginners to understand. This will help ensure that everyone can participate and contribute meaningfully.
5. Build trust: Establish relationships with beginner English speakers by showing empathy, patience, and respect. By building trust, they will be more likely to share their thoughts and opinions in decision-making processes.
6. Use interpreters or translators: If necessary, use interpreters or translators to facilitate communication between beginners and those who are more proficient in English. This can help ensure that everyone's voice is heard equally.
7. Foster a supportive community: Create a supportive community where beginner English speakers feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This can involve providing emotional support, as well as practical assistance with language learning and communication.
8. Encourage peer-to-peer support: Pair beginners with more proficient English speakers who can provide guidance and support. This can help build confidence and encourage participation in decision-making processes.
9. Provide feedback and encouragement: Offer constructive feedback and encouragement to beginner English speakers, helping them improve their language skills and confidence in communicating their ideas.
10. Be patient and flexible: Be patient and flexible when working with beginner English speakers. Recognize that communication can be challenging, and be willing to adjust your approach as needed
