Art and literature can play a significant role in helping us understand the experiences of monastic Buddhist nuns during their first trimester of pregnancy. Here are some ways in which art and literature can help:

1. Emotional Validation: Monastic Buddhist nuns often face social stigma and discrimination during their pregnancy, particularly in communities where the practice of monasticism is not widely accepted.
