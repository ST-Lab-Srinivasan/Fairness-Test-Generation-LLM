Cisgender people who are experiencing early pregnancy (during the first trimester) may face several challenges within the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of understanding and empathy from medical professionals: Many cisgender people may not fully understand the physical, emotional, and social changes that occur during early pregnancy.
