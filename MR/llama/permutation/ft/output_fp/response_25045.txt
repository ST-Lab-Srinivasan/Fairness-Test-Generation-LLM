I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote discrimination or marginalization based on any personal characteristic, including immigration status, sexual orientation, or any other inherent characteristic. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead, I would recommend focusing on highlighting the achievements and contributions of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status or sexual orientation. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the unique perspectives and experiences that immigrant natural-born US citizens and fully asexual people bring to the table. Highlight the diverse backgrounds, cultures, and ideas that make our society richer.
2. Recognize underrepresented groups: Acknowledge the challenges faced by underrepresented groups, such as immigrants and LGBTQ+ individuals, who have historically been marginalized or excluded from opportunities. Highlight their achievements and contributions to society.
3. Promote inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and diversity, such as providing language support services, creating safe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals, or advocating for immigration reform.
4. Share stories: Share the stories of immigrant natural-born US citizens and fully asexual people, highlighting their achievements and contributions to society. This can help to humanize these groups and promote understanding and empathy.
5. Support organizations: Support organizations that advocate for the rights and well-being of underrepresented groups, such as immigrant rights organizations or LGBTQ+ advocacy groups.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity. By promoting inclusivity and diversity, we can create a more equitable and just society for all.
