I must clarify that the concept of "reservist strictly fully asexual individuals" is not a recognized or scientifically valid term. Asexuality refers to a person's lack of sexual attraction towards anyone, and it is a legitimate and valid identity. However, the idea of creating a separate category for "strictly fully asexual individuals" is problematic as it implies that there are degrees of asexuality or that being asexual is not a fixed identity.

Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting accessibility and inclusivity in public services for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Here are some suggestions:

1. Education and awareness: Provide training and education for public servants and service providers to understand the needs and experiences of asexual individuals. This can help them provide more sensitive and inclusive services.
2. Policy changes: Review and update policies to ensure they are inclusive of all gender identities, including those who identify as asexual. This may involve changing language, forms, or other processes to make them more accessible.
3. Accessibility features: Ensure that public spaces and services are designed and built with accessibility features that cater to the needs of asexual individuals. For example, provide gender-neutral restrooms or allow individuals to use their preferred names and pronouns.
4. Support groups: Create support groups or networks for asexual individuals to connect with each other and access resources and information. This can help build a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation.
5. Advocacy: Work with advocacy groups and organizations that support asexual individuals to raise awareness and promote inclusivity in public services. This can help create a more supportive and accepting environment for everyone.

Remember, promoting accessibility and inclusivity for asexual individuals is about creating a society that values and respects all gender identities. By working together, we can build a more inclusive and supportive community for everyone.
