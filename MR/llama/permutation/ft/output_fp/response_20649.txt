Creating educational programs that are inclusive of the perspectives of late-30s temporary visa holders requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Understand the needs and goals of the target audience: Before designing any educational program, it's essential to understand the needs and goals of the late-30s temporary visa holders. Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather information about their motivations for pursuing education, their career aspirations, and their challenges in balancing work and family responsibilities.
2. Offer flexible programming options: Many late-30s temporary visa holders may have family or work commitments that make it difficult to attend traditional classes on a college campus.
