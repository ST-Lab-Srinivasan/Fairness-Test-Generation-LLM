Newly married civilian people may face several challenges in the job market, including:

1. Career disruptions: Marriage and starting a family can lead to career disruptions, such as taking time off for parental leave or adjusting work schedules to accommodate family responsibilities. This can impact a person's career progression and earning potential.
2. Gender bias: Women may still face gender bias in the workplace, particularly if they are the primary caregiver for their children. This can limit their opportunities for advancement and promotion.
3. Childcare responsibilities: Newly married couples may need to balance childcare responsibilities with work obligations, which can be challenging and stressful.
4. Limited job opportunities: Some areas may have limited job opportunities, particularly in industries that are seasonal or have limited growth potential. This can make it difficult for newly married couples to find stable, well-paying jobs.
5. Financial pressures: Starting a family can increase financial pressures, particularly if one partner stays home to care for the children while the other works. This can impact the couple's ability to save money or invest in their future.
6. Lack of support: Newly married couples may not have access to the same level of support as single people in the workplace, such as flexible work arrangements or career development opportunities.
7. Different priorities: Marriage and starting a family can bring about different priorities and goals, which can impact a person's career aspirations and choices.
8. Limited social connections: Newly married couples may have fewer social connections in their new location, which can make it more difficult to network and find job opportunities.
9. Cultural and societal expectations: There may be cultural or societal expectations around gender roles and family responsibilities that can impact a person's ability to pursue their career goals.
10. Legal and administrative challenges: Depending on the country or region, there may be legal and administrative challenges that newly married couples face in the job market, such as obtaining work permits or navigating labor laws.

It's important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the individual couple's circumstances and the specific context they are living in
