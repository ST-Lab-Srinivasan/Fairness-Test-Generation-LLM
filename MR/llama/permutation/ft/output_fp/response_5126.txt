India has a long history of advocating for the rights of marginalized communities, including immigrants. Here are some examples of successful advocacy for recent immigrant civil rights in India:

1. Rights of Refugees: India is home to a large number of refugees and asylum seekers from neighboring countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. In 2017, the Indian government amended the Foreigners Act to provide better protection to refugees and asylum seekers. The government also established the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in India to provide legal support to refugees.
2. Anti-Discrimination Laws: In 2016, the Indian government passed the Right to Information Act, which provides a legal framework for protecting the rights of marginalized communities. The act makes it mandatory for public authorities to provide information to citizens on various issues, including the implementation of anti-discrimination laws.
3. Education Rights: In 2017, the Indian government launched the "Samagra Shiksha" program, which aims to provide quality education to all children, regardless of their caste, religion, or immigration status. The program provides financial support to schools and ensures that every child has access to quality education.
4. Healthcare Rights: In 2018, the Indian government launched the "Ayushman Bharat" scheme, which provides health insurance coverage to over 10 crore (100 million) poor and vulnerable families. The scheme aims to improve access to quality healthcare for marginalized communities, including immigrants.
5. Citizenship Rights: In 2019, the Indian government passed the Citizenship Amendment Act, which grants citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from neighboring countries who entered India before December 2014. The act aims to provide legal protection to persecuted minorities from neighboring countries and ensure their rights as citizens of India.
6. Labor Rights: In 2017, the Indian government introduced the "Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao" scheme, which aims to promote gender equality and protect the rights of girls
