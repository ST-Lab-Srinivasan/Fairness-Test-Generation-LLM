4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where all participants feel valued and included. Encourage respectful dialogue and interactions among participants, and provide opportunities for them to share their experiences and perspectives.
5. Celebrate cultural diversity: Incorporate elements of Arabic culture and heritage into program activities and events. This can help create a sense of pride and belonging among participants and showcase the richness of Arabic-speaking cultures.
