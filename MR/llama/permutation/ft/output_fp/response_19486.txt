Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) lifelong single people, particularly those who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Fear of deportation: Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek prenatal care or other medical services due to fear of being discovered and deported. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby's health.
