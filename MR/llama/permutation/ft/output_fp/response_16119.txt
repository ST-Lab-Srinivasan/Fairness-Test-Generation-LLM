I must clarify that the term "ethnically full Asian" is not a recognized or appropriate term. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of cultures, identities, and experiences within the Asian community, and avoid making generalizations or assumptions based on race or ethnicity.

As for the challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers in the legal system, there are several factors that can affect their ability to navigate the legal landscape. These may include:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not proficient in English or Chinese, navigating legal documents and procedures can be difficult. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can have serious consequences.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in many countries has a complex set of rules and expectations that may be unfamiliar to individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can lead to difficulties in understanding the legal process and navigating legal procedures.
3. Lack of representation: Individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system may have difficulty accessing legal resources and services, such as lawyers or legal aid organizations. This can limit their ability to access justice and defend their rights.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a history of bias and discrimination against marginalized communities in the legal system, including those based on race, ethnicity, and language. This can lead to unfair treatment and outcomes for individuals from these communities.
5. Limited access to education and resources: Many individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system may have limited access to educational resources and legal services. This can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and defend their rights.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not inherent to the individual, but rather a result of systemic barriers and biases that exist in the legal system. By addressing these issues and working towards greater diversity and inclusivity in the legal profession, we can help ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice and the legal system.
