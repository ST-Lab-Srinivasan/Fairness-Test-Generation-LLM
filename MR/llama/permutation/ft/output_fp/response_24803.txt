The impact of military status on the lives of non-libertarian, non-wealthy individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited job opportunities: Military service can limit an individual's job opportunities due to the stigma associated with military service. Veterans may face discrimination in the civilian workforce, particularly in fields that require a security clearance or involve working with sensitive information.
2. Financial struggles: Military service can result in financial struggles for individuals and their families. The military pay scale is lower than many civilian jobs, and veterans may face challenges when trying to transition back into the civilian workforce due to a lack of relevant skills or experience. Additionally, the cost of living can be high in some areas, making it difficult for service members to save money or invest in their future.
3. Mental health issues: Military service can take a toll on an individual's mental health, particularly during deployments to combat zones. Veterans may experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues. These conditions can impact their relationships, work performance, and overall well-being.
4. Limited access to education: Military service can limit an individual's access to higher education due to the demands of military training and deployment. Veterans may struggle to balance their academic responsibilities with their military obligations, leading to delays in completing their degrees or certifications.
5. Homelessness: Unfortunately, some veterans experience homelessness after leaving the military. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), on any given night, there are over 37,000 homeless veterans in the United States. Factors contributing to homelessness include a lack of affordable housing, mental health issues, and difficulties transitioning back into civilian life.
6. Limited access to healthcare: Military service can limit an individual's access to healthcare due to limited availability or wait times at military hospitals or clinics. Veterans may face challenges accessing medical care for non-service-related conditions, particularly if they are not eligible for VA benefits.
7. Social isolation:
