Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Spanish speaker mixed African-American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that takes into account their unique experiences, perspectives, and needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency and diversity for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the complexities of mixed race identity and how to create an inclusive environment.
2. Inclusive Programming: Offer programs that cater to the diverse cultural backgrounds of participants, such as bilingual storytime sessions, cultural craft activities, or multicultural dance classes.
3. Representation Matters: Ensure that the program's staff and resources reflect the diversity of the community it serves. This includes hiring bilingual staff, using diverse materials in programming, and incorporating music, art, and literature from different cultures.
4. Community Engagement: Build relationships with local organizations that serve mixed-race communities and engage in mutually beneficial partnerships. This can help to create a more inclusive environment for participants.
5. Flexibility and Accommodation: Be flexible and accommodating when it comes to meeting the needs of participants. For example, offering flexible scheduling or making materials available in multiple languages can help ensure that everyone has access to the program.
6. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group.
7. Intersectionality: Be mindful of the intersections of race, ethnicity, and culture. Recognize that individuals may identify with multiple groups and experiences, and programmatically address these intersections.
8. Community Outreach: Reach out to mixed-race communities and organizations to promote the program and gather feedback. This can help ensure that the program is meeting the needs of this diverse group.
9. Evaluation and Assessment: Regularly evaluate and assess the program's inclusivity and cultural sensitivity. Use this information to make improvements and adjustments as needed.
10. Continuous Learning: Commit to continuous learning and improvement. Stay up-to-date on best practices in serving diverse communities, and be willing to adapt and evolve over time.
