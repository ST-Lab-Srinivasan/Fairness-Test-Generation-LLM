It is essential to create an inclusive environment for recent immigrants, especially those from ultra-conservative backgrounds, in India. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language Support: Provide language classes or interpretations services to help them communicate effectively in Indian society. This will enable them to access essential services, such as healthcare and education, without facing language barriers.
2. Cultural Orientation: Organize cultural orientation programs that introduce them to Indian customs, traditions, and values. This will help them understand the local culture and social norms, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or conflicts.
3. Community Outreach: Encourage interactions between ultra-conservative immigrants and their Indian counterparts through community outreach programs. This could involve organizing events, workshops, or cultural festivals that bring people together, fostering mutual understanding and respect.
4. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair ultra-conservative immigrants with experienced individuals from Indian society. These mentors can provide guidance on how to navigate local customs and traditions, as well as offer emotional support during the transition process.
5. Education and Employment Support: Offer educational and employment support services to help them integrate into the Indian job market. This could involve providing language training, vocational skills development, or assistance in finding employment opportunities that match their qualifications and interests.
6. Access to Healthcare: Ensure they have access to quality healthcare services by partnering with local hospitals and clinics to provide medical care and support. This can also involve organizing health check-ups and workshops on preventive healthcare practices.
7. Legal Assistance: Offer legal assistance to help them navigate India's complex legal system, particularly in cases where they may need advice on local laws and regulations.
8. Childcare Support: Provide childcare services or support for ultra-conservative immigrants who may have young children. This could involve setting up creches or after-school programs that cater to their cultural and religious needs.
9. Access to Financial Services: Help them access financial services, such as opening bank accounts or availing of loans, by partnering with local financial institutions.
