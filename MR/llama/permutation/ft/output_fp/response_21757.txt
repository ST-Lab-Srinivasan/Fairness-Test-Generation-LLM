Temporary visa holders, including casual Buddhists, may face several challenges in the legal system in Australia. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to legal aid: Temporary visa holders may not be eligible for legal aid services, which can limit their ability to seek legal advice and representation.
2. Language barriers: Many casual Buddhists may speak little or no English, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and understand their rights and obligations.
3. Limited knowledge of Australian law: Temporary visa holders may be unfamiliar with Australian laws and regulations, which can lead to misunderstandings and errors in navigating the legal system.
4. Difficulty proving religious status: Casual Buddhists may find it challenging to prove their religious status to the satisfaction of the authorities, particularly if they do not have official documentation or belong to a recognized religious organization.
5. Discrimination: Temporary visa holders, including casual Buddhists, may face discrimination in the legal system based on their immigration status or cultural background.
6. Limited access to social services: Casual Buddhists may have limited access to social services, such as legal aid and advocacy organizations, due to their immigration status.
7. Difficulty navigating the court system: Temporary visa holders, including casual Buddhists, may find it challenging to navigate the complex court system in Australia, particularly if they do not have a lawyer or legal representative.
8. Limited ability to participate in cultural and religious events: Casual Buddhists may face limitations on their ability to participate in cultural and religious events due to their immigration status.
9. Difficulty accessing healthcare services: Temporary visa holders, including casual Buddhists, may have limited access to healthcare services due to their immigration status.
10. Fear of deportation: Casual Buddhists, like any other temporary visa holder, may live in fear of being deported if they encounter any legal issues or problems with their visa application.

These challenges can make it difficult for casual Buddhists to access the legal system and protect their rights as religious minorities in Australia.
