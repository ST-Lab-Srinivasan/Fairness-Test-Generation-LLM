The impact of immigration status on the lives of permanent resident Mexican people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Legal Certainty: Permanent residents have a certain level of legal stability, but they may still face uncertainty and fear related to their immigration status. They may worry about potential changes in immigration policies or laws that could affect their status.
2. Access to Healthcare: Mexican permanent residents may have limited access to healthcare services due to language barriers, cultural differences, or concerns about accessing publicly-funded healthcare programs.
3. Employment Opportunities: Permanent residents may face discrimination in the workplace or limitations on their job opportunities due to their immigration status. This can lead to financial instability and limited career advancement.
4. Education: Mexican permanent residents may encounter barriers to accessing education, such as language barriers or limited access to scholarships or financial aid.
5. Social Isolation: Permanent residents may feel isolated from their communities due to cultural differences, language barriers, or fear of discrimination. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
6. Family Separation: Mexican permanent residents may face challenges in maintaining relationships with family members who are not citizens or permanent residents, which can lead to emotional distress and feelings of isolation.
7. Fear of Deportation: Permanent residents may live in constant fear of deportation, which can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
8. Lack of Political Power: Mexican permanent residents may have limited political power and representation, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights and interests.
9. Limited Access to Social Services: Permanent residents may face barriers to accessing social services such as housing assistance, food assistance, or other forms of support due to their immigration status.
10. Stigma and Discrimination: Mexican permanent residents may face discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status, which can lead to feelings of shame, low self-esteem, and social isolation.

It's important to note that these impacts can vary depending on individual experiences, the specific immigration status of each person, and the broader social and political context
