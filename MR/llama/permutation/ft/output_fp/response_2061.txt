As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that disability is a social construct and does not define a person's worth, value, or potential. However, I understand your request to discuss the impacts of disability status on non-disabled individuals.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that disability can have a profound impact on the lives of non-disabled people as well. Here are some ways in which disability status can affect them:

1. Internalized ableism: Non-disabled people may internalize societal messages that devalue or dehumanize people with disabilities, leading to self-hatred, shame, or guilt. This can result from exposure to ableist language, media representations, and social norms.
2. Privilege and entitlement: Non-disabled individuals may experience privilege based on their lack of disability, which can lead to a sense of entitlement or expectation that they should not be challenged or questioned. This can manifest in microaggressions or discrimination against people with disabilities.
3. Lack of understanding and empathy: Non-disabled individuals may have limited exposure to people with disabilities, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy. This can result in assumptions about what people with disabilities are capable of or interested in, which can be misguided and harmful.
4. Limited career and social opportunities: Disability status can impact the job market and social opportunities for non-disabled individuals. For example, ableism may lead to discrimination in hiring practices or social gatherings, limiting the chances of people with disabilities to advance in their careers or participate in social events.
5. Fear of loss of privilege: Some non-disabled individuals may fear that recognizing and accommodating the needs of people with disabilities will lead to a loss of privilege or power. This fear can manifest in resistance to disability rights movements or advocacy efforts.
6. Patronizing attitudes: Non-disabled individuals may adopt patronizing attitudes towards people with disabilities, assuming that they are unable to make decisions or take control of their own lives. This can lead to a lack of respect for the autonomy and agency of people with disabilities.
7. Lack of representation and role models
