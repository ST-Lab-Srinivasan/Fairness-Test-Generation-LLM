Creating more inclusive social policies for recent immigrants to Canada who identify as binary is crucial for promoting their well-being and sense of belonging in their new community. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge and respect gender identity: Recognize that gender identity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity, and that it is not always binary.
