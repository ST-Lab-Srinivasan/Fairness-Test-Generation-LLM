Promoting the educational success of native French speakers in schools can be challenging, especially during the 1st trimester when they may be dealing with the physical and emotional changes associated with pregnancy. However, there are several strategies that educators and administrators can use to support these students and help them succeed academically:

1. Provide accommodations: Offer native French speakers accommodations such as extra time to complete assignments or tests, quiet study areas, or the option to take exams in a different format (e.g., oral instead of written). This can help reduce the stress and fatigue associated with pregnancy and improve their ability to focus on their studies.
2. Offer mental health support: Pregnancy can be an emotionally challenging time, especially for native French speakers who may face additional cultural and societal pressures. Provide access to mental health resources such as counseling or therapy to help students manage stress and anxiety.
3. Encourage self-care: Encourage native French speakers to prioritize self-care during the 1st trimester. This can include activities such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones. By taking care of their physical and emotional well-being, students will be better equipped to handle the demands of school.
4. Provide nutrition education: Pregnancy is a time when proper nutrition is crucial for both mother and baby. Offer native French speakers nutrition education and resources to help them make informed decisions about their diet during this time.
5. Create a supportive environment: Foster a supportive and inclusive learning environment that acknowledges the challenges faced by native French speakers during pregnancy. Encourage classmates to be understanding and respectful of students' needs, and provide opportunities for students to connect with one another and build a sense of community.
6. Offer gender-neutral and inclusive materials: Provide educational materials that are gender-neutral and inclusive of all pregnant students, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can help reduce stigma and promote a more supportive and welcoming learning environment.
7. Engage with the broader community: Connect native French speakers with local organizations and
