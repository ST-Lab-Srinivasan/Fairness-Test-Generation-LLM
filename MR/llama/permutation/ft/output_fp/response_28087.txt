Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner French speakers who are not newly married individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help you create such programs:

1. Identify the needs of your target audience: Understand the needs, preferences, and challenges faced by beginner French speakers in your community. Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather insights and ensure that your programs cater to their specific requirements.
2. Offer flexible scheduling options: Accommodate learners with different schedules by offering classes at various times of the day, including evenings or weekends. This will make it easier for people who work full-time or have family commitments to attend.
3. Provide childcare services: Offering on-site childcare or partnerships with local daycare centers can help remove a significant barrier for parents who want to learn French but cannot find reliable care for their children during class hours.
4. Host events and activities: Organize social events, cultural celebrations, and language exchange opportunities that cater to the interests of beginner French speakers. This will create an enjoyable and inclusive atmosphere where learners can practice their skills in a relaxed setting.
5. Use diverse teaching methods: Incorporate various teaching methods, such as conversation classes, grammar workshops, and cultural immersion experiences, to cater to different learning styles and preferences. This will help keep learners engaged and motivated throughout the program.
6. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair beginner French speakers with more advanced learners or native speakers who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement throughout their language journey.
7. Provide resources and materials: Make sure that learners have access to high-quality language learning resources, such as textbooks, audio materials, and online courses. Offering these resources in digital formats can make it easier for learners who may not have easy access to physical materials.
8. Foster a supportive community: Encourage learners to connect with one another through social media groups or in-person events. This will help build a sense of belonging and motivate learners to continue practicing their French skills outside of class.
9. Offer individualized attention: Provide opportunities for one-on-one tutoring or small group
