1. Acknowledge and validate their identities: Start by recognizing and validating the diverse identities of your participants, including their French and Asian heritages. Avoid making assumptions about their identities or expecting them to choose only one culture.
2. Incorporate multiple perspectives: Make sure that the cultural programs include multiple perspectives and representations of Asian cultures. This can be achieved by incorporating stories, music, dance, and art from various Asian countries and communities.
3. Foster a safe space: Create a safe and inclusive environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives. Encourage open communication and active listening to ensure that everyone's voice is heard.

5. Offer culturally relevant resources: Provide access to culturally relevant books, films, music, and other resources that reflect the diversity of Asian cultures. Encourage participants to share their favorite cultural resources with each other.
6. Engage with local communities: Collaborate with local Asian communities to develop cultural programs that are meaningful and relevant to them. This can help build bridges between different cultures and create a sense of shared ownership and pride.

8. Celebrate intersectionality: Acknowledge the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other identities within Asian cultures. Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives on how these intersections shape their cultural identities.
9. Address cultural appropriation: Educate participants about cultural appropriation and its impact on marginalized communities. Encourage respectful borrowing of cultural practices and traditions, and create opportunities for meaningful dialogue and reflection.
