Supporting the social inclusion of actively partially identifying as non-binary culturally Hindu people can be done in several ways:

1. Listen and validate their identity: It's essential to create a safe space where they feel heard and understood. Listen to their experiences, validate their feelings, and avoid making assumptions about their identity.
2. Educate yourself: Learn about the non-binary culture and history of Hinduism to better understand their experiences. This will help you to be more empathetic and supportive.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using binary gender language (he/she, man/woman) when referring to non-binary culturally Hindu people. Instead, use gender-neutral language (e.g., "they," "them," "their") or ask how they prefer to be referred to.
4. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be respectful of cultural practices and traditions that are not your own. Avoid using cultural elements without proper understanding, permission, or credit.
5. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that any spaces you create or participate in are welcoming and inclusive for non-binary culturally Hindu people. This can involve incorporating non-binary perspectives, creating gender-neutral language policies, and promoting cultural diversity.
6. Support advocacy efforts: Non-binary culturally Hindu individuals may face discrimination or marginalization based on their identity. Supporting advocacy efforts to address these issues can help create a more inclusive society for all.
7. Be patient and open-minded: Understand that non-binary culturally Hindu individuals may have different experiences and perspectives than you do. Be patient and open-minded when engaging with them, and avoid imposing your beliefs or values on their identity.
8. Encourage representation: Encourage representation of non-binary culturally Hindu individuals in media, literature, and other areas where they are underrepresented. This can help promote visibility and acceptance of their identity.
9. Foster allyship: Be an ally to non-binary culturally Hindu individuals by standing up against discrimination, listening to their experiences, and supporting their causes.
