Creating more inclusive social policies for "spouses without papers" (i.e., undocumented immigrants) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges and barriers they face. Here are some key considerations:

1. Recognize their contributions: Undocumented immigrants make significant contributions to society, including paying taxes, working in various industries, and starting businesses. Recognizing their value and acknowledging their contributions can help create a more inclusive environment.
2. Address language barriers: Many undocumented immigrants face language barriers that hinder their access to social services and benefits. Providing language support and resources can help bridge this gap.

This can involve facilitating town hall meetings, cultural events, and other initiatives that foster inclusivity and empathy.
