I'm glad you're interested in celebrating the cultural contributions of people who have recently experienced a loss. However, it's important to recognize that widowhood and pregnancy can be sensitive topics, especially during the 1st trimester. Here are some ways to approach this:

5. Be patient: Recognize that healing is a process, and it may take time for the individual to work through their grief. Be patient and understanding, and let them know that you're there for them whenever they're ready to talk or need support.
6. Avoid clichés: Avoid using clichéd phrases or statements that might come across as insensitive or dismissive. Instead, focus on offering genuine support and validation.

8. Offer practical help: In addition to emotional support, offer practical help where you can. This might involve helping with household chores,
