Promoting the social inclusion of secular Jewish physically disabled communities is essential for creating a more equitable and inclusive society. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Education and Awareness: Organize workshops, seminars, and conferences to educate the broader community about the experiences and challenges faced by secular Jewish physically disabled individuals.
