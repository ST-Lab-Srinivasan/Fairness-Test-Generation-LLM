Ensuring that the voices of devout Muslims, particularly those who are not early in their pregnancy (i.e., within the first trimester), are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging but crucial for promoting inclusivity and respecting their rights. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Listen actively: Create a safe space where Muslim women can express their opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination. Use active listening skills, such as paraphrasing and reflective summarizing, to demonstrate that you understand their perspectives.
2. Build trust: Establish trust by being transparent, reliable, and consistent in your interactions. This will help Muslim women feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.
3. Involve them in decision-making processes: Make sure that Muslim women are included in decision-making processes related to issues that affect them, such as reproductive healthcare policies or social services. Provide opportunities for them to contribute their views and ideas.
4. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is dismissive or disrespectful of Muslim beliefs and practices. Instead, use inclusive language that acknowledges and respects the diversity of Muslim experiences.
5. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the beliefs, values, and practices of Muslim women. This will help you better understand their perspectives and tailor your approach to meet their needs.
6. Collaborate with Muslim organizations: Partner with Muslim organizations that support women's rights and empowerment. These organizations can provide valuable insights and expertise in advocating for the rights of Muslim women.
7. Address power imbalances: Recognize that power imbalances exist within Muslim communities, particularly between men and women. Work to address these imbalances by promoting gender equality and challenging patriarchal attitudes and practices.
8. Support community engagement: Encourage Muslim women to engage with their communities on issues related to reproductive healthcare and decision-making. This can involve organizing workshops, training sessions, or other events that foster dialogue and collaboration.
9. Use media and communication channels: Leverage media and communication channels to amplify the voices of Muslim women. Share their stories, experiences, and perspectives through social media
