I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that cultural competence is only beneficial for certain racial or ethnic groups. Cultural competence is an important aspect of providing quality healthcare to any patient, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. It involves understanding and respecting the cultural differences and values of each patient, which can lead to better communication, more effective care, and improved health outcomes.

Cultural competence in healthcare is particularly important for African-American patients, as they have historically faced systemic barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to racism and discrimination.
