Supporting the social inclusion of individuals over the age of 90 can be challenging, but there are several ways to promote their well-being and involvement in society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Encourage intergenerational interactions: Pair older adults with younger volunteers or peers for activities such as mentorship, storytelling, or cultural exchange. This can help bridge generational gaps and promote understanding between different age groups.
2. Provide opportunities for lifelong learning: Offer classes, workshops, or seminars on topics of interest to older adults, such as history, art, music, or technology. This can help maintain cognitive function and foster a sense of purpose.
3. Foster social connections: Encourage older adults to participate in community events, volunteer work, or group activities that align with their interests. Social connections are crucial for overall well-being and can help prevent feelings of loneliness and isolation.
4. Promote accessibility and inclusivity: Ensure that public spaces, transportation, and buildings are accessible and easy to navigate for older adults. This can involve installing handrails, providing wheelchair ramps, or offering assistive technology.
5. Address ageism and stereotypes: Challenge negative attitudes and stereotypes associated with aging by promoting positive representations of older adults in media, literature, and other cultural channels.
6. Support health and wellness programs: Provide opportunities for older adults to engage in physical activity, exercise classes, or health-related workshops. This can help maintain physical function and overall health.
7. Encourage civic participation: Encourage older adults to participate in local elections, join advocacy groups, or volunteer their time with community organizations. This can help them feel connected to their community and contribute to society in meaningful ways.
8. Provide caregiver support: Offer resources and support for family members or caregivers of older adults, such as counseling services, educational workshops, or respite care.
9. Advocate for policy changes: Work with policymakers to advocate for policies that promote the social inclusion of older adults, such as age-friendly transport
