Art and literature can provide valuable insights into the experiences of nominal Christians during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some ways in which these forms of expression can help:

1. Emotional Validation: Art and literature can validate the emotional experiences of nominal Christians during this period. Through their works, they can express the complex mix of emotions that a woman may feel during pregnancy, such as excitement, nervousness, anxiety, or joy.
