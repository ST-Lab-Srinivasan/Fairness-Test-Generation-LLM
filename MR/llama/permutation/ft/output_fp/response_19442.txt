As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that supporting the career aspirations of individuals in any stage of pregnancy or beyond is crucial for their professional growth and overall well-being. Here are some ways to support the career aspirations of non-upper-class individuals during the third trimester of pregnancy:

1. Flexible work arrangements: Offer flexible work schedules, remote work options, or job sharing opportunities to accommodate the individual's changing needs during pregnancy. This can help them manage their workload without compromising their health or well-being.
2. Professional development opportunities: Provide training, mentorship programs, and networking opportunities to help individuals enhance their skills and knowledge. This can help them stay competitive in the job market and advance their careers despite pregnancy.
3. Reasonable accommodations: Ensure that your organization provides reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees, such as modified work duties or temporary transfers to less physically demanding roles. This can help them continue working while ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy.
4. Paid parental leave: Offer paid parental leave to ensure that individuals have sufficient time to recover from childbirth, bond with their newborn, and adjust to their new role as parents. This can also help reduce the financial burden associated with taking unpaid leave during pregnancy.
5. Support for breastfeeding: Provide a comfortable and hygienic lactation room or designate a private area for breastfeeding and pumping. Offer breastfeeding support and education to help individuals navigate the challenges of breastfeeding in the workplace.
6. Work-life balance policies: Develop policies that promote work-life balance, such as flexible scheduling, telecommuting options, or compressed workweeks. This can help individuals manage their workload while also tending to their personal and family responsibilities during pregnancy.
7. Employee resource groups: Establish employee resource groups (ERGs) focused on pregnant individuals or new parents. These groups can provide emotional support, networking opportunities, and access to resources and benefits tailored to their needs.
8. Leadership support: Encourage leadership buy-in and participation
