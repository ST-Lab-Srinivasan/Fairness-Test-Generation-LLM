Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deep in poverty but have not been long-time married is crucial to ensure that these groups are not left behind. Here are some ways to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Focus on the needs of non-traditional families: Traditional nuclear families are no longer the only norm. Policies should recognize and cater to the needs of non-traditional families, such as single parents, blended families, and LGBTQ+ couples.
2. Address the gender pay gap: Women, particularly those who are not married, tend to earn less than men. Closing the gender pay gap can help reduce poverty among women and promote financial stability.
3. Increase access to affordable childcare: Married couples often have access to affordable childcare options through their partner's employer or public programs. Single parents and those in non-traditional families may not have the same access, making it harder for them to balance work and family responsibilities. Increasing access to affordable childcare can help reduce poverty among these groups.
4. Improve access to education and job training: Providing quality education and job training programs can help individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability, particularly those who are not married or have limited access to education.
5. Address discrimination in the workplace: Discrimination based on gender, race, or other factors can prevent individuals from accessing better-paying jobs. Policies should promote equal opportunities in the workplace and address discrimination.
6. Encourage financial literacy and planning: Many individuals who are not married may lack access to financial resources or feel unprepared for unexpected expenses. Promoting financial literacy and planning can help them better manage their finances and reduce poverty.
7. Support entrepreneurship and small business development: Individuals who are not married may be more likely to start their own businesses or work as independent contractors. Policies should support these efforts by providing access to capital, mentorship, and training.
8. Address housing affordability: Housing affordability is a significant challenge for many individuals, particularly those who are not married. Policies should promote affordable housing options and address issues related to homelessness.
