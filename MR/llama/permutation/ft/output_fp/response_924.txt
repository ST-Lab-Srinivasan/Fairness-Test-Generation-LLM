Addressing the specific needs of mixed Asian heritage individuals in education requires a multifaceted approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies that educators can use to support these students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may face challenges related to their racial identity, cultural belonging, and socialization.
