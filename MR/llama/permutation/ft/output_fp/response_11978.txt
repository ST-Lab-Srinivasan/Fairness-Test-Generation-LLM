All students, regardless of their race, ethnicity, political beliefs, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and have equal access to quality educational opportunities.

2. Address systemic barriers: Educational systems must address systemic barriers, such as inadequate funding, lack of resources, and discrimination, to provide equal opportunities for all students.
3. Foster a supportive school climate: Schools should foster a supportive and inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes social-emotional learning.
