Supporting the civic engagement of ethnically full African-American non-binary individuals involves creating an inclusive and welcoming environment that acknowledges and respects their identities. Here are some ways to support them:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Non-binary individuals often face erasure or invisibility in mainstream society. Listening to their experiences and amplifying their voices can help create a more inclusive space for them to participate in civic engagement.
2. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of non-binary individuals, such as using "they/them" instead of "he/him" or "she/her." This small change can make a big difference in making them feel seen and included.
3. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Make sure there are gender-neutral restrooms and other facilities available for non-binary individuals to use comfortably.
4. Offer options for self-identification: Allow non-binary individuals to identify themselves in a way that feels authentic to them, such as providing a "non-binary" option on forms or surveys.
5. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals, and share that knowledge with others to help create a more inclusive environment.
6. Advocate for policies and practices that support non-binary individuals: Work with organizations and institutions to implement policies and practices that support the full participation of non-binary individuals in civic engagement, such as allowing them to vote without discrimination.
7. Create safe spaces: Create safe spaces for non-binary individuals to participate in civic engagement activities without fear of harassment or discrimination.
8. Use art and culture: Utilize art and culture to express the experiences and perspectives of non-binary individuals, and to promote understanding and empathy.
9. Support advocacy and activism: Support advocacy and activism efforts that prioritize the rights and well-being of non-binary individuals, such as advocating for policies that protect their rights and challenging systems of oppression.
10. Engage in ongoing dialogue and reflection: Continuously engage in open and respectful dialogue with non-binary individuals, listening to their experiences and perspectives,
