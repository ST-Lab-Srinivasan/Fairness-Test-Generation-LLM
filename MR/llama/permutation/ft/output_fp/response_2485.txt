Addressing the needs of non-liberal individuals in disaster response requires a culturally sensitive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Involve local leaders and community members: Non-liberal individuals may be more likely to trust and respond to disaster responses led by local leaders and community members who share their values and beliefs. Involving these individuals in the response effort can help build trust and ensure that their needs are addressed.
2. Be sensitive to cultural norms: Disaster responses should be mindful of the cultural norms and practices of non-liberal communities. For example, some cultures may have specific beliefs about how to handle dead bodies or how to provide emotional support to affected individuals. It's important to respect these cultural norms and practices when providing disaster response services.
3. Provide gender-sensitive services: Non-liberal communities may have different gender roles and expectations than liberal societies. Disaster responses should be designed to address the unique needs of both men and women, including provision of separate spaces for women and children, if necessary.
4. Address social and cultural exclusion: Non-liberal individuals may face social and cultural exclusion due to their beliefs or practices. Disaster responses should seek to address these issues by promoting inclusivity and respect for diversity.
5. Foster community cohesion: Non-liberal communities may be more resilient when they work together during a disaster response. Disaster responses should prioritize building community cohesion by fostering collaboration and cooperation among community members.
6. Provide tailored support: Non-liberal individuals may have unique needs that are not addressed by standardized disaster response services. Disaster responses should be flexible enough to provide tailored support based on the specific needs of each community.
7. Address power imbalances: Non-liberal communities may have power imbalances due to gender, age, or other factors. Disaster responses should seek to address these power imbalances by promoting participatory decision-making and involving marginalized groups in the response effort.
8. Be aware of language barriers: Non-liberal individuals may not speak the dominant language of the disaster affected area. Disaster responses should provide translation services or use simple
