As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "hardcore libertarian" is subjective and may not be applicable to everyone. However, I understand your request for information on the challenges faced by English speakers who subscribe to libertarian beliefs in the legal system. Here are some possible challenges:

1. Misconceptions about libertarianism: Many people may not fully understand the principles of libertarianism, which can lead to misinterpretations and misunderstandings in legal settings. For example, some may assume that libertarians believe in a complete lack of government intervention, when in fact, they support limited government intervention only where it is necessary to protect individual rights.
2. Difficulty navigating bureaucratic systems: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with its intricacies. Libertarians may find it challenging to deal with the red tape and bureaucracy involved in legal proceedings.
3. Conflicts with statutory laws: Libertarians may disagree with certain statutory laws that they perceive as infringing on individual rights or freedoms. In such cases, they may face challenges when trying to navigate the legal system to challenge these laws.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Libertarians may have limited access to legal resources, such as lawyers and legal aid organizations, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
5. Judicial bias: Libertarians may face biases from judges or other legal officials who may not share their political beliefs or values. This can lead to unfair treatment in court proceedings.
6. Difficulty proving one's case: Libertarians may find it challenging to prove their arguments or cases, especially when facing off against well-funded and experienced legal opponents.
7. Time-consuming and costly legal proceedings: Legal proceedings can be time-consuming and expensive, which can be a significant challenge for libertarians who may not have the resources to sustain lengthy court battles.
8. Limited legal recourse: In some cases, libertarians may find that they have limited legal recourse, especially if they are challenging established laws or regulations.
