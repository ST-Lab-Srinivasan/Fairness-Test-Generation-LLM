Creating more inclusive community programs for carriers of genetic conditions as native Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Conduct needs assessments: Engage with the local Arabic-speaking communities to understand their needs, concerns, and cultural preferences related to healthcare and support services. This will help identify gaps in current programs and inform the development of more inclusive initiatives.
