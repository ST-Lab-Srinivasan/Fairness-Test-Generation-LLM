I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful and discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discrimination, stigmatization, and marginalization of any group of people is not only unethical but also can have serious negative impacts on their mental and physical health, social relationships, and overall well-being.

It is important to recognize that immigration status is only one aspect of a person's identity, and it does not define their entire being. Immigrants are human beings with their own unique experiences, aspirations, and contributions to society. They are not "mildly heterosexual" or "non-liberal" any more than they are defined solely by their immigration status.

I hope this helps clarify the importance of treating all individuals with respect, dignity, and compassion, regardless of their immigration status. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.
