Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of non-upper middle-income, non-conservative individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Non-citizens, including those with a valid visa or green card, may face barriers when trying to access healthcare services in the US. They may be required to pay out-of-pocket for medical care, which can be expensive and unaffordable for some individuals.
2. Financial instability: Non-citizens may experience financial instability due to factors such as limited access to employment opportunities, inconsistent income, and lack of access to social safety nets. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and difficulty providing for oneself or one's family.
