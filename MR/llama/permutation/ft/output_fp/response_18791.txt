Ensuring the financial needs of natural-born recently naturalized citizens with unknown genetic conditions can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to help address these needs:

1. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that these individuals have access to affordable and quality healthcare services, including specialized care for any known or suspected genetic conditions.
