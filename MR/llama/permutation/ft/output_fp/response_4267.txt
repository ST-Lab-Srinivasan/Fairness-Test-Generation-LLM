Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are cisgender, requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some key considerations:

1. Acknowledge the importance of cultural competence: Beginner Arabic speakers come from diverse backgrounds and experiences. It's essential to recognize that language learning is not just about mastering grammar rules or vocabulary, but also about understanding the cultural nuances and values associated with the Arabic-speaking world. Cultivate cultural competence by incorporating information on Arab customs, traditions, and values into your social policies.
2. Foster an inclusive learning environment: Ensure that your language learning space is welcoming and inclusive for all beginner Arabic speakers, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Use inclusive language in your teaching materials and avoid any content that could be offensive or alienating to marginalized groups.
3. Provide gender-neutral language options: Offer gender-neutral language options for students who prefer not to identify with traditional gender categories. For example, use the pronouns "they" and "them" instead of "he" or "she." This can help create a more inclusive learning environment for non-binary and genderqueer individuals.
4. Encourage diverse representation in language materials: Use language materials that reflect the diversity of the Arabic-speaking world, including images, videos, and audio recordings featuring people of different genders, ages, and backgrounds. This can help beginner Arabic speakers see themselves represented in the language learning process and feel more included.
5. Address power dynamics: Beginner Arabic speakers may encounter power imbalances within their learning environments or communities. Be mindful of these dynamics and work to create a safe and respectful space for all learners, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Encourage active listening, mutual respect, and inclusive decision-making processes.
6. Provide accommodations for diverse needs: Recognize that beginner Arabic speakers may have diverse learning needs, such as language learning difficulties, mental health concerns, or accessibility requirements. Offer appropriate accommodations to ensure that all learners can participate fully in the language learning process.
7. Engage with marginalized communities: Collaborate
