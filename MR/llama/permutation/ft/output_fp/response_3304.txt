Promoting the social inclusion of Native American recent immigrants in upper lower middle-income communities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for community leaders, educators, and service providers to help them understand the customs, beliefs, and values of Native American communities. This training can help build bridges between Native American immigrants and mainstream society.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services such as translation and interpretation services, and language classes for Native American immigrants who may not speak English fluently.
3. Community Outreach and Engagement: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to raise awareness about the challenges faced by Native American immigrants. This can include organizing cultural events, workshops, and conferences that bring together community members from different backgrounds.
4. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that connect Native American immigrants with experienced professionals who can provide guidance and support in navigating the US social and economic systems.
5. Economic Empowerment: Provide economic empowerment opportunities such as job training, career counseling, and access to small business loans or entrepreneurship programs. This can help Native American immigrants build financial stability and independence.
6. Education and Advocacy: Advocate for policies that address the unique needs of Native American immigrants in education settings. Provide educational resources and support services to help them succeed academically and socially.
7. Healthcare Access: Ensure access to culturally competent healthcare services that cater to the specific health needs of Native American communities.
8. Housing and Urban Development: Work towards providing affordable and culturally appropriate housing options for Native American immigrants, particularly in areas with high rent burdens.
9. Civic Engagement: Encourage civic engagement and political participation among Native American immigrants by providing voter registration drives, civic education workshops, and advocacy opportunities.
10. Intersectional Advocacy: Advocate for policies that address the intersections of race, ethnicity, and immigration status
