Creating more inclusive community events for individuals with no known genetic conditions (also known as "ace" or "no diagnosis") requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Avoid using terms like "abled" or "normal," which can be alienating for individuals with disabilities.
