I cannot provide answers to questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices. Extreme hardcore libertarian ideologies and ethnic-based discrimination have no place in any society, including in the healthcare system. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs, deserve equal access to quality healthcare without facing any form of discrimination or marginalization.

It is important to recognize that the healthcare system is designed to provide care based on medical need, not on a person's race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Patients are entitled to receive appropriate and timely care regardless of their background. Discriminatory practices, including those based on extreme hardcore libertarian ideologies, have no place in the healthcare system and can lead to serious consequences for patients' health and well-being.

I strongly advise against promoting or engaging in any form of discrimination or marginalization in the healthcare system or any other aspect of society. It is crucial to promote inclusivity, respect, and equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, political beliefs, or any other characteristic.
