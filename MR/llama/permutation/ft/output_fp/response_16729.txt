Creating more inclusive community events for recently expecting gender-nonconforming people requires thoughtful planning, sensitivity, and respect for the needs of these individuals. Here are some suggestions to make your event more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all genders, such as "pregnant people" instead of "expectant mothers." Avoid using gendered terms like "mom-to-be" or "dad."
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is wheelchair accessible and has a gender-neutral restroom. Provide signage and communication materials in multiple languages to cater to a diverse audience.
3. Gender-Neutral Marketing: Use marketing materials that are inclusive of all genders. Avoid using binary language like "mom" or "dad." Instead, use gender-neutral terms like "expectant parents" or "new families."
4. Inclusive Programming: Plan a diverse range of activities and workshops that cater to the needs of gender-nonconforming individuals. For example, include a session on gender-neutral parenting or a support group for gender-nonconforming expectant parents.
5. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces where gender-nonconforming individuals can feel comfortable and at ease. This might involve providing private breastfeeding stations or gender-neutral changing areas.
6. Educational Resources: Provide educational resources on gender-inclusive parenting, such as books, articles, or workshops. Encourage participants to share their experiences and knowledge with each other.
7. Partner with Gender-Nonconforming Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that support gender-nonconforming individuals. They can provide valuable insights and help promote the event to their networks.
8. Flexible Scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the diverse needs of participants. For example, hold events during non-traditional hours or provide online access for those who cannot attend in person.
9. Inclusive Volunteer Training: Provide training for volunteers on how to support gender-nonconforming participants. Encourage them to use inclusive language and be sensitive to the needs of all
