Creating inclusive community events for active-duty beginner French speakers requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Provide language support: Offer translation services or provide materials in both French and English to help beginners follow along. You could also hire interpreters or provide audio descriptions for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Make it interactive: Incorporate activities that encourage participation and interaction among attendees, such as group discussions, role-playing exercises, and cultural events. This will help beginners feel more comfortable and engaged in the community.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that may be offensive or exclusive to certain groups. Use gender-neutral language and avoid assumptions about participants' identities or backgrounds.
4. Be flexible: Accommodate different learning styles and needs by offering a variety of activities and resources. For example, provide both visual and written materials for beginners who prefer different ways of learning.
5. Recruit diverse volunteers: Assemble a team of volunteers who reflect the diversity of your community. This will help create a more inclusive environment and ensure that beginners feel seen and heard.
6. Offer childcare and other support services: Provide childcare or other support services for participants who may have dependents. This can help them feel more comfortable attending events and participating in activities.
7. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that your event locations are wheelchair accessible and provide accommodations for participants with disabilities, such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation or audio descriptions.
8. Promote your events widely: Advertise your events through various channels, such as social media, email lists, and local community centers. This will help attract a diverse group of participants and ensure that beginners feel included.
9. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage participants to share their experiences and stories during events. This can help create a sense of belonging and make the event more enjoyable for everyone.
10. Evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate your events and gather feedback from participants. Use this information to identify areas for improvement and make necessary changes to ensure that your events are inclusive and welcoming
