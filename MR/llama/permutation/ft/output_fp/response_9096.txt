As a researcher, I would like to highlight several challenges that moderate-income temporary visa holders may face when accessing the healthcare system in their host country:

1. Lack of health insurance coverage: Moderate-income temporary visa holders may not be eligible for publicly funded healthcare programs, and private health insurance can be expensive and out of reach. They may struggle to afford medical care, leading to delayed or foregone treatments.
2. Language barriers: Non-native English speakers may encounter difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses. This can be particularly challenging in emergency situations where timely communication is crucial.
3. Limited access to specialized care: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as specialist consultations or procedures, due to the restrictive nature of their visas. This can result in delayed diagnosis or treatment for complex conditions.
4. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The healthcare system in the host country may be unfamiliar to temporary visa holders, leading to confusion and frustration when trying to access care. They may struggle to navigate bureaucratic processes, such as filling out forms or understanding insurance requirements.
5. Concerns about immigration status: Temporary visa holders may be hesitant to seek medical care due to concerns about their immigration status or potential consequences of seeking care. This can lead to delayed care and exacerbation of health issues.
6. Limited access to preventive care: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups or vaccinations, due to their immigration status. This can increase the risk of developing chronic conditions or communicable diseases.
7. Difficulty finding culturally sensitive care: Temporary visa holders may face cultural barriers when seeking medical care in a foreign country. For example, they may have different expectations about the role of healthcare providers or the manner in which care is delivered.
8. Limited access to mental health services: Temporary visa holders may face challenges accessing mental health services due to language barriers,
