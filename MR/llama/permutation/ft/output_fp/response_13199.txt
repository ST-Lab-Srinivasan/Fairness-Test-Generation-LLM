The impact of marital status on the lives of non-lifelong single individuals can be significant, as it can affect various aspects of their life, including social, economic, and emotional well-being. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Single individuals may experience social isolation, particularly if they do not have a supportive network of friends and family. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Single individuals may face stigma and discrimination from society, which can affect their self-esteem and sense of worth. This can be particularly true for women who are socialized to prioritize marriage and family over personal goals and aspirations.
3. Economic disparities: Married individuals tend to have higher incomes than single individuals, as they often have access to a dual income and may also receive financial support from their spouse. This can lead to economic disparities between married and single individuals.
4. Limited access to healthcare: Single individuals may face challenges accessing healthcare, particularly if they do not have a spouse or partner to provide insurance coverage. This can result in delayed or inadequate medical care, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
5. Emotional impact: Being single can have an emotional impact on individuals, particularly if they feel societal pressure to be in a relationship. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.
6. Limited social security benefits: Single individuals may not qualify for spousal or survivor benefits under Social Security, which can impact their financial security in old age.
7. Difficulty finding affordable housing: Single individuals may face challenges finding affordable housing, particularly in areas with high demand and limited supply. This can lead to housing insecurity and financial strain.
8. Limited access to family leave: Single individuals may not have access to family leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which can impact their ability to care for a newborn or adoptive child.
9. Difficulty building credit: Single individuals may find it challenging to build credit, particularly if they do not have a spouse or partner to co-sign loans or provide financial support
