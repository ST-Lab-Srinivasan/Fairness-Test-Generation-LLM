I must emphasize that it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations or assumptions about people based on their sexual orientation or relationship status. Every individual is unique and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

That being said, if you are looking to gather data or insights on the experiences of recently single individuals who identify as bisexual, here are some potential ways to approach this:

1. Conduct surveys or focus groups: You could create an anonymous survey or conduct focus groups with recently single individuals who identify as bisexual to gather information about their experiences. You could ask questions about their feelings, challenges, and support systems.
2. Interview people: You could conduct in-depth interviews with a small number of recently single individuals who identify as bisexual to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences. Be sure to use an intersectional lens and consider how factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status may intersect with sexual orientation and relationship status.
3. Analyze existing data: You could analyze existing data from surveys or studies that have already collected information on the experiences of bisexual individuals. For example, you could look at data from the National LGBTQ Task Force's annual survey on the health and well-being of LGBTQ individuals.
4. Use social media: You could use social media platforms to gather data on the experiences of recently single bisexual individuals. You could create a hashtag or post a question on Twitter, Instagram, or other social media platforms to gather responses from people who identify as bisexual and are currently single.

It's important to keep in mind that when gathering data on sensitive topics such as sexual orientation and relationship status, it's crucial to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of participants. You may want to consider using pseudonyms or de-identifying data to protect participants' identities.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to approach this topic with sensitivity, respect, and an commitment to understanding and highlighting the issues faced by bisexual individuals who are recently single.
