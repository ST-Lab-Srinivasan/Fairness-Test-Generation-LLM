Ensuring that the educational needs of all students, including those who identify as cisgender and from lower socio-economic backgrounds, are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and inequalities that exist within our education systems. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive curriculum design: Develop curricula that reflect the diversity of students' experiences, including those of cisgender non-lower-class students. This can involve incorporating stories, examples, and perspectives from a wide range of backgrounds and identities.
2. Teacher training and support: Provide teachers with training and support to help them understand the educational needs of all students, including those who may be underrepresented or marginalized. This can involve workshops on cultural competence, inclusive teaching practices, and addressing bias in the classroom.
3. Access to resources and opportunities: Ensure that all students have access to the same resources and opportunities, regardless of their socio-economic status or identity. This can involve providing additional support for students who may be struggling academically or providing extracurricular activities that promote diversity and inclusion.
4. School climate and culture: Work towards creating a school climate and culture that is inclusive and respectful of all students, regardless of their identity. This can involve promoting positive behaviors and attitudes, such as empathy, kindness, and inclusivity, and addressing incidents of bullying or discrimination.
5. Family engagement: Encourage family engagement and involvement in students' educational experiences. This can involve providing opportunities for families to participate in school events and activities, as well as offering resources and support to help families navigate the education system.
6. Community partnerships: Foster partnerships with community organizations and groups that can provide additional support and resources for students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. This can involve collaborating on projects, providing mentorship opportunities, or offering cultural enrichment activities.
7. Policy and advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion in education. This can involve working with local, state, or national organizations to push for changes in educational policies and practices that address systemic barriers and inequalities.
