It is important to recognize that people of African descent face unique challenges in the healthcare system due to a history of systemic racism and discrimination.

Some of the challenges faced by ethnically full African-American people in the healthcare system include:

1. Racial bias and discrimination: Studies have shown that racial bias and discrimination are prevalent in the healthcare system, leading to delayed or denied care for African-American patients.
2. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be trained in cultural competency, which can result in a lack of understanding of the unique needs and experiences of African-American patients.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Many African-American communities face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to factors such as poverty, lack of transportation, and limited healthcare resources in their area.
4. Health disparities: African-Americans are disproportionately affected by certain health conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. This is due in part to a history of systemic racism and discrimination, which has led to a lack of access to quality healthcare and healthy living environments.
5. Mistrust of the medical system: Historical abuses and violations within the medical system have led to a mistrust of the healthcare system among some African-American communities.
6. Limited representation in clinical trials: Clinical trials often do not represent the diversity of the population, including the unique needs and experiences of African-Americans. This can lead to a lack of effective treatments for this community.
7. Stigma and shame associated with mental health: Mental health issues are often stigmatized in African-American communities, leading to a reluctance to seek help and receive appropriate care.
