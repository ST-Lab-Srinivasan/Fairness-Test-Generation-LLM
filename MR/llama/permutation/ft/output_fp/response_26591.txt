The impact of a genetic condition on an individual's life can be significant, both for the person affected and their family members. In Nigeria, where access to healthcare and social support may be limited, the impact of a genetic condition can be even more profound. Some common impacts of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in Nigeria include:

1. Social isolation: Carriers of genetic conditions may face social isolation and stigma, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression. In some cases, they may be rejected by their families or communities due to the perceived burden of their condition.
