The impact of military service on the lives of lifelong single individuals over the age of 90 (or 85) can vary greatly depending on a range of factors, including the individual's personal experiences, health status, social support networks, and cultural background. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Physical and mental health: Military service can have significant physical and mental health impacts, particularly for those who served in combat zones or experienced traumatic events during their service. Older veterans may experience ongoing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions.
2. Social isolation: Lifelong single individuals over the age of 90 (or 85) may experience social isolation, particularly if they have lost their spouses or partners due to aging or death. Military service can exacerbate this isolation, as veterans may feel disconnected from civilian life and struggle to form new connections with non-veteran peers.
3. Financial challenges: Older veterans may face financial challenges, particularly if they have not saved enough for retirement or have experienced a decline in their physical health that limits their ability to work. Military service may provide some financial support, but it can also lead to reduced income due to disability or medical conditions.
4. Homelessness: Unfortunately, some older veterans may experience homelessness, particularly if they lack access to adequate housing or support services. This can be a significant challenge for individuals over the age of 90 (or 85), as they may face physical and mental health challenges that make it difficult to secure stable housing.
5. Lack of recognition: Older veterans may feel that their service has been overlooked or undervalued, particularly if they served during a time of conflict or crisis when their contributions were not widely recognized. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from society.
6. Difficulty adapting to civilian life: Military service can shape an individual's identity and sense of purpose, making it challenging to adjust to civilian life after retirement. Older veterans may struggle to find meaningful activities or connections in their post-military lives.
7. Legacy impacts:
