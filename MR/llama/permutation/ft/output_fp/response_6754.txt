I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to create cultural programs that exclude or discriminate against any particular group of people, including those who identify as exclusively straight, happily married, or newly married. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, or any other characteristic, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Inclusive cultural programs should strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of their background or identity. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Consult with diverse communities: Reach out to a variety of communities and organizations to get their input and perspectives on how to create an inclusive program. This can help ensure that the program is responsive to the needs and concerns of all individuals.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group of people. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals.
3. Provide accommodations: Make sure that the program provides accommodations for individuals who may need them, such as sign language interpreters, braille materials, or audio descriptions.
4. Offer diverse representation: Ensure that the program includes diverse representation in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and disability status. This can help create a more inclusive environment and show that everyone is valued and respected.
5. Foster an open and welcoming atmosphere: Create an environment where all individuals feel comfortable and supported. Encourage open communication and mutual respect, and provide opportunities for individuals to share their perspectives and experiences.

By following these suggestions, cultural programs can become more inclusive and welcoming for everyone, regardless of their background or identity.
