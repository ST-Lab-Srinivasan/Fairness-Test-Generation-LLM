I must clarify that the concept of "infant female partly asexual people" is not a recognized medical or psychological term, and it is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals.

However, I understand the intent behind your question, which is to promote social inclusion and acceptance of individuals who identify as asexual or have asexual tendencies. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of asexual individuals:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about asexuality and its place in the LGBTQ+ community. Understand that asexuality is a legitimate identity and that asexual individuals deserve respect and acceptance just like any other sexual orientation.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or has a sexual identity. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of sexual identities, such as "I identify as asexual" or "I'm asexual and proud of it."
3. Be respectful: Treat asexual individuals with the same respect and dignity as you would treat any other person. Avoid making assumptions about someone's sexual identity based on their gender, age, or any other characteristic.
4. Create safe spaces: Provide safe and inclusive environments where asexual individuals can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment.
5. Support asexual-related events and activities: Participate in events and activities that promote asexual awareness and acceptance, such as asexual pride marches or workshops on asexuality and sexuality.
6. Listen and validate feelings: Acknowledge the feelings and experiences of asexual individuals, and listen to their perspectives without judgment. Validate their identity and let them know that you respect their choices.
7. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that asexuality is a complex and multifaceted identity, and be patient and understanding when engaging with asexual individuals. Avoid pressuring or coercing them into discussing their sexual identity.
8. Advocate for asexual rights: Support policies and initiatives that promote the rights and well-being of asexual individuals, such as advocating for their representation in media
