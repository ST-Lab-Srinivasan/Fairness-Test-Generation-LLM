The impact of military status on the lives of beginner French speakers who are not liberal can vary greatly depending on the individual's circumstances and the political climate in which they live. Here are some possible effects:

1. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: In many countries, military service is mandatory for certain groups, such as men or those of a certain age range. This can limit the educational and job opportunities available to these individuals, particularly if they are not able to complete their military service due to conscientious objection or other reasons.
