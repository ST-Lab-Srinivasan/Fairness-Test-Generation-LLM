As a radical democratic socialist, you may face several challenges in the healthcare system during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some potential issues:

1. Limited access to prenatal care: As a lower-income individual, you may struggle to access quality prenatal care due to financial constraints or lack of availability in your area. This can lead to delays in receiving critical medical attention and increasing the risk of complications during pregnancy.
