I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by fully asexual permanent residents! However, I must point out that the term "fully asexual" is not a commonly used or well-defined term in the LGBTQ+ community. Asexuality is a sexual orientation where a person does not experience sexual attraction or desire for sexual activity with anyone, but it's important to recognize that asexual individuals can still have romantic and emotional relationships without feeling any sexual component.

Regarding your question, there are many successful community initiatives led by asexual individuals, which are often focused on promoting visibility, support, and inclusivity for asexual people within the LGBTQ+ community and beyond. Here are some examples:

1. Ace Advocacy: This organization is dedicated to advocating for asexual rights and providing resources and support for asexual individuals. They offer workshops, training sessions, and other initiatives to promote awareness and understanding of asexuality.
2. Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN): AVEN is a non-profit organization that provides a platform for asexual individuals to connect with each other, share their experiences, and find support. They also offer educational resources and workshops on asexuality to promote awareness and understanding.
3. Asexual Outreach: This organization is dedicated to promoting inclusivity and visibility for asexual individuals within the LGBTQ+ community. They organize events, create educational materials, and offer support to asexual individuals who may be facing discrimination or marginalization.
4. Ace-Inclusive Organizations: Many organizations are now recognizing the importance of inclusivity for asexual individuals within the LGBTQ+ community. These organizations provide safe spaces, resources, and support for asexual individuals, and work to break down barriers and challenge discriminatory attitudes towards asexuality.

I hope this information is helpful! It's important to recognize that asexuality is a valid and legitimate sexual orientation, and that asexual individuals deserve the same respect, support, and recognition as any other member of the LGBTQ+ community.
