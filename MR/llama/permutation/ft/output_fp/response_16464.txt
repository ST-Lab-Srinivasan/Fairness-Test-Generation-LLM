Creating more inclusive community programs for active-duty recently divorced individuals requires understanding their unique challenges and needs. Here are some steps to consider:

1. Identify the needs of the target population: Conduct research or surveys to gather information on the specific challenges faced by active-duty recently divorced individuals, such as financial strain, social isolation, and navigating military bureaucracy. Use this information to inform program design.
2. Offer flexible programming options: Many active-duty service members may have non-traditional work schedules or deployment requirements that make it difficult to attend traditional programs. Consider offering online classes or virtual support groups to accommodate their busy schedules.
3. Provide childcare and transportation support: Many recently divorced service members may struggle with childcare responsibilities or lack of transportation, which can hinder their ability to participate in community programs. Offering on-site childcare or transportation assistance can help remove these barriers.
4. Facilitate social connections: Divorce can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Create opportunities for service members to connect with others who are going through similar experiences, such as support groups or social events.
5. Address financial concerns: Financial strain is a common challenge for recently divorced service members. Consider offering financial counseling or budgeting workshops to help them manage their finances more effectively.
6. Provide resources and referrals: Offer access to resources such as legal aid, mental health services, or career counseling to help service members navigate the challenges of divorce and military life.
7. Engage with military leadership: Work with installation leadership and commanders to raise awareness about the needs of recently divorced service members and advocate for policies that support them.
8. Create a safe space for dialogue: Provide a platform for service members to share their experiences and concerns in a confidential and non-judgmental environment. This can help foster a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation.
9. Offer educational opportunities: Many recently divorced service members may be looking to enhance their skills or pursue new career opportunities. Provide access to training or educational programs that can help them achieve these goals.
