I must clarify that the term "long-term recently widowed" is not a commonly used or recognized term in education. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their personal circumstances.

Instead, you may want to consider the following ways to promote the educational success of female students who have experienced loss, including widowhood:

1. Provide emotional support: Offer counseling services or peer support groups to help students cope with their emotions and deal with any challenges they may be facing.
2. Flexibility in academic requirements: Consider offering flexible academic requirements, such as extensions or modified coursework, to accommodate students who may be struggling due to personal circumstances.
3. Encourage open communication: Create a safe and supportive learning environment where students feel comfortable disclosing their personal situations and asking for help when needed.
4. Offer additional resources: Provide access to tutoring or academic support services, as well as extracurricular activities that can help students develop new skills and interests outside of academics.
5. Celebrate resilience: Acknowledge and celebrate the students' resilience in facing challenges, and provide opportunities for them to share their experiences and learn from one another.

It is important to recognize that each student's experience with loss is unique, and it is crucial to approach each situation with sensitivity and compassion. By providing a supportive and inclusive environment, you can help promote the educational success of female students who have experienced loss.
