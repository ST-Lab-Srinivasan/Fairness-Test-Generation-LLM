Ensuring the educational needs of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly unmarried students, can be achieved through various strategies and approaches. Here are some suggestions:

1. Assess their level: Begin by assessing the students' current level of Chinese proficiency to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and learning goals. This will help you tailor your teaching methods and materials to meet their needs.
2. Use interactive and engaging materials: Unmarried students may have different learning styles and preferences than older learners. Therefore, it's essential to use interactive and engaging materials, such as multimedia resources, games, and activities, to keep them motivated and interested in the language.
