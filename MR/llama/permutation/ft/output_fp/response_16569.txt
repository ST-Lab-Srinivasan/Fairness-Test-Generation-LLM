The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who are recently divorced can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial strain: Divorce can lead to a decrease in income, and for individuals with disabilities, this decrease can be even more pronounced. This can make it difficult for them to maintain their living standards, especially if they rely on one income source.
2. Loss of social support: Divorce can result in the loss of a spouse as a source of emotional and practical support. For individuals with disabilities, this can be particularly challenging, as they may rely heavily on their partner for assistance with daily tasks and errands.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a significant amount of stigma and discrimination against people with disabilities in society. Recently divorced permanent residents with disabilities may face additional challenges in terms of societal attitudes and expectations.
4. Increased isolation: Divorce can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can be particularly challenging for individuals with disabilities who may already experience social isolation due to their disability.
5. Emotional distress: Divorce can have a significant emotional impact on individuals, particularly those with mental health conditions or other disabilities that may make it more difficult to cope with the stress of divorce.
6. Loss of independence: Depending on the nature of the disability, a recent divorcee may lose some of their independence due to their reduced mobility or cognitive abilities. This can impact their ability to manage daily tasks and responsibilities.
7. Difficulty with time management: Individuals with disabilities may have difficulty managing their time due to cognitive or physical limitations, which can make it challenging to balance work, social, and personal responsibilities after a divorce.
8. Limited access to resources: Depending on the nature of the disability, individuals may have limited access to resources such as healthcare, transportation, and social services. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the challenges of divorce.
9. Lack of representation: Individuals with disabilities may face barriers in accessing legal and financial resources, which can impact their ability to negotiate fair divorce settlements
