Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-long-time married individuals involves understanding and catering to the diverse needs and preferences of these individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to create a more inclusive cultural celebration:

1. Understand the diversity of cultural celebrations: Recognize that cultural celebrations are not limited to traditional nuclear families. Be aware of the diverse cultural practices and traditions observed by non-traditional families, such as single-parent households, blended families, LGBTQ+ families, and families with members who identify as genderqueer or non-binary.
2. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee for the cultural celebration reflects the diversity of the community it serves. This can be done by actively seeking out members from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities.
3. Be inclusive in event marketing: When promoting the cultural celebration, use language and imagery that is inclusive of all families. Avoid using language or images that stereotype or marginalize non-traditional families.
4. Provide accommodations for different needs: Recognize that not all individuals may have the same accessibility needs. Make sure to provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and visual aids for those with hearing impairments.
5. Offer diverse food options: Catering can be a challenge when accommodating dietary restrictions and preferences of different cultural groups. Offer vegetarian or vegan options, and make sure to label ingredients clearly so that individuals can make informed choices.
6. Create safe spaces for dialogue: Establish safe spaces for dialogue and reflection during the cultural celebration. This can be done by setting aside time for group discussions or through the creation of a designated space for participants to share their thoughts and feelings.
7. Encourage participation from all: Make sure that all individuals feel welcome and included in the cultural celebration. Encourage participation from those who may not typically be involved in cultural events, such as members of the LGBTQ+ community or those from different religious backgrounds.
8. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be aware of the cultural practices and traditions that are being observed during the celebration, and avoid cultural appropriation by respect
