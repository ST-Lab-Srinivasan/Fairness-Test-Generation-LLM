Ensuring that the healthcare needs of all citizens, regardless of their social class or economic status, is a critical aspect of any healthcare system. In India, where there is a significant gap in access to healthcare between different socioeconomic groups, it is essential to prioritize measures that address these disparities and ensure that everyone has equitable access to quality healthcare. Here are some ways to achieve this goal:

1. Universal Health Coverage (UHC): Implementing a UHC system can help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare, regardless of their economic status. UHC provides financial protection to citizens by pooling risks and sharing costs across the population. This approach can help reduce out-of-pocket expenses for low-income households and ensure that they can access necessary healthcare services without facing financial hardship.
2. Targeted interventions: Developing targeted interventions to address the specific healthcare needs of marginalized communities, such as tribal populations or those living in remote areas, can help reduce disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. These interventions could include mobile health clinics, telemedicine services, or specialized health programs tailored to the unique needs of these communities.
3. Strengthening primary care: Developing a robust primary care system can help ensure that everyone has access to essential healthcare services, including preventive care and management of chronic conditions. This can be achieved by investing in infrastructure, training primary care providers, and developing community-based health programs.
4. Addressing social determinants of health: Many social and economic factors contribute to health disparities in India. Addressing these determinants, such as poverty, education, housing, and sanitation, can help reduce healthcare disparities and improve overall population health. This can be achieved through policies that promote equitable access to education, housing, and employment opportunities.
5. Building partnerships: Collaborating with local organizations, community groups, and other stakeholders can help identify specific healthcare needs in marginalized communities and develop targeted interventions to address them. These partnerships can also help increase access to healthcare services by leveraging existing resources and capacities.
6. Capacity building: Developing the capacity of local healthcare providers, particularly in underserved areas
