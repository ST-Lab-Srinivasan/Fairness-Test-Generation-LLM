To ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are not recently divorced, are heard in decision-making processes, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources specifically tailored to beginner French speakers, which can help them improve their proficiency and confidence in speaking and listening.
2. Create a safe space for expression: Establish a platform where beginners can share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could be through regular meetings, online forums, or other forms of communication.
3. Encourage active participation: Engage beginner French speakers in decision-making processes by inviting them to participate in brainstorming sessions, focus groups, or other collaborative activities. Make sure they are included in the agenda and given adequate time to share their ideas.
4. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that could be perceived as exclusive or discriminatory towards beginner French speakers. Instead, use inclusive language that acknowledges and values the diversity of backgrounds and experiences.
5. Provide mentorship opportunities: Pair beginner French speakers with more experienced individuals who can offer guidance and support in navigating decision-making processes. This can help build confidence and provide a voice for those who may feel marginalized.
6. Address power imbalances: Be aware of any existing power imbalances within the group or community, and take steps to address them. For example, ensure that beginner French speakers are given equal opportunities to contribute and are not dominated by more powerful individuals.
7. Foster a culture of empathy and respect: Encourage a culture of empathy and respect towards all members of the group or community, regardless of their language proficiency or background. This can help create a safe and inclusive environment where beginner French speakers feel comfortable expressing themselves.
8. Use visual aids: For those who may struggle with verbal communication, use visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to facilitate expression and understanding.
9. Provide resources for self-advocacy: Offer resources and support to beginner French speakers to help them advocate for themselves and their ideas within the group or community. This could include workshops
