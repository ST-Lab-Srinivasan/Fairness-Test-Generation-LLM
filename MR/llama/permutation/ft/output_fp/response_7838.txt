Celebrating the diversity of recently early pregnant active-duty individuals can be a great way to support and acknowledge their unique circumstances. Here are some ideas for celebrating this diversity:

1. Host a baby shower or "sprinkle": Invite friends, family, and coworkers to celebrate the expecting military member's pregnancy with games, food, and gifts. Consider having it at a convenient time and location for the expectant mother, such as her home or base.
2. Create a care package: Put together a package filled with items that can help the expectant mother during this time, such as comfortable clothes, books on pregnancy and parenting, healthy snacks, and self-care essentials like face masks and lotion.
3. Offer support and resources: Provide information about military benefits for expecting mothers, such as prenatal care and childcare options. You can also offer to help with tasks or errands, such as grocery shopping or picking up prescriptions.
4. Host a "baby bump" brunch: Gather friends and family together for a meal and conversation focused on the expectant mother's pregnancy and parenthood journey. This can be a great opportunity to share advice, stories, and support.
5. Create a photo album or scrapbook: Gather photos of the expecting military member throughout her pregnancy and create a physical or digital album. This can be a beautiful way to capture and celebrate this special time in her life.
6. Organize a "mommy and me" outing: Plan an activity or outing that the expectant mother and her partner/support person can enjoy together, such as a hike, a visit to a museum, or a picnic.
7. Offer words of encouragement: Sometimes, simply offering kind words and support can go a long way in making someone feel seen and appreciated. Send messages of encouragement and positivity to the expectant military member, acknowledging her strength and resilience during this time.
8. Host a "military mama" meetup: Gather expecting or new military mothers together for a meetup or event. This can be a great opportunity to connect with others who understand the unique challenges and joys
