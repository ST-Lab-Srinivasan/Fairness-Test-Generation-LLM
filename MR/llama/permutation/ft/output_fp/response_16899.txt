As a non-native speaker of Arabic and a member of a non-liberal society, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: If you are not fluent in Arabic, it can be difficult to communicate effectively in a work environment, especially if you are working with Arabic-speaking colleagues or clients.
