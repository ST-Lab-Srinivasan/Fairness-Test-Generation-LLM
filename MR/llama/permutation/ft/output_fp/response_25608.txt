Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recent immigrants to Canada who are not able-bodied individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Consult with recent immigrants and involve them in the planning process to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account. This can help create a celebration that is tailored to their cultural background and abilities.
2. Provide accessible venues and activities: Choose venues and activities that are wheelchair accessible, have easy entry and exit points, and offer accommodations for individuals with different abilities. This can include providing sign language interpreters or audio describers, or offering quiet rooms for those who need a break from the noise.
3. Offer a variety of activities: Offer a range of activities that cater to different interests and abilities, such as visual art exhibits, music performances, dance workshops, and literary readings. This can help ensure that everyone has something they can enjoy and participate in.
4. Provide accessible food options: Ensure that food options are accessible and tailored to the dietary needs of recent immigrants. This can include offering vegetarian or vegan options, providing gluten-free or halal food, or ensuring that there are appropriate utensils for individuals with dexterity challenges.
5. Promote inclusive language: Use inclusive language in promotional materials and during the celebration to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included. This can include using gender-neutral language, avoiding cultural stereotypes, and recognizing the diversity of recent immigrant communities.
6. Incorporate cultural traditions: Incorporate traditional clothing, music, dance, or other cultural elements from recent immigrant communities into the celebration. This can help create a sense of belonging and connection to their new home country.
7. Offer multilingual support: Provide multilingual support during the celebration, such as interpreters or audio describers, to ensure that everyone can participate and understand what is happening.
8. Create a safe space: Create a safe space for recent immigrants to share their experiences and connect with others who may be going through similar challenges. This can help build a sense of community
