Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly single beginner French speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society. For individuals who are learning French and navigating their way through a new cultural context, their cultural heritage can have a profound impact on their identity formation.
