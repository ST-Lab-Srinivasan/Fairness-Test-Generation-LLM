As a neutral AI language model, I must note that both native English speakers and native Arabic speakers can face challenges in the legal system, depending on various factors such as their cultural background, language proficiency, and familiarity with the legal system. Here are some potential challenges that each group may encounter:

Native English Speakers:

1. Language barrier: While English is widely spoken and understood globally, it's possible that native Arabic speakers may struggle to understand or communicate effectively in legal settings where English is the primary language used.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in different countries can have unique cultural practices and norms, which can be unfamiliar to non-native speakers. Native English speakers may find it challenging to navigate these cultural differences when interacting with legal professionals or participating in legal proceedings.
3. Lack of familiarity: Depending on their background and experience, native English speakers may not be fully versed in the legal terminology, procedures, and practices used in other countries. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications during legal interactions.
4. Access to legal resources: Depending on where they reside, native English speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as interpreters, translators, or legal aid services, which could impact their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.

Native Arabic Speakers:

1. Language barrier: As with native English speakers, native Arabic speakers may face challenges in understanding and communicating effectively in legal settings where Arabic is not the primary language used.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in different countries can have unique cultural practices and norms that may be unfamiliar to native Arabic speakers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications during legal interactions.
3. Lack of trust: Depending on their experiences, native Arabic speakers may feel hesitant or distrustful of the legal system in other countries due to cultural or historical factors. This could impact their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on where they reside, native Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as interpreters, translators, or legal aid services, which could impact their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
