As a strong atheist person moving to India, you may face several challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the potential difficulties you may encounter:

1. Lack of legal recognition: In India, there is no explicit legal recognition of atheism as a religion. This means that you may not have the same legal protections and benefits as religious minorities under the law.
2. Blasphemy laws: India has laws that prohibit blasphemy against any religion, including atheism. While these laws are rarely enforced, they can still pose a risk to atheists, particularly in some states where religious sentiments run strong.
3. Discrimination and harassment: As an atheist in India, you may face discrimination and harassment from people who do not share your beliefs. This can range from social exclusion to physical attacks, and may be more pronounced in smaller towns and rural areas where religious sentiment is stronger.
4. Difficulty accessing legal remedies: As an atheist, you may find it difficult to access legal remedies for discrimination or harassment based on your beliefs. This can be due to a lack of legal protections for atheists, as well as the societal stigma against atheism.
5. Limited social and cultural acceptance: Atheism is not widely accepted in Indian society, particularly in some religious communities. This can make it difficult for atheists to find support and acceptance within their communities, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and marginalization.
6. Difficulty finding like-minded communities: As an atheist in India, you may find it challenging to connect with other non-religious individuals who share your beliefs. This can be due to the limited availability of atheist support groups and communities, as well as the societal stigma against atheism.
7. Difficulty navigating religious influences in public spaces: As an atheist, you may find it challenging to navigate religious influences in public spaces such as schools, universities, and government institutions. This can be due to the prevalence of religion in these settings, which may not always be accommodating or respectful of non-religious beliefs.
