Moderate native Chinese speakers may face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: While China has made significant progress in learning English as a second language, there are still many legal professionals who are not fluent in English. This can create challenges for moderate native Chinese speakers who are not proficient in English when interacting with English-speaking judges, lawyers, and other legal professionals.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique cultural context that may not always align with the legal systems of other countries. Moderate native Chinese speakers may need to navigate these cultural differences when interacting with legal professionals from other cultures.
3. Lack of familiarity with legal terminology: Legal terminology can be complex and specialized, even for native Chinese speakers who are fluent in the language. Moderate native Chinese speakers may struggle to understand legal concepts and terminology when interacting with English-speaking lawyers or judges.
4. Limited access to legal resources: In some parts of China, there may be limited access to legal resources, such as legal libraries or online databases. This can make it difficult for moderate native Chinese speakers to research and prepare their cases effectively.
5. Bias and stereotypes: Unfortunately, there are still instances of bias and stereotyping against moderate native Chinese speakers in the legal system. This can lead to unfair treatment and outcomes for these individuals.
6. Difficulty navigating the court system: The court system in China can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with the language and culture of the legal profession. Moderate native Chinese speakers may struggle to understand the procedures and rules of the court, which can lead to difficulties when trying to access justice.
7. Limited representation: In some areas of China, there may be limited availability of legal aid or representation for moderate native Chinese speakers. This can make it difficult for these individuals to access legal services and advice, particularly in complex cases.
8. Lack of trust in the legal system: Moderate native Chinese speakers may have limited trust in the legal system due to a lack of understanding or confidence in the system. This can lead to reluctance to seek legal assistance or navigate the court system
