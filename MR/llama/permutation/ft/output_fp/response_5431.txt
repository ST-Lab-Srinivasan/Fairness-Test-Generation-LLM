Supporting the social inclusion of genderfluid monastic Buddhist people can involve several strategies that promote respect, understanding, and inclusivity. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Education and awareness-raising: Provide education and resources to the wider Buddhist community about gender identity and expression, and the experiences of genderfluid individuals in a monastic setting. This can help create a more understanding and inclusive environment.
2. Accessibility and accommodation: Ensure that monasteries and temples are accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of their gender identity. Provide accommodations such as gender-neutral bathrooms or private spaces for individuals who may feel uncomfortable using shared facilities.
3. Inclusive language and practices: Use language and practice techniques that are inclusive of all genders. For example, use gender-neutral terms when referring to people, and avoid using language that assumes a fixed gender identity.
4. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship and support to genderfluid monastics, helping them navigate their spiritual journey and find resources and communities that can help them feel supported and included.
5. Visibility and representation: Increase the visibility and representation of genderfluid individuals in Buddhist teachings and practices. This can involve featuring genderfluid individuals in Buddhist artwork, literature, and media, or highlighting their experiences and perspectives in Buddhist teachings and discussions.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies and practices within the Buddhist community that promote inclusivity and respect for all genders. This can involve working with monasteries and temples to create more inclusive environments, or advocating for changes in Buddhist teachings and practices to be more inclusive of gender diversity.
7. Creating safe spaces: Create safe and welcoming spaces within the monastery or temple for genderfluid individuals to practice and connect with their spirituality without fear of judgment or discrimination.
8. Building a support network: Help create a support network of other genderfluid individuals within the Buddhist community, providing them with a sense of connection and belonging.
