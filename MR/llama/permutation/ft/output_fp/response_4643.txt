Supporting the civic engagement of independent immigrant or recent immigrant people in the United States can be done through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide access to citizenship resources: Offer workshops, classes, and materials that help them understand the citizenship process, eligibility requirements, and the rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship.
2. Facilitate voter registration: Partner with local election officials to provide voter registration drives specifically targeting independent immigrant communities. This can include organizing events, distributing voter registration forms, and providing language support for those who may need it.
3. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with advocacy groups and community organizations to push for policies that promote the civic engagement of independent immigrants, such as providing pathways to citizenship, protecting their voting rights, and addressing discrimination based on immigration status.
4. Create opportunities for political participation: Organize town halls, public forums, and other community events where independent immigrants can engage with elected officials, candidates, and community leaders. This can help build connections and foster a sense of belonging among this community.
5. Support language access services: Ensure that language barriers do not prevent independent immigrants from participating in the political process by providing language access services such as interpreters, translators, and bilingual poll workers.
6. Provide financial support: Offer grants or other forms of financial assistance to independent immigrant-led organizations working on civic engagement initiatives, such as voter registration drives or community organizing efforts.
7. Cultivate media partnerships: Collaborate with local media outlets to amplify the voices and stories of independent immigrants, highlighting their experiences and perspectives on issues affecting their communities.
8. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms and social media to reach independent immigrant communities, provide information and resources, and facilitate communication and collaboration among community members.
9. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage mentorship and knowledge-sharing between younger and older members of independent immigrant communities, helping to build a sense of community and shared purpose.
10. Celebrate cultural diversity: Organize events
