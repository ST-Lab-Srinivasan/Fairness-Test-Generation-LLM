Creating more inclusive social policies for Mexican strong atheists requires acknowledging and addressing the unique challenges that they face due to their lack of religious belief. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize and challenge discrimination: Strong atheists in Mexico may face discrimination and prejudice, particularly from religious groups. Social policies should actively work to challenge these attitudes and promote tolerance and respect for non-believers.
2. Protect freedom of religion: The Mexican Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of thought and expression, including the freedom to not hold any religious beliefs. Social policies should ensure that this right is protected and respected.
3. Promote critical thinking and science education: Encouraging critical thinking and scientific literacy can help combat misinformation and superstition, which are often perpetuated by religious groups. Education policies should prioritize science and reasoning-based curricula.
4. Support non-religious community building: Strong atheists may feel isolated or excluded from social and cultural activities due to their lack of religious beliefs. Social policies should promote the development of non-religious community groups and events that foster inclusive social connections.
5. Address economic inequality: Many strong atheists in Mexico face economic inequality, which can be exacerbated by discrimination and marginalization. Social policies should aim to address these disparities through progressive economic measures, such as increased access to education and job training.
6. Encourage inclusive language and representation: Language policies should promote the use of inclusive language that respects the non-religious identity. Additionally, media and cultural representations should reflect the diversity of atheist experiences and perspectives.
7. Advocate for legal recognition: Strong atheists in Mexico may face legal challenges due to their lack of religious beliefs. Social policies should advocate for the recognition of non-religious identities and rights, such as the right to identify as "non-religious" on official documents.
8. Foster dialogue and understanding: Encouraging dialogue and mutual understanding between religious and non-religious individuals can help build bridges of respect and empathy. Social policies should promote interfaith and cross-cultural exchange programs
