To ensure that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who are not long-time married individuals, are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically tailored to the needs of beginner English speakers. This could help build their confidence and ability to communicate effectively in English.
2. Use visual aids: Incorporate visual aids, such as pictures, diagrams, or videos, into decision-making processes to help beginners understand complex concepts more easily.
3. Simplify language: Use simple language and avoid technical jargon when communicating with beginner English speakers. This will help them understand the information better and feel more included in the decision-making process.
4. Encourage participation: Create a safe and inclusive environment where beginner English speakers feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Use non-verbal cues, such as nodding or smiling, to show that you are listening and value their input.
5. Provide feedback: Offer constructive feedback on how to improve their communication skills, which can help build their confidence and encourage them to participate more actively in decision-making processes.
6. Use analogies: Analogies can be a helpful tool for beginner English speakers to understand complex concepts by relating them to something they are already familiar with.
7. Break down information: Break down information into smaller, manageable chunks, and present it in a logical and sequential manner to help beginners follow along and understand the decision-making process better.
8. Provide examples: Use concrete examples that beginner English speakers can relate to, to illustrate complex concepts and make them more accessible.
9. Encourage collaboration: Pair beginner English speakers with more experienced individuals, who can act as mentors or coaches, to help them feel more confident and involved in the decision-making process.
10. Be patient: Remember that beginner English speakers may need more time to process information and communicate their thoughts effectively. Be patient and give them the time they need to contribute meaningfully to decision-making processes.

By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that the voices of beginner English speakers are heard in decision-making processes and that they feel included and valued.
