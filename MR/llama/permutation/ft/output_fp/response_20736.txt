Individuals in their late 30s who have a genetic condition may face various challenges when seeking employment. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Health issues: Many genetic conditions can cause chronic health problems, such as pain, fatigue, or respiratory issues. These symptoms can make it difficult to maintain a regular work schedule, leading to missed days or absences. Employers may view this as unreliability, which could affect job opportunities.
2. Limited career options: Some genetic conditions may limit an individual's ability to perform certain tasks or work in specific environments. For example, someone with a condition that affects their hearing might have difficulty working in a noisy environment. This can limit their career choices and lead to frustration.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding genetic conditions. Some employers may be hesitant to hire someone with a genetic condition due to concerns about the cost of accommodating their needs or fears of potential litigation. This can lead to discrimination and make it harder for individuals to find employment.

7. Difficulty finding appropriate accommodations: Depending on the nature of the genetic condition, individuals may require specific accommodations to perform their job duties. However, finding employers who are willing and able to provide these accommodations can be challenging.
8. Limited access to benefits: Some employers may not offer the same level of benefits for individuals with genetic conditions, which can impact their overall well-being and
