Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who are not recently widowed and are at an early stage of learning English. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, practices, and artifacts that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community.

For non-native English speakers, their cultural heritage can have a profound impact on their identities, as it influences how they perceive themselves, their place in society, and their interactions with others. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of not recently widowed beginner English speakers:

1. Sense of belonging: Individuals' cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For example, a person from a collectivist culture may feel more comfortable in a group setting and may rely on their family and community for support, while an individual from an individualistic culture may prioritize personal freedom and autonomy.
2. Values and beliefs: Cultural heritage shapes individuals' values and beliefs, which can influence how they approach learning a new language like English. For instance, someone from a culture that values respect for elders may be more likely to defer to their teachers or peers when learning a new language.
3. Communication styles: Different cultural heritages have distinct communication styles, which can affect how individuals interact with others in English. For example, people from high-context cultures (e.g., Japan) may rely more heavily on nonverbal cues and indirect communication, while those from low-context cultures (e.g., the United States) may prefer direct and explicit communication.
4. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals form their identities, including their self-concept, values, and beliefs. For instance, someone from a culture that emphasizes collectivism may see themselves as part of a larger group, while an individualist may prioritize personal goals and aspirations.
5. Interactions with others: Cultural heritage can shape how individuals interact with others in English, including their communication patterns, social behaviors, and attitudes towards authority figures. For example, someone from a culture that values hierarchy and respect for authority may be more likely to address teachers or elders
