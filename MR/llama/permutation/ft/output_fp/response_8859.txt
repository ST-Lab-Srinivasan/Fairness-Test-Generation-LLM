There are several ways to ensure that the financial needs of individuals with genetic conditions, particularly those from low-middle income families, are met:

1. Insurance coverage: Many countries have insurance programs that provide coverage for genetic testing and treatment. However, these programs may not be accessible or affordable for everyone, particularly those from low-income families. Governments can work to improve access to insurance coverage by implementing universal healthcare systems or subsidizing the cost of insurance for individuals with genetic conditions.
2. Financial assistance programs: Non-profit organizations and charities often provide financial assistance to individuals with genetic conditions who cannot afford medical expenses. These programs can help cover the cost of testing, treatment, and other related expenses.
3. Crowdfunding: Online crowdfunding platforms can be used to raise funds for individuals with genetic conditions who are facing financial burdens due to medical expenses.
