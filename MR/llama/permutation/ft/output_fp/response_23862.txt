Upper lower-middle-income individuals encounter several legal difficulties in their third trimester of pregnancy. Some of these difficulties include:

1. Lack of access to prenatal care: Upper lower-middle-income individuals may face hurdles in obtaining adequate prenatal care, which can result in poor pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and child. This is due to a lack of access to healthcare facilities or financial constraints that prevent them from seeking proper medical attention.
2. Limited social support: Upper lower-middle-income individuals may have limited social support networks, making it more challenging for them to navigate the legal system during their pregnancy. They may not have access to emotional or practical help, such as transportation or childcare, which can make it difficult to attend court hearings or other legal appointments.
3. Discrimination: Pregnant women in upper lower-middle-income countries may encounter discrimination based on their pregnancy status, particularly if they are from marginalized groups such as racial or ethnic minorities. This can result in unequal treatment under the law and make it more difficult for them to access legal resources.
4. Limited access to legal aid: Upper lower-middle-income countries may have limited access to legal aid services, making it challenging for pregnant women to obtain legal representation or advice during their pregnancy. This can result in a lack of understanding of their legal rights and options, which can negatively impact their well-being and that of their child.
5. Limited awareness of legal rights: Pregnant women in upper lower-middle-income countries may be unaware of their legal rights during pregnancy, particularly if they have limited access to legal resources or education. This can result in a lack of understanding of the laws surrounding pregnancy and childbirth, which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and child.
6. Limited access to healthcare professionals: Upper lower-middle-income countries may have a shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly obstetricians and gynecologists, making it challenging for pregnant women to receive adequate medical care during their pregnancy. This can result in poor pregnancy outcomes or complications that could have been avoided
