As a native English speaker and beginner Spanish speaker, there may be several challenges you face when interacting with the legal system in a non-English speaking country. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge is the language barrier. As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who speak little or no English. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and missed opportunities.
2.
