The impact of military status on the lives of non-libertarian, non-upper middle-income individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited job opportunities: Military service members may face challenges finding employment upon returning to civilian life due to the lack of transferable skills or experience. This is particularly true for those who have served in specialties that are not directly applicable to civilian life, such as cryptography or military engineering.
2. Financial strain: Military service members may struggle with financial difficulties, including debt and limited access to affordable housing, healthcare, and other essential services. This can be particularly challenging for those who have served multiple tours of duty or who have been injured in combat.
3. Mental health concerns: Military service members may experience mental health issues related to their service, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. These conditions can be difficult to treat and may impact an individual's ability to function in civilian life.
4. Social isolation: Military service members may feel disconnected from their civilian communities, leading to feelings of loneliness and social isolation. This can be particularly challenging for those who have served multiple tours of duty or who have been deployed for extended periods of time.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, military service members may face stigma and discrimination from their civilian peers, which can impact their mental health and overall well-being. This can be particularly true for those who have served in combat or who have been injured in service.
6. Limited access to education and training: Military service members may face limited access to educational and training opportunities, particularly those that are not directly related to their military specialty. This can make it difficult for them to transition into civilian life and find employment that matches their skills and abilities.
7. Deployment and separation from family: Military service members who have been deployed may experience difficulties in maintaining relationships with their spouses and children, particularly if they are separated by distance or time. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from family life.
8. Lack of support networks: Military service members may find it difficult to establish and maintain support networks outside of the military, which can impact
