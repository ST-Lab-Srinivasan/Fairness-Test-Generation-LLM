The impact of immigration status on the lives of long-term, recently undocumented natural-born Indian citizens can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Fear and anxiety: Living in a constant state of fear and uncertainty due to their immigration status can take a toll on their mental health and overall well-being. They may feel anxious about being deported, separated from their families, or losing their jobs.
2. Limited access to basic rights: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when accessing basic rights such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. They may be unable to obtain driver's licenses, open bank accounts, or secure stable housing.
3. Economic insecurity: The uncertainty surrounding their immigration status can lead to economic insecurity, including limited access to financial resources, job security, and social safety nets. They may struggle to make ends meet and provide for their families.
4. Social isolation: Long-term undocumented immigrants may experience social isolation due to their fear of being discovered and deported. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and disconnection from their communities.
5. Lack of access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when accessing healthcare services, including limited access to preventive care, emergency services, and chronic disease management. This can lead to poor health outcomes and a lack of access to necessary medical care.
6. Family separation: Long-term undocumented immigrants may experience family separation due to their inability to obtain legal status for themselves or their dependents. This can lead to emotional distress, loss of financial support, and disruption of family dynamics.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may face stigma and discrimination from their communities, employers, and government agencies. This can lead to feelings of shame, humiliation, and marginalization.
8. Difficulty navigating legal systems: Navigating complex legal systems can be challenging for undocumented immigrants, particularly those who may not speak the language fluently or have limited access to legal resources. This can lead to delays, mistakes, and a lack of understanding of their rights and options.
