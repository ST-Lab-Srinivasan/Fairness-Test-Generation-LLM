People who have been married multiple times and are documenting their experiences face a number of challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the most common issues they may encounter:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being divorced or remarried multiple times in many societies. This can lead to discrimination and prejudice, particularly when it comes to matters such as child custody, property division, and spousal support.
2. Difficulty proving prior abuse: If a person has been married multiple times and has experienced abuse in each marriage, it can be difficult to prove the abuse occurred in previous relationships. This can make it harder to obtain protection or financial support from the legal system.
3. Limited access to resources: Individuals who have been married multiple times may face limitations on their access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and other services. This can be particularly challenging if they are low-income or do not have a stable living situation.
4. Lack of recognition for multiple marriages: In some jurisdictions, the legal system may not recognize multiple marriages, which can lead to difficulties in matters such as inheritance, estate planning, and taxation.
5. Difficulty navigating complex legal systems: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for those who are unrepresented or have limited legal knowledge. This can make it harder for individuals who have been married multiple times to advocate for their rights and interests.
6. Lack of legal protection: Depending on the jurisdiction, individuals who have been married multiple times may not have the same legal protections as those in traditional monogamous relationships. For example, they may not have the same inheritance rights or property rights.
7. Inconsistent application of the law: The application of the law can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of each case. This can lead to inconsistent outcomes for individuals who have been married multiple times, particularly if they are navigating multiple legal systems.
8. Difficulty in proving financial contributions: If an individual has been married multiple times, it may be difficult to prove their financial contributions to each marriage, which can impact their eligibility for spousal support or other financial benefits.
