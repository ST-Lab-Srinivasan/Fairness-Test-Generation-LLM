As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "mixed African-American" is not a recognized ethnicity or racial category in the United States.

However, I understand that you are asking about the challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers who are mixed race in the legal system. Here are some potential challenges they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: Depending on their level of proficiency in Spanish, beginner Spanish speakers may face difficulties communicating with Spanish-speaking law enforcement officers or court interpreters, which could lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.

3. Stereotyping and bias: Unfortunately, stereotypes and biases against mixed race individuals still exist in many societies, including the US. These biases can influence the way legal officials interact with them, and they may face discrimination or prejudice based on their racial identity.

These emotional challenges can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
6. Difficulty navigating multiple identities: Mixed race individuals may face challenges navigating their multiple identities (e.g., racial, ethnic, cultural) within the legal system. They may feel pressure to choose one identity over another or face discrimination based on their intersectional identity.
