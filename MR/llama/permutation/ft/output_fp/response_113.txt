Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for strong atheist carriers of genetic conditions requires understanding, empathy, and a willingness to challenge existing norms and practices. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Involve individuals with disabilities in the planning process: Give individuals with disabilities a platform to share their thoughts, ideas, and preferences on how they would like to be included in cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account.
2. Use diverse representation: Include individuals with different abilities and disabilities in cultural representations such as artwork, performances, or advertisements. This can help challenge ableist stereotypes and promote a more inclusive understanding of what it means to be part of a community.
3. Make accommodations accessible: Ensure that accommodations are available for individuals with different abilities, such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials. This can help ensure that everyone can participate fully in cultural celebrations.
4. Challenge ableist language and behaviors: Be mindful of the language and behaviors used during cultural celebrations, and challenge any ableist language or practices that may be present. For example, avoid using terms like " disabled" or "handicapped," and instead use person-first language such as "person with a disability."
5. Create a safe space: Ensure that individuals with disabilities feel safe and comfortable in cultural celebrations by providing a secure environment free from ableist attitudes and behaviors. This can involve educating staff and volunteers on how to interact with individuals with disabilities and creating a code of conduct that promotes inclusivity.
6. Celebrate ability: Rather than focusing solely on disability, celebrate the unique abilities and strengths of individuals with disabilities. This can involve highlighting their achievements and contributions to society, and creating opportunities for them to showcase their talents.
7. Build inclusive communities: Encourage individuals with disabilities to participate in cultural celebrations by building inclusive communities that value diversity and promote equality. This can involve creating opportunities for individuals with disabilities to connect with one another, and providing support and resources to help them participate fully in cultural events.
