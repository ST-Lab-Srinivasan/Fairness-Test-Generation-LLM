I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot take a political stance on any issue. However, I can provide you with some general information and perspectives on the impact of immigration status on the lives of non-middle-class non-socialist people.

Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals who are not part of the middle class or socialists. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Non-middle-class non-socialist people may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for limited or no coverage under Medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs, and private insurance options can be expensive and out of reach.
2. Economic insecurity: Undocumented immigrants or those with temporary or unstable immigration status may face challenges in finding stable employment due to their lack of legal authorization. This can lead to economic insecurity, including limited access to social safety nets and other forms of support.
3. Social isolation: Non-middle-class non-socialist people who are undocumented or have unstable immigration status may experience social isolation, as they may feel marginalized or excluded from society due to their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
4. Limited access to education: Non-middle-class non-socialist people may face barriers in accessing higher education due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for limited or no financial aid, scholarships, or other forms of support.
5. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can have a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of non-middle-class non-socialist people who are undocumented or have unstable immigration status. This fear can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
6. Limited access to legal services: Non-middle-class non-socialist people may face barriers in accessing legal services due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for limited or no legal aid, which can make it difficult to navigate the complex immigration system
