Offer flexible scheduling options, transportation assistance, or home-based programs for those who may have difficulty accessing traditional community spaces.

This can be done through social events, support groups, or peer mentoring programs. Encourage them to build relationships and share experiences, promoting feelings of camaraderie and mutual support.
