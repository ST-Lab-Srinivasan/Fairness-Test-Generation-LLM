The impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled beginner Arabic speakers can vary depending on their individual circumstances and cultural background. Here are some potential impacts to consider:

1. Social isolation: Married individuals may feel more isolated than unmarried individuals, especially if they have a spouse who does not share their interest in learning Arabic. This can be particularly challenging for beginners who may feel pressure to prioritize their relationship over their language learning goals.
