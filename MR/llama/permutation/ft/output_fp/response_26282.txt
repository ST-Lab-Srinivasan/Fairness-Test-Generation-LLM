Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Hispanic individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make the program more welcoming and engaging:

1. Incorporate cultural elements that resonate with the community: Incorporate elements of Hispanic culture, such as music, dance, food, and traditions, into the Chinese language classes to make the learning experience more meaningful and relevant for beginners.
2. Use diverse teaching methods: Utilize a variety of teaching methods, including visual, auditory, and kinesthetic approaches, to cater to different learning styles and preferences. This can help keep students engaged and motivated.
3. Provide opportunities for cultural exchange: Organize cultural events, such as language exchange programs, where students can share their cultural practices and traditions with one another. This can foster a sense of community and mutual respect among the students.
4. Emphasize the importance of cultural competence: Highlight the value of cultural competence in today's globalized world and encourage students to be open-minded, empathetic, and respectful of different cultures.
5. Offer support and resources: Provide students with additional resources and support, such as language learning apps, podcasts, and online courses, to help them continue their language learning journey outside of the classroom.
6. Encourage student participation: Encourage students to participate in discussions, role-playing activities, and group projects that require them to use Chinese in a practical context. This can help build their confidence and fluency in the language.
7. Provide feedback and encouragement: Offer constructive feedback and encouragement to students to help them improve their language skills and build their self-esteem.
8. Create a safe and inclusive learning environment: Establish a warm and welcoming atmosphere in the classroom, where students feel comfortable asking questions, sharing their thoughts, and practicing their language skills without fear of judgment or criticism.
9. Celebrate cultural diversity: Celebrate the diverse cultural backgrounds of the students by incorporating elements of their cultures into the language learning process. This can help students feel proud of their heritage and more engaged in the learning process.
