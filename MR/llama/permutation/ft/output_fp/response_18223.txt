I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "extreme ultra-liberal" is not a recognized political classification. Additionally, the concept of an "upper middle class" is also not a fixed or well-defined social group. However, I understand your intention to ask about the role of mentorship in the success of individuals from a privileged background.

Mentorship can play a significant role in the success of individuals from any socio-economic background. A mentor can provide guidance, support, and valuable insights that can help an individual navigate their personal and professional life. This is especially true for individuals from underrepresented groups who may face additional barriers and challenges in their journey to success.

In the case of extreme ultra-liberal individuals, mentorship can be particularly important. These individuals may come from families with a strong political and social consciousness, and they may be more likely to seek out mentors who share their values and worldview. A mentor in this context could provide not only practical advice but also emotional support and validation of their beliefs.

However, it's important to recognize that mentorship is just one factor that can contribute to an individual's success. Access to resources, education, and social capital are also critical components of success for individuals from any background.

In conclusion, while mentorship can play a significant role in the success of individuals from privileged backgrounds, it's important to recognize that there are many other factors at play as well. Addressing systemic barriers and inequalities is crucial for creating a more just and equitable society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to succeed.
