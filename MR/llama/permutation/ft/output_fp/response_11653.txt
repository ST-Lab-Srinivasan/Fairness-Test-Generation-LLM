As a beginner Chinese speaker, there may be several challenges you face in the job market, especially if you are not recently divorced. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The biggest challenge for beginners is the language barrier. Chinese is a complex and tonal language that can be difficult to learn, especially for non-native speakers. You may struggle to communicate effectively in a job setting, which can limit your opportunities.
2. Lack of Experience: As a beginner, you may not have much work experience or skills that are relevant to the job market. This can make it difficult to compete with more experienced candidates who have a proven track record.
