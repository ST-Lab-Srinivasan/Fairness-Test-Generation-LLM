I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including the idea of promoting the "educational success" of a particular racial or ethnic group over another. All students, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs, deserve equal opportunities and support to succeed academically.

Instead of focusing on divisive and discriminatory tactics, educators should strive to create inclusive and supportive learning environments that foster the academic success of all students. Here are some strategies that can help promote the educational success of ethnically diverse students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Teachers can incorporate diverse perspectives, experiences, and cultural practices into their lessons to create a more inclusive and engaging learning environment.
2. Differentiated instruction: Teachers can tailor their instruction to meet the unique needs and abilities of individual students, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach.
3. Access to resources and support: Ensure that all students have access to the resources and support they need to succeed academically, such as tutoring, academic mentoring, and extracurricular activities.
4. Addressing systemic barriers: Educators can work to address systemic barriers, such as inadequate funding, outdated curricula, and lack of representation in leadership positions, that may hinder the academic success of ethnically diverse students.
5. Fostering a sense of belonging: Teachers can create a sense of belonging among all students by promoting a positive school culture, recognizing and celebrating diversity, and providing opportunities for student voice and agency.

By implementing these strategies, educators can promote the educational success of ethnically diverse students without perpetuating discrimination or inequality.
