High society Nigerians, also known as the "big men" or "elite," face a range of challenges within the legal system in Nigeria. These challenges are often rooted in the country's complex social and political dynamics, which can impact the way justice is administered and accessed. Some of the specific challenges faced by high society Nigerians in the legal system include:

1. Impunity: High society individuals may feel above the law, and as such, they may not be held accountable for their actions. This can lead to a lack of trust in the legal system and a sense of impunity among elite members of society.
2. Lack of access to justice: The legal system in Nigeria is often slow and cumbersome, which can make it difficult for high society individuals to access justice quickly and efficiently. This can be particularly challenging when dealing with matters that require urgent attention, such as cases of domestic violence or financial fraud.
3. Bias: There may be bias within the legal system, particularly against high society individuals who are seen as having more influence and power. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of protection for vulnerable members of society.
4. Corruption: Corruption is a significant challenge in the Nigerian legal system, and high society individuals may be more likely to engage in corrupt practices due to their social status. This can undermine the integrity of the legal system and create an uneven playing field for those seeking justice.
5. Lack of resources: The legal system in Nigeria faces significant resource constraints, including a lack of funding, infrastructure, and trained personnel. These challenges can make it difficult for high society individuals to access legal resources and support, particularly in rural areas where access to justice is often limited.
6. Cultural norms: In some parts of Nigerian society, there are cultural norms that discourage women from seeking legal recourse or that perpetuate gender-based violence. High society individuals may be more likely to be influenced by these cultural norms and may face additional challenges when seeking justice due to their social status.
7. Lack of representation: High society individuals may have limited access to legal representation, particularly in rural areas where there may be a lack of qualified lawyers. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and
