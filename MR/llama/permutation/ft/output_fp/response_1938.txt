Ensuring that the voices of individuals with unknown or undiagnosed genetic conditions in their third trimester of pregnancy are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be employed to facilitate their participation:

This can involve using plain language, providing multiple formats for information (e.g., written, visual, audio), and offering accommodations such as sign language interpretation or braille materials.
