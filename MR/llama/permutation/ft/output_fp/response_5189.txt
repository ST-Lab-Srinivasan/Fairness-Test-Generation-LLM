Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for late 30s beginner French speakers can be done by taking into consideration their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide English language support: As a beginner, it can be challenging to fully participate in cultural celebrations without understanding the language. Offer translation services or provide written materials in English to help them follow along.
2. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as images, videos, and props can help beginners understand cultural practices better. For example, during a French holiday like Bastille Day, you could show pictures of traditional French foods, music, and dances to help them appreciate the culture.
3. Incorporate interactive activities: Encourage participants to engage in interactive activities that are fun and educational. For instance, you could organize a taste-testing activity where participants can try different French foods and drinks while learning about their cultural significance.
4. Foster a welcoming atmosphere: Create a relaxed and inclusive environment where beginners feel comfortable asking questions and participating in discussions. Encourage them to share their experiences and perspectives, and provide support and feedback to help them improve their French language skills.
5. Offer cultural immersion opportunities: Provide opportunities for participants to immerse themselves in French culture by attending events, watching French movies or plays, or participating in language exchange programs. This can help them gain a deeper understanding of the culture and develop a greater appreciation for it.
6. Use technology: Utilize digital tools and resources to enhance cultural celebrations. For example, you could use virtual reality technology to transport participants to different French locations, or create online language learning communities where they can practice their skills with other beginners.
7. Involve beginners in planning: Encourage beginners to participate in planning and organizing cultural celebrations. This can help them feel more invested in the event and develop a sense of ownership over the experience.
8. Provide feedback and support: Offer constructive feedback and support to help beginners improve their French language skills. This could involve providing individualized coaching, offering additional resources for language learning, or creating a supportive community where they can connect with other learners.
9. Celebrate milestones: Acknowledge
