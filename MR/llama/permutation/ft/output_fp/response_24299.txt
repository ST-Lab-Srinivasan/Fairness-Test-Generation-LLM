Promoting the accessibility of public services for mixed African-American individuals is essential to ensure equal opportunities and inclusivity. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to achieve this:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that acknowledges and respects the identity of mixed race individuals. Avoid using terms like "black" or "white" alone, which can marginalize individuals who do not fit into these categories. Instead, use terms like "mixed-race," "biracial," or "multiracial."
2. Education and Training: Provide training for public service providers on issues related to cultural competency, diversity, and inclusion. This can help them understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by mixed race individuals and provide more effective support.
