Creating more inclusive community events for expecting masculine people requires thoughtful planning and execution. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Inclusive Marketing: Use language and marketing materials that are inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary gender language or making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that your event is physically accessible to people of all abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, gender-neutral restrooms, and sign language interpretation (if needed).
3. Gender-Neutral Language: Use gender-neutral language in your promotional materials and event descriptions. Avoid using binary gender language or making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance.
4. Education and Training: Provide education and training for event staff and volunteers on how to create a welcoming environment for expecting masculine people. This can include information on how to use gender-neutral language, how to respect people's privacy and personal space, and how to handle any conflicts that may arise.
5. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces at your event where expecting masculine people can feel comfortable and relaxed. This can include designated areas for people of all genders to use the restroom or changing facilities without fear of harassment or discrimination.
6. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that is inclusive of all gender identities. This can include workshops, panels, and performances that celebrate diversity and provide a platform for marginalized voices to be heard.
7. Volunteer Recruitment: Recruit volunteers from diverse backgrounds and experiences to help run your event. Ensure that your volunteer recruitment materials are inclusive and welcoming to all genders.
8. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that serve the expecting masculine community. This can include partnering with LGBTQ+ organizations, gender identity clinics, and support groups.
9. Respectful Asking: When asking attendees about their gender identity, be respectful and avoid making assumptions. Use language like "What is your preferred gender pronoun?" or "How would you like me to refer to you?"
