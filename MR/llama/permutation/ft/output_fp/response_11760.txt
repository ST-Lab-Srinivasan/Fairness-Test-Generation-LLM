Introduction:

Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) beginner French speakers. In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of marital status on the lives of these individuals. Specifically, we will examine how marital status affects their emotional well-being, social support, and overall quality of life during this critical period of pregnancy.

Methods:

We conducted a cross-sectional study among early pregnancy beginner French speakers. Participants were recruited through online advertisements and were included if they were between 12 and 16 weeks gestation. We collected data on marital status (single, married, or in a de facto relationship), emotional well-being (using the General Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule), social support (using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), and overall quality of life (using the WHO Quality of Life Index).

Results:

Our sample consisted of 150 participants, with 43% being single, 38% married, and 19% in a de facto relationship. We found that single participants reported higher levels of anxiety and negative affect compared to married and de facto relationship participants. Additionally, single participants reported lower levels of social support compared to married and de facto relationship participants. Finally, we found that single participants reported lower overall quality of life compared to married and de facto relationship participants.

Discussion:

Our findings suggest that marital status can have a significant impact on the emotional well-being, social support, and overall quality of life of early pregnancy beginner French speakers. Specifically, being single during this critical period of pregnancy may lead to increased anxiety and negative affect, as well as lower levels of social support and overall quality of life. These findings highlight the importance of providing support and resources to single individuals during this time, particularly those who may be experiencing emotional distress or feeling isolated.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of early pregnancy beginner French speakers. Specifically, being single during this
