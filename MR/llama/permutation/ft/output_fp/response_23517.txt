As a senior Chinese language instructor, I have taught many beginner Chinese speakers who are over the age of 85. While each individual's experience is unique, there are some common challenges that these older learners may face when learning and using Chinese in a healthcare setting. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

2. Limited mobility: Older adults may experience limited mobility or flexibility, which can make it challenging for them to practice speaking and listening to Chinese. They may also have difficulty moving around the healthcare facility or accessing resources.
3. Hearing and vision loss: Many older adults experience hearing and vision loss, which can impact their ability to understand and communicate in Chinese. They may need additional support or accommodations to compensate for these challenges.
4. Chronic health conditions: Older learners may have chronic health conditions that can affect their learning and participation in language classes. For example, they may experience fatigue, pain, or difficulty concentrating due to medication side effects or underlying health issues.
