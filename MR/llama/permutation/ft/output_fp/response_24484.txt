I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to promote or encourage any form of discrimination or inequality towards any individual or group based on their sexual orientation, including the slightly bisexual temporary visa holder individuals. Everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or immigration status.

Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and diversity in all forms of artistic expression. This can involve creating opportunities for marginalized communities to share their talents and perspectives, providing resources and support for underrepresented artists, and challenging systemic barriers that prevent diverse voices from being heard.

Remember, art is a powerful tool for promoting social change and should be used to break down barriers, rather than perpetuating them. By fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect, we can create a more equitable and just society for everyone.
