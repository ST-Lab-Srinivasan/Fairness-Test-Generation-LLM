As a Buddhist educator, I believe that it's essential to address the specific needs of divorced multiple times monastic Buddhist individuals by providing them with opportunities to learn and practice basic self-taught skills. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Mindfulness meditation: Offer regular mindfulness meditation sessions, tailored to the needs of this group. These sessions can help them cultivate inner peace, stability, and a sense of grounding, which may be particularly helpful after multiple divorces.
2. Basic life skills: Provide workshops or classes on basic life skills such as budgeting, time management, and cooking. These skills are essential for anyone, but especially important for individuals who may have had to rely on others for financial support during their monastic period.
3. Emotional healing: Offer emotional healing workshops or therapy sessions that cater to the unique challenges faced by divorced multiple times monastic Buddhist individuals. These workshops can help them process their emotions, address any trauma or grief they may have experienced, and develop healthy coping mechanisms.
4. Community building: Organize community events or groups that provide a supportive environment for individuals to connect with others who share similar experiences. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to their spiritual community.
5. Personal growth workshops: Offer workshops on personal growth topics such as self-awareness, self-compassion, and setting boundaries. These workshops can help individuals develop a stronger sense of self and improve their overall well-being.
6. Practical skills training: Provide training on practical skills such as computer basics, smartphone usage, and online learning platforms. These skills are essential for staying connected with the world and accessing information and resources that can support personal growth.
7. Spiritual practices: Offer workshops or classes on various Buddhist spiritual practices such as chanting, visualization, and rituals. These practices can help individuals deepen their spiritual understanding and connection to their faith.
8. Intergenerational connections: Facilitate opportunities for divorced multiple times monastic Buddhist individuals to connect with younger generations, such as through mentorship programs or intergenerational events. This can help create a sense of continuity
