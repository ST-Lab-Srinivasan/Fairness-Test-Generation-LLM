I must clarify that the term "documented ethnically full African-American people" is a subjective and problematic classification. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simplistic categories. Additionally, it is important to recognize that notions of "fullness" or "completeness" based on racial or ethnic criteria are not valid or useful.

Instead of focusing on these types of classifications, it is more important to support the civic engagement and political participation of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Voter registration and education: Make sure that all eligible citizens are registered to vote and have access to information about voting rights and procedures. Provide non-partisan voter education resources to help people understand the voting process and make informed decisions at the polls.
2. Civic participation opportunities: Create opportunities for people to participate in civic life, such as volunteering, advocacy, or community organizing. Encourage individuals to take an active role in shaping their communities and addressing social issues.
3. Vote-rich outreach: Focus on areas with high concentrations of racial and ethnic minority populations, and work to increase voter turnout among these groups. Use culturally appropriate language and messaging to reach these communities and help them understand the importance of voting.
4. Redistricting reform: Advocate for fair and impartial redistricting processes to ensure that electoral districts are drawn in a way that respects the rights and representation of all citizens, regardless of race or ethnicity.
5. Campaign finance reform: Work to reduce the influence of money in politics and increase transparency and accountability in campaign financing. This can help to reduce the disparities in political representation and influence that can arise from unequal access to financial resources.
6. Civic engagement programs: Develop and support programs that encourage civic participation, such as voter registration drives, community organizing initiatives, and advocacy campaigns. These programs can help to increase civic engagement and political representation among underrepresented groups.
7. Electoral reform: Advocate for electoral reforms
