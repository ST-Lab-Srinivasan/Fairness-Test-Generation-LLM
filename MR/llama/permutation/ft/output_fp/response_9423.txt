Native Spanish speakers who have recently immigrated to Canada may face several challenges when accessing the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: Many native Spanish speakers may not be fluent in English or French, the official languages of Canada, which can create difficulties when communicating with healthcare providers.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultural norms and values surrounding health and illness can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between healthcare providers and patients.
3. Lack of knowledge about the healthcare system: New immigrants may be unfamiliar with the Canadian healthcare system and its structures, such as how to access care, what services are available, and how to navigate the system.
4. Limited access to healthcare providers who speak their language: In some areas of Canada, there may be a limited number of healthcare providers who speak Spanish, making it difficult for native Spanish speakers to find providers who can communicate with them effectively.
5. Difficulty navigating the system without a healthcare card: Many immigrants may not have a Canadian healthcare card or other proof of coverage, which can make it difficult to access healthcare services.
6. Limited availability of culturally sensitive and appropriate healthcare services: Immigrants may face challenges in accessing healthcare services that are culturally sensitive and appropriate for their needs, particularly if they have specific cultural or religious practices that need to be accommodated.
7. Discrimination or bias: Some immigrants may experience discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can affect their ability to access care.
8. Difficulty in finding a doctor who understands their medical history: Immigrants may have difficulty finding a doctor who is familiar with their medical history and can provide appropriate care.
9. Limited availability of specialized services: Some immigrants may face challenges in accessing specialized healthcare services, such as mental health or cancer care, which may not be available in their area.
10. Difficulty in navigating the system with disabilities: Immigrants with disabilities may face additional challenges in accessing healthcare services, such as lack of accessibility in healthcare facilities or difficulty communicating with providers who do not speak their language.
