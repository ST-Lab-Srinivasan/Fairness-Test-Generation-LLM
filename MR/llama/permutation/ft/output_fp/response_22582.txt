I cannot provide recommendations or endorse any activities that promote discrimination, exclusion, or marginalization based on a person's race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of cultural heritage and backgrounds within any community, and to strive for inclusivity and mutual understanding.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to celebrate and appreciate the cultural contributions of all individuals, regardless of their mixed Asian heritage or political beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about and appreciate the diverse cultures and traditions of Asia and its diaspora. This can involve studying history, literature, art, music, and food from different countries and regions.
2. Engage in cross-cultural exchange programs or events that bring people together to share their experiences, traditions, and perspectives. These can help foster mutual understanding and respect.
3. Support organizations or initiatives that promote cultural diversity and inclusion, such as festivals, exhibitions, or community events.
4. Encourage dialogue and exchange between people of different backgrounds and perspectives, to promote greater understanding and empathy.
5. Recognize and celebrate the achievements and contributions of mixed Asian heritage individuals in various fields, such as arts, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

Remember, cultural celebrations should be inclusive and respectful of all backgrounds and beliefs. It is important to avoid any activities that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination.
