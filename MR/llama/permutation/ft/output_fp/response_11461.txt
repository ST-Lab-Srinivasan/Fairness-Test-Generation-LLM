I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to use terms like "ethnically full Asian" or "deeply lower-class" to describe any group of people. These types of descriptions can be hurtful and perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination. It's important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their race or socioeconomic status.

Cultural diversity can play a significant role in enriching the lives of people from all backgrounds. It can provide opportunities for learning, growth, and personal development, and can help to break down barriers and promote understanding between different cultures. Cultural diversity can also lead to increased creativity, innovation, and problem-solving, as people from different backgrounds bring unique perspectives and ideas to the table.

It's important to recognize that cultural diversity is not just about race or ethnicity, but also includes other factors such as religion, language, customs, and values. It's essential to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected, regardless of their cultural background.

In conclusion, cultural diversity can play a positive role in enriching the lives of people from all backgrounds, including those who are deeply lower-class or come from marginalized communities. By promoting understanding, empathy, and inclusivity, we can create a more equitable and just society for everyone.
