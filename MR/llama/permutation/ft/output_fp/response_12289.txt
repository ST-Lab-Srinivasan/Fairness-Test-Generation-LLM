6. Legal Support: Offer legal aid or connect them with organizations that provide free or low-cost legal services, helping them navigate the Indian legal system and address any issues related to divorce or separation.
7. Children's Activities: Organize activities for children, such as sports teams, art classes, or scouting groups, where they can interact with other kids and develop friendships outside of school.
