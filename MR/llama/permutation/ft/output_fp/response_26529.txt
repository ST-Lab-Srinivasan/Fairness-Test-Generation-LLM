Ensuring that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who may not be lifelong single individuals, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive language learning environments: Design language learning spaces that are welcoming and inclusive for all learners, regardless of their background or level of proficiency. Encourage peer-to-peer learning and provide opportunities for beginners to share their experiences and ideas with more advanced learners.
2. Use diverse teaching methods: Employ a range of teaching methods, including visual, auditory, and kinesthetic approaches, to cater to different learning styles and abilities. This can help ensure that all learners, including those who may struggle with traditional teaching methods, have access to the information they need to participate in decision-making processes.
3. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage learners to view language learning as a continuous process and emphasize the importance of effort and progress, rather than ability or achievement. This can help beginners feel more confident and motivated to contribute their ideas and perspectives in decision-making processes.
4. Provide opportunities for participation: Offer regular opportunities for learners to practice using French in authentic contexts, such as through role-playing exercises or group discussions. This can help beginners build their confidence and fluency, and increase their chances of being heard in decision-making processes.
5. Use technology to facilitate collaboration: Leverage digital tools and platforms to connect learners and provide opportunities for collaboration and communication. For example, use video conferencing software to bring together learners from different locations or create online communities for language learners to share ideas and feedback.
6. Encourage peer support: Pair beginners with more advanced learners or native speakers who can offer guidance and support. This can help beginners build their confidence and feel more comfortable sharing their ideas and perspectives in decision-making processes.
7. Provide feedback and encouragement: Offer constructive feedback and encouragement to learners, particularly those who may be struggling with language acquisition. This can help build their confidence and motivation, and increase their chances of being heard in decision-making processes.
8. Create a safe space for expression
