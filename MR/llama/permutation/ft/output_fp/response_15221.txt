I must politely challenge the assumption in your question. Lifelong single infant male people do not exist, as infants are not capable of having a legal identity or experiencing life events. Additionally, it is not possible for someone to be a "lifelong single" person, as relationships and experiences are an integral part of human life.

In the legal system, individuals are recognized as having their own unique identity and experiences, and are entitled to certain rights and protections under the law. However, these rights and protections are not tied to any particular gender or relationship status.

It is important to recognize that every individual has their own unique identity and experiences, and that they should be treated with dignity and respect in all aspects of life, including the legal system.
