As a native French speaker, there may be several challenges that you may face when communicating in an English-speaking legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge for beginner English speakers is the language barrier. You may struggle to understand legal terminology and concepts, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system.
2. Cultural differences: Legal systems in different countries have different cultural backgrounds, values, and beliefs. As a native French speaker, you may find it challenging to adapt to the cultural nuances of the English-speaking legal system.
3. Vocabulary and terminology: Legal terminology can be complex and technical, and you may struggle to keep up with the speed and complexity of legal discussions.
4. Pronunciation and accent: As a non-native English speaker, you may have difficulty pronouncing certain words or phrases correctly, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
5. Lack of familiarity with legal concepts: The legal system in France is different from the one in the UK or the US, and you may be unfamiliar with certain legal concepts or procedures.
6. Difficulty reading and understanding legal documents: Legal documents can be dense and complex, and you may struggle to read and understand them accurately.
7. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on where you are located, you may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, legal aid organizations, or other support services.
8. Difficulty navigating the court system: The court system in the UK or the US can be complex and confusing, especially for non-native English speakers. You may find it challenging to navigate the different courts and tribunals, and to understand the procedures and rules that apply.
