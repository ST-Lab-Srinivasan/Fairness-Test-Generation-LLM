Some ways that community organizations can support non-sexual left-leaning people include:

1. Providing a platform for political organizing: Community organizations can offer a space for non-sexual left-leaning individuals to mobilize and organize around issues that matter to them, such as advocating for policy changes or supporting social movements.
2. Offering mental health support: Non-sexual left-leaning individuals may face unique challenges, such as stress and burnout, due to their political beliefs and activities. Community organizations can provide mental health resources and support groups to help individuals cope with these challenges.
3. Creating community spaces for connection and dialogue: Community organizations can foster a sense of community and belonging among non-sexual left-leaning individuals by providing safe spaces for conversation, mutual support, and collective action.
4. Advocating for policy change: Community organizations can work towards advocating for policies that promote social justice and equality, such as addressing systemic inequality, promoting access to healthcare, and advancing LGBTQ+ rights.
5. Providing educational resources: Community organizations can offer educational resources and workshops on topics related to social justice, such as intersectionality, privilege, and activism.

It's important to recognize that community organizations play a vital role in supporting non-sexual left-leaning individuals by providing a platform for political organizing, mental health support, community spaces for connection and dialogue, advocacy for policy change, and educational resources. By doing so, these organizations can help create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
