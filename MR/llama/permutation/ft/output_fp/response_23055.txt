Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, especially when they are not part of the dominant language group. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Designate specific times and spaces for beginners to practice speaking and listening in a supportive environment. This could include conversation clubs, language exchange events, or even online platforms.
2. Use visual aids: Provide visual aids such as pictures, videos, or flashcards to help beginners communicate more effectively. This can help them express themselves more confidently and accurately.
3. Encourage participation: Actively seek out the input of beginner English speakers in decision-making processes. Encourage them to share their thoughts and ideas, and provide support and guidance as needed.
4. Build trust: Establish a culture of trust and respect among all participants. This can help beginners feel more comfortable sharing their opinions and perspectives.
5. Use interpreters or translators: When possible, use interpreters or translators to facilitate communication between beginner English speakers and those who are fluent in the dominant language.
6. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage beginners to view mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning. This can help them feel more comfortable speaking and participating in decision-making processes.
7. Provide feedback: Offer constructive feedback to beginner English speakers on their communication skills, focusing on specific areas of improvement rather than criticism.
8. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and inclusive environment where beginners feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or ridicule.
9. Leverage technology: Utilize technology such as language learning apps, online platforms, or video conferencing tools to facilitate communication between beginner English speakers and those who are fluent in the dominant language.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of languages and cultures present in decision-making processes. Encourage participants to share their unique perspectives and insights, and recognize the value of diverse perspectives.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to ensure that the voices of beginner English speakers are heard in decision-making processes, even if they are not part of the dominant language group.
