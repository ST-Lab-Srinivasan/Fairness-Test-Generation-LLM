Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native Arabic speaker immigrant natural-born US citizens, as it shapes their identities, values, and beliefs. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences these individuals:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a larger community and identity.

This sense of belonging can help them navigate their new life in the US and maintain their cultural practices.
2. Language preservation: Many native Arabic speakers are eager to preserve their language and cultural traditions in the US. They may continue to speak Arabic at home, teach it to their children, or participate in Arabic language classes to maintain their cultural heritage.
3. Cultural expression: Cultural heritage can serve as a means of expressing oneself and connecting with others who share similar experiences. For native Arabic speakers in the US, this may involve participating in cultural events, attending mosques or Islamic centers, or joining Arabic language clubs to connect with like-minded individuals.
4. Resilience: Cultural heritage can provide a source of resilience and strength in the face of adversity. For native Arabic speakers who have faced discrimination or marginalization, their cultural heritage can serve as a reminder of their values, traditions, and identity.
5. Intergenerational connections: Cultural heritage can bridge the gap between different generations within immigrant communities. Native Arabic speakers may pass down their cultural practices and language to their children and grandchildren, creating a sense of continuity and connection across generations.
