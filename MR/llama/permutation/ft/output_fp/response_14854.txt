Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting non-socialist employed communities in several ways:

1. Supplementing resources: Volunteers can help supplement the resources of organizations that provide services to marginalized communities, such as food banks, homeless shelters, and after-school programs. This can help bridge the gap between what these organizations can provide and what is needed.
2. Filling gaps: Volunteers can help fill gaps in service provision by addressing specific needs that may not be met by paid staff alone. For example, volunteers may provide one-on-one support to individuals with disabilities or elderly people who need assistance with daily tasks.
3. Building community: Volunteering can help build stronger, more cohesive communities by bringing people together around a shared purpose. This can help foster a sense of belonging and social connection among community members, which is particularly important in non-socialist employed communities where economic disparities may exist.
