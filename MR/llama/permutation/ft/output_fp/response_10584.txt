The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native English-speaking child people can be significant, as political beliefs and values can shape their worldview, social interactions, and future opportunities. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Shaping identity: Children may internalize their parents' political beliefs and values, which can help form their own identity and sense of self. This can be particularly significant during formative years when children are developing their understanding of the world.
2. Social interactions: Political affiliation can influence how child native English speakers interact with others, including their peers and community members. For example, if a child grows up in a family that is politically active, they may be more likely to participate in political discussions or join political organizations.
3. Access to opportunities: Political affiliation can affect access to opportunities such as education, employment, or social services. For instance, children of politically active parents may have access to networking opportunities or exclusive programs that can help them achieve their goals.
4. Views on authority: Children may learn to respect or challenge authority based on their political affiliation. For example, if a child grows up in a family that is critical of government authority, they may be more likely to question authority figures in their own life.
5. Perception of social issues: Political affiliation can shape children's perception of social issues such as poverty, inequality, or discrimination. For instance, if a child grows up in a family that is politically active on these issues, they may be more likely to prioritize them in their own life.
6. Future political engagement: Children who grow up in politically active families are more likely to become politically engaged themselves later in life. This can involve participating in politics, voting, or advocating for certain causes.
7. Influence on peers: Children may influence their peers and classmates based on their political affiliation. For example, if a child is politically active and vocal about their beliefs, they may inspire others to become engaged in politics as well.
8. Impact on mental health: Political affiliation can affect children's mental health, particularly during times of political turmoil or conflict. Children who grow up in politically charged environments may experience stress, anxiety, or feelings of hopelessness
