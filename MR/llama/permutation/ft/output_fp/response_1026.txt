The role of language in the identity of very old (90s+) reservist people can be complex and multifaceted. Here are some possible ways in which language may shape their identity:

1. Connection to cultural heritage: For many older adults, language is a crucial aspect of their cultural heritage. It may be the only remaining connection they have to their ancestral culture, customs, and traditions. As such, it can play a significant role in shaping their identity and sense of self.
2. Sense of belonging: Language can also create a sense of belonging for older adults, particularly those who belong to a particular language or cultural group. For example, a 90-year-old reservist may identify strongly with the Indigenous community and feel a sense of connection to their language and culture, which can be an important aspect of their identity.
3. Nostalgia: Older adults may also associate language with nostalgic memories of their past, such as childhood experiences or historical events. This can create a strong emotional attachment to a particular language or dialect, which can shape their identity and sense of self.
4. Communication and expression: Language is essential for communication and expression, and older adults may rely on it more heavily as they age. It can be a means of connecting with others, sharing experiences, and expressing emotions. As such, it can play a significant role in shaping their identity and sense of self.
5. Resilience and adaptation: Language can also serve as a source of resilience and adaptation for older adults. For example, a 90-year-old reservist may have had to adapt to different languages and cultural practices throughout their life, which can make them more resilient and adaptable overall.
6. Cultural preservation: Older adults may also view language as an important aspect of cultural preservation. They may feel a sense of responsibility to preserve their language and culture for future generations, which can shape their identity and sense of purpose.
7. Intergenerational relationships: Language can also play a role in intergenerational relationships among older adults. For example, a 90-year-old reservist may learn from and teach younger generations about their language and culture, which can strengthen their connection to their identity
