The impact of military status on the lives of long-term, recently widowed, and aged 65 or over (including those over 85) individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial Security: Military pensions and survivor benefits can provide a steady source of income for widows/ers, especially in their golden years. However, this financial security may be threatened if the individual is no longer eligible for these benefits due to age or other factors.
2. Healthcare Access: As people age, their healthcare needs often increase. Military status can provide access to high-quality medical care through the military healthcare system. However, once an individual reaches 65 or older, they may become eligible for Medicare and other federal healthcare programs, which could potentially impact their access to care.

7. Community Support: Military bases often have a strong sense of community and support for
