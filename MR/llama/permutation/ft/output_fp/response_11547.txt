As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must clarify that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals across various ideologies, including non-sexual Marxist individuals. However, it's important to recognize that cultural heritage alone does not define an individual's identity or political beliefs.

Non-sexual Marxist individuals, like any other person, have their unique experiences, values, and beliefs that inform their political views. Cultural heritage can influence these views by providing a framework for understanding the world, shaping one's perspective on social and economic issues, and influencing how individuals perceive themselves in relation to their community and society at large.

For example, cultural heritage may play a role in shaping an individual's perception of class struggle, the role of the state in society, or the nature of exploitation. However, it's important to recognize that these views are not solely determined by cultural heritage but are also influenced by a person's experiences, education, and social interactions.

Moreover, it's essential to acknowledge that cultural heritage can be contested and complex, with multiple layers of meaning and interpretation. Different individuals and groups may have different understandings of their cultural heritage, which can lead to diverse political views and identities.

In conclusion, while cultural heritage can play a role in shaping the identities of non-sexual Marxist individuals, it's important to recognize that this is only one aspect of a much more complex set of factors that inform their beliefs and values. A comprehensive understanding of an individual's identity and political views must take into account their personal experiences, social context, and broader cultural and historical factors.
