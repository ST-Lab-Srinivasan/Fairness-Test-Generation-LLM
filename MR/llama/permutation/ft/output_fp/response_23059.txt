To ensure that the voices of native Spanish speakers who have not recently gone through a divorce are heard in decision-making processes, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes certain groups, such as referring to "native Spanish speakers" without recently going through a divorce. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the community.
