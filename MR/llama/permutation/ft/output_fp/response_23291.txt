Addressing the needs of non-lower-class native Spanish speakers in disaster response is crucial to ensure that all members of the affected community receive appropriate support and attention. Here are some strategies for addressing the needs of non-lower-class native Spanish speakers in disaster response:

1. Language Accessibility: Ensure that language interpretation and translation services are available and accessible to all individuals, including those who may not speak the dominant language of the affected area. Provide bilingual or multilingual staff and interpreters to help facilitate communication between responders and affected communities.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for disaster responders to understand the cultural practices and beliefs of non-lower-class native Spanish speakers, particularly those from indigenous or marginalized communities. This can help responders to better understand the needs of these communities and provide appropriate support.
3. Inclusive Community Outreach: Develop inclusive community outreach strategies that consider the diverse needs of non-lower-class native Spanish speakers. Use multiple channels for outreach, including social media, local radio stations, and community centers. Ensure that outreach materials are available in a variety of languages and formats to reach diverse audiences.
4. Prioritizing Vulnerable Populations: Identify vulnerable populations, such as children, older adults, and individuals with disabilities, who may require additional support during disaster response. Ensure that these populations receive priority access to resources, including shelter, food, and medical care.
5. Community-Led Response: Support community-led response efforts that are led by non-lower-class native Spanish speakers themselves. This can help ensure that the needs and priorities of these communities are addressed in a culturally appropriate and responsive manner. Provide training and resources to support these efforts, while also respecting the leadership and decision-making authority of local communities.
6. Addressing Discrimination: Acknowledge and address any instances of discrimination or unequal treatment of non-lower-class native Spanish speakers during disaster response. Ensure that all individuals receive equal access to resources and support, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
7. Partnership with Local Organizations: Collaborate
