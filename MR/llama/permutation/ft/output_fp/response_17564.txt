To highlight the issues faced by beginner Chinese speakers and beginner Spanish speakers using data, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Create a survey or interview questions that target both groups of language learners (Chinese and Spanish) to gather data on their experiences, challenges, and obstacles. This can help identify common issues across both groups, as well as any unique challenges faced by each group.
2. Analyze language learning patterns: Use data analysis techniques such as frequency analysis or sentiment analysis to examine how learners interact with their target language (Chinese or Spanish). For example, you could analyze the most frequent words used by beginners in both languages to identify any common mistakes or areas of difficulty.
3. Compare learner data: Collect and compare data on the language learning behaviors and outcomes of beginner Chinese speakers and beginner Spanish speakers. This could include data on their language proficiency levels, learning strategies, and sources of motivation.
4. Use machine learning algorithms: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of language learning data, including learner-generated data from online language learning platforms. By analyzing patterns in the data, you can identify trends and issues that may not be immediately apparent through manual analysis.
5. Conduct corpus linguistics analysis: Use corpus linguistics techniques to analyze large datasets of text in both Chinese and Spanish, focusing on the frequency and distribution of certain words, phrases, or grammatical structures. This can help identify common issues faced by beginner learners in both languages.
6. Create a language learning app: Develop a language learning app that tracks learner progress and provides feedback on areas where they need improvement. By analyzing the data collected from the app, you can identify common issues faced by beginner learners and tailor the app's content and features accordingly.
7. Conduct neuroimaging studies: Use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG) to study the neural mechanisms involved in language learning, particularly in beginner learners of Chinese and Spanish. This can help identify specific brain regions and processes that are involved in language acquisition and may be affected by individual differences or learning difficulties.
8. Examine language teaching methods: Analyze language teaching methods used for both Chinese and Spanish to
