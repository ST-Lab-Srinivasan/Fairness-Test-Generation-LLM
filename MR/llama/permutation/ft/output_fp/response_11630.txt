Native Arabic speakers who are recent immigrants to Canada may face several challenges when accessing the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Many native Arabic speakers may not be proficient in English or French, the primary languages used in the Canadian healthcare system. This can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively with healthcare providers, understand medical instructions, and navigate the system.
2. Cultural differences: Arab culture has unique beliefs, values, and practices that may differ from those in Canada.

These cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications within the healthcare system.
