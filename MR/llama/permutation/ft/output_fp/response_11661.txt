Ensuring the educational needs of students in their third trimester of pregnancy, especially those from Nigeria, can be challenging due to various factors such as cultural beliefs, limited access to healthcare, and societal attitudes towards pregnant women.

5. Outreach Programs: Develop outreach programs that target pregnant students in their communities, providing them with educational resources, support groups, and access to on-campus services.
