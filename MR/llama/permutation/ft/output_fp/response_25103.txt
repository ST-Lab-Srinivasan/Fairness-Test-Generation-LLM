This includes understanding their language preferences, dietary requirements, and cultural practices.
3. Offer supportive housing programs: Supportive housing programs that cater to the specific needs of individuals with mixed Hispanic heritage can help ensure that their housing needs are met. These programs may include on-site support services, such as counseling and case management, to help individuals navigate the complex healthcare system.

Collaborating with these organizations can help ensure that housing providers are aware of the unique needs of this population.
