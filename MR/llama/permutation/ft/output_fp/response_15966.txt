To ensure that the educational needs of native Spanish speakers who are not long-time married students are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Provide bilingual education: Offer courses or programs that provide instruction in both English and Spanish to meet the needs of native Spanish speakers. This can help them develop their language skills and feel more comfortable in the educational setting.
2. Offer cultural events and activities: Organize events and activities that celebrate Latin American culture, such as festivals, concerts, or art exhibitions. This can help students connect with their heritage and feel more engaged in the educational process.
3. Provide support services: Offer counseling, tutoring, or other support services specifically designed for native Spanish speakers who may be facing challenges in the educational setting. This can help them build confidence and succeed academically.
4. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Pair native Spanish speakers with English-speaking students to facilitate language exchange and cultural understanding. This can help foster a sense of community and belonging among all students.
5. Incorporate technology: Utilize digital resources, such as online courses or educational apps, to provide native Spanish speakers with additional learning opportunities outside of the classroom. This can help them stay engaged and motivated throughout the year.
6. Foster a positive school environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere in schools, where all students feel valued and supported. This can involve promoting cultural events, encouraging student participation, and providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives.
7. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with community-based organizations that cater to the needs of native Spanish speakers, such as language schools or cultural centers. This can help provide additional resources and support to these students outside of the traditional classroom setting.
8. Offer flexible scheduling options: Accommodate the diverse needs of native Spanish speakers by offering flexible scheduling options, such as part-time enrollment or online courses. This can help them balance their academic commitments with other responsibilities, such as work or family obligations.
9. Provide language immersion programs: Offer language immersion programs that allow students to learn in a setting where Spanish is the primary language spoken.
