Creating educational programs that are inclusive of the perspectives of individuals who are over 90 years old, regardless of their citizenship status, requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Center the voices of older adults: Involve older adults in the design and delivery of educational programs by listening to their experiences, sharing their knowledge, and valuing their contributions. Encourage intergenerational dialogue and collaboration to create content that is relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Ensure that all educational programs are designed with inclusivity in mind, considering the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of older adults. Provide accommodations and modifications as needed to make the learning environment accessible and comfortable for everyone.
3. Adapt teaching methods: Consider the cognitive and physical abilities of older adults when designing educational programs. Use teaching methods that are engaging, interactive, and easy to follow, such as storytelling, discussion groups, and hands-on activities.
4. Address social isolation: Older adults who are non-citizens may experience social isolation due to language barriers or cultural differences. Create opportunities for social interaction and community building within educational programs to combat this issue.
5. Provide supportive learning environments: Offer flexible scheduling, one-on-one support, and additional resources to help older adults who may need extra time or assistance to complete coursework. Ensure that the learning environment is free from distractions and promotes focused attention.
6. Promote intergenerational connections: Encourage connections between older adults and younger generations through shared activities, mentorship opportunities, and community events. This can help bridge cultural divides and promote mutual understanding.
7. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent older adults from accessing educational programs or participating fully in the learning process. For example, provide translation services, modify assessment methods for individuals with limited literacy skills, or offer financial assistance to cover program fees.
8. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an inclusive environment where older adults feel valued and respected. Encourage open communication, empathy, and understanding among participants of all ages and
