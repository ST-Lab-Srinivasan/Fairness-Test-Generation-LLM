Addressing the specific needs of recently divorced, multiple times native Chinese speakers in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique circumstances and challenges. Here are some strategies that educators can implement to support these individuals:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Recognize that cultural norms and values surrounding divorce vary across different cultures and communities. Be sensitive to the potential emotional and psychological impact of divorce on these individuals, especially if they come from collectivist cultures where the emphasis is on family and social cohesion.
2. Language support: Provide language support for those who may need it, especially if their native language is Chinese. Offer language classes or hire interpreters to facilitate communication between teachers, students, and parents.
3. Flexibility in scheduling: Accommodate the unique needs of recently divorced individuals by offering flexible scheduling options, such as online courses or part-time programs. This can help them manage their time more effectively while balancing work, family, and personal responsibilities.
4. Individualized support: Offer individualized support to help these students navigate the educational system. This may include academic advising, career counseling, and mental health services to address any emotional or psychological challenges they may be facing.
5. Campus resources: Provide access to campus resources such as counseling services, student clubs and organizations, and recreational facilities. Encourage these students to get involved in extracurricular activities that promote social interaction and personal growth.
6. Community outreach: Reach out to the local Chinese-speaking community to raise awareness about the needs of recently divorced individuals. Collaborate with local organizations to provide support services, such as language classes or cultural events, that can help these students feel more connected to their community.
7. Education and advocacy: Educate teachers, staff, and students about the unique challenges faced by recently divorced individuals. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and support for these students.
8. Peer mentoring: Pair recently divorced students with more experienced peers who can provide emotional support and guidance throughout their academic journey.
