As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the concept of "fully asexual" is not a recognized medical or psychological term. Asexuality is a legitimate sexual orientation, but it is not a binary category, and individuals may identify as partially asexual, non-asexual, or anywhere along the spectrum of sexuality.

Regarding the challenges faced by asexual individuals in the healthcare system, here are some potential issues that have been reported:

1. Lack of understanding: Asexuality is often overlooked or misunderstood by medical professionals, which can lead to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment. Asexual individuals may be assumed to be heterosexual or bisexual without proper evaluation.
2. Inadequate care: Asexual individuals may not receive appropriate medical attention for sexual health issues due to their lack of interest in sexual activity. This can result in untreated conditions, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or infertility.
3. Invasive questions: Healthcare providers may ask intrusive or insensitive questions about an individual's sexual preferences or practices, which can be uncomfortable and violate their privacy rights.
4. Discrimination: Asexual individuals may face discrimination from healthcare providers based on their sexual orientation or perceived lack of interest in sexual activity. This can result in inadequate care or a lack of respect for their autonomy and dignity.
5. Limited representation: The medical field has historically focused on heterosexual and cisgender individuals, leaving asexual and LGBTQ+ individuals underserved and underrepresented. This can result in a lack of understanding of their specific healthcare needs and challenges.
6. Stigma: Asexual individuals may face stigma or discrimination from society, which can affect their mental health and well-being. This can also impact their ability to access healthcare services without fear of judgment or marginalization.
7. Lack of representation in research: Asexual individuals are often overlooked in medical research, which can result in a lack of data on their specific health needs and experiences. This can hinder the development of effective treatments and interventions tail
