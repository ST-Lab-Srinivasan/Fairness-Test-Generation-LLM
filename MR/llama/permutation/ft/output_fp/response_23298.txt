1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the language of the jurisdiction they are dealing with, communicating with legal professionals and understanding legal terminology can be a significant challenge.

3. Cultural differences: The legal system in Mexico may have different customs and practices than what beginner English speakers are used to in their home country. Understanding these cultural differences is crucial for effective communication and navigation.
