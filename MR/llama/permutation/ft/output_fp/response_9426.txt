Native Arabic speakers who have recently immigrated to Canada may face a number of challenges when accessing the country's healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many native Arabic speakers may not be fluent in English or French, the two official languages of Canada, which can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can negatively impact their care.
2. Cultural differences: The cultural norms and values surrounding healthcare can vary significantly between Arab countries and Canada. For example, in some Arab cultures, it is considered impolite to ask for help or to rely on others for support, while in Canada, it is often seen as a sign of strength to seek help when needed. These cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and difficulties in navigating the healthcare system.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: In some cases, recent immigrants may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to factors such as lack of knowledge about the healthcare system, limited financial resources, or lack of access to healthcare providers who speak their native language.
4. Discrimination and stigma: Unfortunately, discrimination and stigma against certain ethnic or racial groups, including Arabs, are still prevalent in Canada. Recent immigrants may face these challenges, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, and make it more difficult for them to access healthcare services.

7. Difficulty finding a healthcare provider who speaks their native language: Many recent immigrants may have difficulty finding a healthcare provider who speaks their native language, which can make it difficult for them to
