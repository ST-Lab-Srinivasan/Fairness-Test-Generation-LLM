Ensuring that the educational needs of non-upper-class non-conservative individuals are met requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the systemic barriers and biases that exist in the education system. Here are some strategies that can help:

Governments and educational institutions can work together to provide affordable and accessible education to all, regardless of socio-economic status.
2. Promote diversity and inclusion: Educational institutions must actively work towards promoting diversity and inclusion in their curriculum, pedagogy, and student body. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives, histories, and cultures into the curriculum and creating safe and inclusive learning environments.
