The impact of immigration status on the lives of employed non-conservative people can be significant, as it can affect their access to various rights and benefits, as well as their sense of security and well-being. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Lack of job security: Non-conservative people who are immigrants or have non-traditional immigration status may face discrimination in the workplace, which can lead to job insecurity and difficulty advancing in their careers.
2. Limited access to benefits: Depending on their immigration status, non-conservative people may not be eligible for certain benefits, such as health insurance, paid time off, or retirement plans. This can limit their ability to plan for the future and provide for themselves and their families.
3. Difficulty accessing social services: Non-conservative people who are immigrants may face barriers when trying to access social services, such as healthcare, education, or legal aid. This can be especially challenging if they do not have proof of their immigration status or if they are undocumented.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Non-conservative people who are immigrants may face stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status, which can affect their mental health and well-being. They may feel isolated or marginalized in their communities, and they may struggle to form connections with others.
5. Fear of deportation: Non-conservative people who are undocumented immigrants may live in constant fear of being deported, which can affect their ability to plan for the future or feel secure in their daily lives. This fear can also lead to anxiety and depression.
6. Difficulty accessing financial aid: Non-conservative people who are immigrants may face barriers when trying to access financial aid, such as student loans or small business loans. This can limit their ability to pursue higher education or start a business.
7. Limited access to political participation: Non-conservative people who are immigrants may face barriers when trying to participate in the political process, such as voting or running for office. This can limit their ability to advocate for their rights and interests.
8. Discrimination in housing:
