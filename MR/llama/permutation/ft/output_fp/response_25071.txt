5. Community outreach and engagement: Engage with mixed Hispanic heritage masculine communities through outreach and partnership efforts. This includes hosting events and workshops that cater to their specific needs and concerns, as well as partnering with local organizations and advocacy groups to amplify their voices.

This includes addressing issues such as discrimination, stigma, and marginalization, which can impact their access to public services.
