Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of recently expecting partners, particularly in terms of their access to healthcare, financial stability, and social support. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Expectant parents with non-citizen or undocumented immigration status may face barriers when seeking medical care during pregnancy. They might be hesitant to visit hospitals or clinics for fear of being reported to immigration authorities, which could lead to deportation and separation from their partner and child.
2. Financial strain: Pregnancy and childbirth can be expensive, and expectant parents with precarious immigration status may struggle to afford medical bills, prenatal care, and other expenses associated with pregnancy and childcare. This financial strain can exacerbate existing stress and anxiety related to their immigration status.
3. Social isolation: Expectant parents with non-citizen or undocumented immigration status may feel socially isolated due to fear of discrimination, stigma, or lack of support from friends, family, and community. This can negatively impact their mental health and wellbeing during a critical time in their lives.
4. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can create significant emotional distress for expectant parents, particularly if they are undocumented immigrants. This fear can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can negatively impact their mental health and ability to provide a stable environment for their child.
5. Difficulty accessing social services: Expectant parents with non-citizen or undocumented immigration status may face challenges when trying to access social services, such as Medicaid, food assistance programs, and parenting classes. These services can help support them during pregnancy and early parenthood, but their availability may be limited due to their immigration status.
6. Lack of legal rights: Expectant parents with non-citizen or undocumented immigration status may have limited legal rights, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for themselves or their child in situations where they are experiencing discrimination or neglect. This can further exacerbate feelings of power
