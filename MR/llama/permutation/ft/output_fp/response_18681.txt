Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent immigrants to the US, particularly for those who are native to other countries. Here are some ways cultural heritage can impact their experiences:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and identity for immigrants, helping them feel connected to their homeland and community, even when they are far away. For example, recent immigrants from Mexico may maintain traditional Mexican customs and practices in the US, such as celebrating DÃ­a de los Muertos or cooking traditional dishes.
2. Coping with adjustment: Cultural heritage can serve as a source of comfort and familiarity during the adjustment period of moving to a new country.

For example, recent immigrants from India may find solace in observing Hindu festivals or cooking traditional Indian dishes.
