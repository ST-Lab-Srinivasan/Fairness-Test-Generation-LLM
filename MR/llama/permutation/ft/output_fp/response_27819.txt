Addressing the needs of non-disabled mixed African-American individuals in disaster response is crucial to ensure that everyone in the community receives appropriate support and accommodations. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Inclusive Disaster Planning: Develop inclusive disaster plans that take into account the diverse needs of all community members, including those with disabilities. This involves consulting with organizations that represent people with disabilities and ensuring that their voices are heard in the planning process.
2. Accessible Communication: Ensure that communication during a disaster is accessible to everyone, including individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, by using American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters, captioned telephones, and other communication supports.
3. Disability-Aware Emergency Response Teams: Train emergency responders to be aware of the needs of people with disabilities and how to provide appropriate support during a disaster. This can involve training on how to assist individuals with mobility impairments, how to evacuate individuals with accessibility needs, and how to communicate effectively with individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
4. Accessible Shelters: Ensure that shelters are accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities. This can involve providing wheelchair-accessible facilities, adaptive equipment, and additional supports such as sign language interpreters and audio describers.
5. Partnership with Disability Organizations: Collaborate with organizations that represent people with disabilities to ensure that their needs are met during a disaster response. This can involve working together to develop inclusive disaster plans, providing accessible communication supports, and advocating for the rights of individuals with disabilities.
6. Inclusive Disaster Recovery: Ensure that the recovery process is inclusive of all community members, including those with disabilities. This can involve providing accessible housing options, adaptive equipment, and additional supports such as home modification services and transportation assistance.
7. Awareness Raising: Raise awareness among the general public and emergency responders about the needs of individuals with disabilities during a disaster response. This can involve conducting outreach and education campaigns, developing inclusive disaster preparedness materials, and providing training on how to support individuals with disabilities during a disaster.
