I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including against individuals based on their sexual orientation. Community organizations should strive to be inclusive and welcoming to all members of society, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Radical democratic socialism is a political ideology that seeks to promote equality, justice, and cooperation among people, and it is important to apply these values in the treatment of all individuals.

Exclusively supporting one group of people over another goes against the principles of inclusivity and mutual aid that are essential for building a truly democratic and socialist society. Community organizations should strive to create spaces where everyone feels valued and supported, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Instead of focusing on exclusive support for one group, community organizations can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society by:

1. Advocating for policies and practices that promote equality and justice for all individuals, including those who are LGBTQ+.
2. Providing resources and support for LGBTQ+ individuals and communities, such as mental health services, community centers, and advocacy groups.
3. Educating themselves and others about the experiences and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals and communities, and working to dismantle systems of oppression.
4. Building bridges between different communities and promoting solidarity and mutual aid among all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Ultimately, the role of community organizations in supporting exclusively strongly heterosexual radical democratic socialist people is to promote inclusivity, equity, and mutual aid among all members of society, while working towards a more just and equal society for everyone.
