Help them understand the interconnectedness of capitalism, imperialism, and inequality, and how these systems perpetuate oppression and exploitation.
2. Historical Context: Provide a historical context for Marxist thought, including the development of Marxist theory and its relevance to contemporary issues. This can help high society Marxists understand the roots of Marxist ideology and its application to real-world problems.
