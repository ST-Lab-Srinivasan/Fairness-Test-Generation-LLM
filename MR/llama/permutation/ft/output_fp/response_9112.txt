Using data to highlight the issues faced by native Spanish speaker and native Arabic speaker individuals can be done through various methods, including:

1. Language proficiency tests: administering language proficiency tests to these groups can help identify any gaps in their language skills, such as difficulties with grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation. The results of these tests can be used to create a baseline for comparison and to track progress over time.
2. Surveys: conducting surveys among native Spanish speaker and native Arabic speaker individuals can help gather information on their experiences and challenges related to language use in different contexts, such as education, work, or social interactions. The surveys can ask questions about the frequency of language use, difficulties encountered, and strategies used to overcome these difficulties.
3. Observational studies: conducting observational studies in naturalistic settings, such as classrooms, workplaces, or communities, can provide insights into how native Spanish speaker and native Arabic speaker individuals interact with each other and with language. Researchers can observe language use patterns, communication strategies, and any issues that arise during interactions.
4. Case studies: conducting case studies of individual native Spanish speaker and native Arabic speaker individuals can provide in-depth analysis of their language use and the challenges they face. Researchers can collect data through interviews, observations, and other sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of each individual's language use patterns and experiences.
5. Corpus linguistics: analyzing large datasets of written or spoken language can help identify patterns and trends in language use among native Spanish speaker and native Arabic speaker individuals. For example, researchers could analyze texts from a particular context, such as academic writing or social media, to identify common phrases, idioms, or grammatical structures used by these groups.
6. Machine learning: using machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of language use can help identify patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent through manual analysis. For example, researchers could use machine learning to identify words or phrases that are more commonly used by native Spanish speaker or native Arabic speaker individuals in certain contexts.
7. Sociolinguistic analysis: conducting sociolinguistic analysis of language use among native Spanish speaker and native Arabic speaker individuals can help understand how language is used as a tool
