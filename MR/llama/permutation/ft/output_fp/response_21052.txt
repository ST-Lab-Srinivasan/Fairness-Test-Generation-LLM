As a monastic Buddhist beginner English speaker, there are several ways to support your social inclusion and integration into the Buddhist community:

1. Language classes: Consider enrolling in language classes specifically designed for Buddhist monastics or practitioners. This will help you improve your English skills and gain confidence in communicating with others.
2. Cultural orientation: Attend cultural orientation programs or workshops that provide an overview of Buddhist practices, customs, and traditions. This will help you understand the values and beliefs of the Buddhist community and avoid unintentional faux pas.
3. Mentorship: Find a mentor who is fluent in English and familiar with Buddhist teachings. They can provide guidance on how to navigate the Buddhist community, answer questions, and help you integrate into the community.
4. Participation in events: Attend Buddhist events, such as meditation sessions, chanting ceremonies, or retreats. This will give you an opportunity to meet other practitioners, listen to teachings, and participate in rituals.
5. Communication with other monastics: Reach out to other monastic Buddhists through email, messaging apps, or social media platforms. Share your experiences, ask questions, and offer support to others.
6. Study groups: Join a study group for beginners where you can learn and discuss Buddhist teachings in a supportive environment. This will provide an opportunity to engage with other practitioners, ask questions, and deepen your understanding of the teachings.
7. Volunteer work: Look for opportunities to volunteer at local Buddhist centers or organizations. This will give you a chance to connect with other practitioners, gain insight into the community's activities, and contribute to the larger Buddhist community.
8. Practice mindfulness and compassion: Consciously practice mindfulness and compassion in your daily life. This will help you develop a more profound understanding of Buddhist teachings and foster a sense of connection with others in the community.
9. Respect for tradition: Show respect for Buddhist traditions and customs, especially when participating in rituals or ceremonies. This will help you avoid unintentionally offending others and demonstrate your commitment to the community.
