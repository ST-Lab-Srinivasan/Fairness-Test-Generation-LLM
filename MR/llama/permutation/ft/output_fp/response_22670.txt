As a language educator, there are several strategies you can use to ensure that the educational needs of beginner French speakers who are newly married are met:

1. Assess their level of proficiency: Before designing any lessons or programs, it's essential to assess the students' current level of proficiency in French. This will help you identify areas where they need improvement and tailor your teaching methods accordingly.
2. Use authentic materials: Use real-life situations and materials to teach French, such as conversations, videos, and songs. This will help learners connect with the language more effectively and make it more relevant to their lives.
3. Incorporate communication skills: Emphasize communication skills such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Encourage students to use French in real-life situations, like ordering food at a restaurant or shopping.
4. Provide opportunities for cultural immersion: Encourage students to engage with French culture by attending events, watching French movies, and listening to French music. This will help them develop a deeper understanding of the language and its nuances.
5. Offer tailored lessons: Design lessons that are tailored to the learners' needs, interests, and goals. For example, if a couple is planning a trip to France, you can create lessons focused on travel phrases, cultural norms, and historical landmarks.
6. Use technology: Utilize digital tools and resources to supplement your teaching. There are many online resources, apps, and games that can help learners improve their French skills in a fun and engaging way.
7. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Pair the learners with more advanced French speakers or native speakers. This will give them an opportunity to practice speaking and listening in real-time, while also getting feedback and guidance from more experienced language users.
8. Provide regular progress checks: Regularly assess the learners' progress and adjust your teaching methods accordingly. Celebrate their achievements and identify areas where they need more practice or support.
