Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-binary identifying individuals, including those who are wealthy and multimillionaires, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all genders, such as "non-binary" or "genderqueer." Avoid using binary terms like "he" or "she," which can be alienating for individuals who don't identify with these categories.
2. Representation matters: Ensure that the celebration includes representation of non-binary individuals in leadership roles, performances, and other aspects of the event. This can help create a sense of belonging and validation for non-binary attendees.
3. Gender-neutral spaces: Create gender-neutral spaces where non-binary individuals feel comfortable and included. For example, use gender-neutral language in decorations, signs, and other visual elements.

6. Respectful costuming: Encourage attendees to dress in a way that is comfortable and respectful of their gender identity. Avoid requiring attendees to wear specific clothing or accessories that may be alienating or uncomfortable for non-binary individuals.
