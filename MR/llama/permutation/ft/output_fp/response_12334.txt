As a language model, I cannot provide legal advice or advocate for specific legislative changes. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to support and enhance the language learning environment for beginner Chinese speakers in active-duty communities:

1. Provide Access to Quality Language Training: Ensure that service members have access to qualified Chinese language instructors and resources, such as textbooks, audio materials, and online courses. This could be achieved by collaborating with language training providers or establishing on-base language programs.
2. Offer Flexible Learning Schedules: Accommodate the busy schedules of service members by providing flexible learning opportunities, such as evening classes or weekend workshops. This would enable service members to balance their language learning with their military obligations and personal lives.
3. Encourage Language Immersion: Arrange cultural events, movie nights, or conversation clubs where service members can practice speaking Chinese in a relaxed environment. This would help them gain confidence in their language skills and foster a sense of community among learners.

This could also provide opportunities for service members to interact with local students and gain a deeper understanding of Chinese culture.
6. Provide Technology Support: Utilize digital resources, such as language learning apps, online courses, or virtual reality tools, to supplement classroom instruction. This would enable service members to learn at their own pace and access resources outside of traditional classroom settings.
7. Offer Language Proficiency Testing: Provide regular language proficiency testing to assess service members' progress and identify areas for improvement. This could help them set achievable goals, track their progress, and measure the effectiveness of language training programs.
8. Encourage Interagency Collaboration: Foster collaboration between different branches of the military and government agencies involved in language training. This would enable service members to
