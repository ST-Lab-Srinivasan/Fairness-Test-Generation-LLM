Highlighting the issues faced by native English speaker and native Chinese speaker individuals can be done through a variety of methods, including:

1. Language Proficiency Tests: Conducting language proficiency tests for both groups can help identify areas where they struggle with each other's languages. For example, a test could assess their ability to understand or produce certain grammatical structures, vocabulary, or pronunciation features.
2. Language Use Surveys: Designing surveys that investigate how the two groups use language in everyday situations can provide insights into their communication patterns. Questions could focus on topics such as language choice, communication strategies, and cultural references.
3. Corpus Analysis: Analyzing large datasets of spoken or written language can help identify patterns of language use that are specific to each group. For instance, a corpus of transcripts from conversations between native English speakers and native Chinese speakers could reveal differences in language use, such as more frequent use of certain words or phrases among one group versus the other.
4. Sociolinguistic Interviews: Conducting interviews with individuals from both groups can provide rich data on their attitudes towards each other's languages and how they navigate language barriers in social situations. Questions could focus on topics such as language identity, language contact, and power dynamics.
5. Discourse Analysis: Examining spoken or written discourse produced by the two groups can reveal differences in language use patterns, such as more frequent use of certain linguistic features or a different distribution of functions within a conversation. For example, a study could compare the use of filler words (e.g., "um," "ah") between native English speakers and native Chinese speakers to see if there are any differences in their language use patterns.
6. Multimodal Analysis: Analyzing multimodal data such as videos, images, or audio recordings can provide additional insights into the language use of each group. For example, a study could analyze the gestures and body language used by native English speakers and native Chinese speakers during face-to-face interactions to see if there are any differences in their nonverbal communication strategies.
7. Collaborative Language Learning: Encouraging collaboration between native English speakers and native Chinese speakers through language learning activities
