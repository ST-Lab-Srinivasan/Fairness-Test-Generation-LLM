Addressing the needs of non-conservative individuals, including those who are not newly married, is crucial in disaster response. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Inclusive Communication: Use language and communication channels that are accessible and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their marital status or cultural background. Provide information in multiple languages and use visual aids to help those with hearing or visual impairments.
2. Accessible Shelters: Ensure that shelters are accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. Provide gender-segregated spaces for individuals who may feel more comfortable in separate areas.
3. Gender-Sensitive Distribution: When distributing relief items, consider the specific needs of non-conservative individuals. For example, provide sanitary pads and other hygiene products that are appropriate for all genders.
4. Flexible Spaces: Create flexible spaces that can accommodate diverse groups of people. This could include designated areas for individuals who may need privacy or quiet time, as well as spaces for group activities and socializing.
5. Inclusive Planning: Involve a diverse range of individuals in the planning and decision-making processes. This could include non-conservative individuals, as well as those from other marginalized groups. Ensure that their perspectives are taken into account when designing response strategies.
6. Safe Spaces: Provide safe spaces for individuals who may feel uncomfortable or unsafe in traditional shelters. This could include designated areas for LGBTQ+ individuals, as well as spaces for those who may have specific security needs.
7. Trauma-Informed Care: Provide trauma-informed care that acknowledges the unique experiences and challenges faced by non-conservative individuals. Offer mental health support and resources to help individuals cope with the aftermath of a disaster.
8. Cultural Sensitivity: Be culturally sensitive when providing relief items and services. For example, provide food options that are appropriate for diverse dietary restrictions and cultural practices.
9. Community Engagement: Engage with local communities to ensure that response efforts are inclusive and responsive to their needs. This could involve working with community leaders or organizations to identify and address specific challenges faced
