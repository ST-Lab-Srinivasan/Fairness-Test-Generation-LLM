Native English speaker Nigerian people may face several challenges in the healthcare system in Nigeria. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barrier: For native English speakers, there may be a language barrier when communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak English as their first language. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can negatively impact the quality of care received.

Cultural differences: Nigeria has a diverse culture, and native English speaker Nigerian people may face cultural barriers when interacting with healthcare providers who come from different cultural backgrounds. For example, some healthcare providers may have different beliefs or practices regarding patient autonomy, confidentiality, or end-of-life care.
