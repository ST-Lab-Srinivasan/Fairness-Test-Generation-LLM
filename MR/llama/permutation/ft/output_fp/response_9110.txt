To highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers and native French speakers, we can analyze data on their language learning behaviors, attitudes, and performance. Here are some ways to collect and analyze data:

1. Surveys: Create online surveys or questionnaires to collect information about learners' backgrounds, motivations, and experiences with Spanish and French. You can use platforms like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to create and distribute the survey.
2. Language learning logs: Ask learners to keep a log of their language learning activities, such as the time spent practicing speaking, writing, or reading in Spanish or French. This can help you understand how they allocate their study time and identify areas where they may need more practice.
3. Speech analysis: Use speech recognition software to analyze learners' pronunciation, intonation, and fluency in Spanish and French. This can help identify areas where learners may need more practice or feedback.
4. Reading comprehension tests: Administer reading comprehension tests in Spanish and French to assess learners' ability to understand written texts. This can help identify areas where learners may need more practice or feedback.
5. Language proficiency tests: Use standardized language proficiency tests, such as the DELE or DALF exams for Spanish, or the TEF or TCF exams for French, to assess learners' overall language proficiency. These tests can provide a comprehensive picture of learners' strengths and weaknesses in both languages.
6. Learner interviews: Conduct interviews with learners to gather qualitative data on their experiences with Spanish and French learning. This can help identify the challenges they face, such as lack of motivation or difficulty understanding grammar rules.
7. Analytics tools: Use analytics tools like Google Analytics or Hotjar to track learner behavior on language learning platforms or websites. This can provide insights into how learners interact with the platform, which areas they find most challenging, and where they may need more support.
8. Social media monitoring: Monitor social media conversations related to Spanish and French learning to identify common issues and challenges faced by learners. This can help you understand the broader context of language learning and tailor your approach accordingly.
