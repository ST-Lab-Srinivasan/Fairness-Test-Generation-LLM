The immigration status of a person can have significant impacts on their life in Canada, regardless of whether they are a permanent resident or a natural-born Canadian citizen. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to benefits and services: Depending on their immigration status, some individuals may not be eligible for certain benefits and services, such as healthcare, education, or employment opportunities. For example, permanent residents may not have access to the same level of healthcare as Canadian citizens, and natural-born citizens may face barriers to accessing certain government programs and services.
2. Employment opportunities: An individual's immigration status can affect their ability to find and keep employment in Canada. For example, permanent residents may face limitations on the types of jobs they can hold or the industries they can work in, while natural-born citizens may have more job opportunities available to them.
3. Social isolation: Individuals who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents may experience social isolation, particularly if they do not speak French or English fluently. This can make it difficult for them to connect with their communities and access support services.
4. Housing and homelessness: An individual's immigration status can affect their ability to access affordable housing or avoid homelessness. For example, some provinces have laws that restrict the ability of non-citizens to access government-subsidized housing.
5. Health outcomes: Research has shown that individuals with lower immigration status are more likely to experience poor health outcomes, including higher rates of chronic diseases, mental health issues, and premature mortality.
6. Education: An individual's immigration status can affect their access to education in Canada. For example, permanent residents may face barriers to accessing certain programs or courses, while natural-born citizens may have more educational opportunities available to them.
7. Political participation: Individuals who are not Canadian citizens may face barriers to participating in the political process, such as voting or running for public office.
8. Criminal justice system: An individual's immigration status can affect their interaction with the criminal justice system in Canada. For example, permanent residents may be subject to deportation after serving a sentence, while natural-born citizens may have more protections under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Fre
