Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for young adult native English speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and representative of diverse cultures:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the planning committee reflects the diversity of the community. This can be achieved by having a diverse team of organizers, including individuals from different racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.
2. Involve marginalized communities: Reach out to marginalized communities and involve them in the planning process. Give them a platform to share their culture and traditions, and ensure that their voices are heard.
