Creating more inclusive cultural events for newly married civilian individuals involves understanding their needs, preferences, and values. Here are some steps you can take to make your events more welcoming and enjoyable for all attendees:

1. Understand the audience: Get to know your guests by conducting a survey or interviewing them directly. Find out what they like, what they find enjoyable, and what they would appreciate. This will help you tailor your event to their needs.
2. Incorporate diverse elements: Include music, dance, food, and other cultural elements from different backgrounds to cater to the diverse tastes of your guests. For example, if you have a mix of Indian and American guests, include both traditional Indian and American music and dances in your event.
3. Provide interpretation and translation services: If some of your guests may not speak the same language as the majority of the attendees, provide interpretation or translation services to ensure everyone can participate and enjoy the event.
4. Offer accessible accommodations: Make sure your event venue is wheelchair-accessible and has amenities such as gender-neutral restrooms for guests who may need them.
5. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group of people. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all attendees.
6. Involve the community: Encourage members from different communities to participate in your event by providing opportunities for them to perform, speak, or contribute in some other way. This will help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where everyone feels valued and included. Encourage guests to share their experiences and traditions with the group, and provide opportunities for them to connect with each other.
8. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be aware of cultural practices or elements that may be sensitive or sacred to certain groups, and avoid using them in your event without proper understanding or permission.
9. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local community centers, cultural organizations, or religious institutions to co-host your event. This will not only help you reach a broader audience but also show your commitment to inclusivity and diversity.
