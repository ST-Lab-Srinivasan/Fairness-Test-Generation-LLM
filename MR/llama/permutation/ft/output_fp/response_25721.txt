Genetic conditions can have significant impacts on the lives of young adults in their 20s, particularly those who are average income earners. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Limited employment opportunities: Many genetic conditions may affect a person's ability to work or perform certain tasks, limiting their job prospects and earning potential. This can be especially challenging for young adults who are just starting their careers.
2. Financial strain: The costs of managing a genetic condition, including medical expenses, prescription medications, and lifestyle modifications, can put a significant strain on a person's finances. This can be particularly challenging for young adults who are living on a tight budget.
3. Social isolation: Young adults with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to the stigma associated with their condition or the limitations it imposes on their daily lives. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.
4. Limited independence: Some genetic conditions may limit a person's independence, particularly if they require constant supervision or assistance with daily tasks. This can be frustrating for young adults who value their independence.
5. Emotional challenges: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, particularly during the transition to adulthood. Young adults may struggle with feelings of anxiety, fear, and insecurity as they navigate their new responsibilities and roles.
6. Impact on relationships: Genetic conditions can affect not only the individual but also their loved ones. Young adults may experience strained relationships with family members or friends who do not understand their condition or are unable to provide adequate support.
7. Limited access to healthcare: Depending on the location and availability of healthcare resources, young adults with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing quality medical care. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, which can exacerbate the condition's symptoms.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a significant amount of stigma and discrimination surrounding genetic conditions. Young adults may face social rejection or discrimination due to their condition, leading to feelings of low self-esteem and self-worth.
