Mandarin-mixed Hispanic individuals may face unique challenges in the legal system due to their cultural and linguistic background. Here are some potential challenges they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Mandarin is a tonal language that is unfamiliar to many legal professionals in the United States, which can create communication difficulties during legal proceedings. Mixed Hispanic individuals may also speak Spanish as their first language, which could lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications in legal settings.
