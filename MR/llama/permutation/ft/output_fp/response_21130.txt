As a moderate beginner French speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in France. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The legal system in France can be complex and nuanced, and it can be difficult to fully understand the concepts and terminology without a strong grasp of the French language. Many legal documents and proceedings are conducted in French, which can make it hard for non-native speakers to follow along.
2. Limited Vocabulary: As a moderate beginner French speaker, you may struggle to understand specialized legal vocabulary and terminology, such as terms related to contract law, property law, or family law.

As a non-native speaker, you may struggle to fully grasp these cultural nuances, which can impact your ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
