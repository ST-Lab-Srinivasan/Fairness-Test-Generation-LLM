Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for left-leaning formerly newly married individuals involves recognizing and respecting their unique experiences, values, and beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Be mindful of language and terminology: Avoid using language that assumes a traditional or heteronormative understanding of marriage. Instead, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities and marital statuses. For example, instead of saying "newlyweds," you could say "individuals who have recently married" or "couples."
2. Include a diverse range of voices: Ensure that the cultural celebrations include a diverse range of voices and perspectives. This can be achieved by involving individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities in the planning and execution of the celebrations.
3. Foster an inclusive atmosphere: Create an atmosphere that is welcoming and inclusive to all individuals, regardless of their gender identity, marital status, or political beliefs. This can be achieved by promoting respectful dialogue, encouraging open communication, and creating a sense of belonging for everyone involved.

5. Offer accommodations for diverse needs: Be prepared to accommodate the diverse needs of participants, including individuals with disabilities, by providing necessary accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.

8. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and resources that are inclusive and respectful of all gender identities, marital statuses, and political beliefs. This
