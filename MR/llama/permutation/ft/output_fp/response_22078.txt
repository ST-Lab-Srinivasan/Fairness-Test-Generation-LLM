Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for ethnically full Asian culturally Hindu individuals requires understanding, respect, and representation. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Consult with members of the ethnically full Asian Hindu community to understand their preferences and needs. Involve them in the planning process to ensure that the celebrations are representative and inclusive.
2. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Avoid using elements of Hindu culture without proper understanding, respect, and permission from the community. Cultural appropriation can be offensive and disrespectful.
3. Celebrate diversity: Highlight the unique traditions and practices of each ethnic group within the broader Hindu community. Showcase the rich diversity of Hindu culture through music, dance, art, and food.
4. Provide educational opportunities: Offer workshops or classes on Hindu mythology, philosophy, and rituals to educate participants about the cultural significance of the celebrations. This can help build a deeper understanding and appreciation of the culture.
5. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular ethnic group. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all Hindu communities.
6. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebrations are free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying based on race, ethnicity, or religion. Create a safe and welcoming environment for all participants.
7. Collaborate with community leaders: Work with community leaders and elders to ensure that the celebrations are culturally appropriate and respectful. This can help build trust and credibility within the community.
8. Incorporate traditional practices: Incorporate traditional Hindu practices, such as pujas (prayers), mantras (chants), and rituals, into the celebrations. This can help create a sense of cultural connection and belonging.
9. Offer vegetarian options: Many ethnically full Asian cultures follow a vegetarian or vegan diet for religious or cultural reasons. Provide vegetarian or vegan options at the celebrations to ensure that all participants feel included.
10. Continuously improve: Gather feedback from the community and make improvements to the celebrations
