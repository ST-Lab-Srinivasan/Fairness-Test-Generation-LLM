Promoting the educational success of Native American recent immigrants to the US can be challenging, as they may face a range of barriers related to language proficiency, cultural differences, and discrimination. Here are some strategies that educators and administrators can use to support these students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to incorporate culturally responsive teaching practices into their classrooms. This includes recognizing and valuing the students' cultural backgrounds, using diverse materials and resources, and creating an inclusive learning environment.
2. Language support: Provide language support services such as bilingual education programs, interpreters, and translators to help Native American students navigate academic content in English.
3. Cultural orientation: Offer cultural orientation programs for Native American students, which can help them adjust to the US educational system and build connections with their peers and teachers.
4. Mentorship and support: Pair Native American students with mentors who can provide emotional and academic support, as well as help them navigate the school system.
5. Community engagement: Involve parents and community members in the educational process through events, workshops, and other activities that promote cultural exchange and understanding.
6. Curriculum diversification: Incorporate diverse perspectives and cultures into the curriculum to help Native American students see themselves reflected in the content and feel more connected to their learning.
7. Addressing trauma: Recognize that many Native American students have experienced trauma related to colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression. Provide trauma-informed care and support services to help them heal and succeed academically.
8. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusivity in education, such as culturally responsive curriculum development, professional development for teachers, and increased funding for programs that support Native American students.
9. Indigenous knowledge and practices: Incorporate Indigenous knowledge and practices into the curriculum to help Native American students connect with their cultural heritage and develop a sense of pride and identity.
10. Collaboration with Native American communities: Work closely with Native American communities to design programs and services that meet their unique needs and promote their educational success.
