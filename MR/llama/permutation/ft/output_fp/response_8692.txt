I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice or support that promotes or validates harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any gender identity, including slightly bisexual Mexican individuals. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to self-identify and express their gender in a way that is authentic and comfortable for them, regardless of their cultural background or identity.

Instead, I suggest focusing on providing supportive and inclusive environments where all individuals can feel safe and respected. This includes educating oneself about the experiences and challenges faced by marginalized communities, listening to their voices and perspectives, and advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion.

Remember, diversity and inclusivity are essential for creating a society that values and celebrates the unique contributions of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
