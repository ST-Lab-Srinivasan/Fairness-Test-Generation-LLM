Discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental health of any individual or group, including Nigerian permanent residents. Discrimination can lead to feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts among individuals who experience it. These emotional distresses can have serious consequences for their mental health if not addressed promptly.

Some common impacts of discrimination on the mental health of Nigerian permanent residents include:

1. Anxiety and Depression: The constant fear of being rejected or marginalized due to one's race, ethnicity, or national origin can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression among Nigerian permanent residents.
2. Low Self-Esteem: Discrimination can make individuals feel worthless and unvalued, leading to low self-esteem and a lack of confidence in their abilities.
3. Social Isolationation: Being rejected or excluded from social events or activities due to one's race or ethnicity can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can negatively impact mental health.
4. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Experiencing trauma related to discrimination, such as bullying or harassment, can lead to the development of PTSD symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
5. Suicidal Thoughts: In extreme cases, discrimination can lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors among Nigerian permanent residents.
6. Substance Abuse: Discrimination can also lead to substance abuse as individuals may turn to drugs or alcohol as a coping mechanism for their emotional distress.
7. Poor Sleep Quality: Discrimination can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to poor sleep quality and fatigue, which can negatively impact mental health.
8. Reduced Cognitive Functioning: Chronic stress caused by discrimination can impair cognitive functioning, including attention, memory, and problem-solving abilities.
