Ensuring that the financial needs of non-disabled and bisexual people are met is essential for promoting equity and inclusion in society. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Acknowledge and address systemic barriers: Disability and bisexuality can intersect with other social and economic factors, such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. To address these intersections, it's crucial to acknowledge and address the systemic barriers that non-disabled and bisexual people face. This includes working to dismantle ableism and biphobia in society and institutions.
2. Implement inclusive policies and practices: Organizations and institutions should implement policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion for non-disabled and bisexual people. This can include providing accommodations and support, such as accessible facilities, flexible work arrangements, and mental health resources.
3. Provide education and training: Educating staff and the broader community about disability and biphobia can help to promote understanding and inclusivity. Training can cover topics such as the social model of disability, intersectionality, and the importance of inclusive language and practices.
4. Engage with disabled and bisexual communities: It's essential to engage with disabled and bisexual communities and involve them in decision-making processes that affect their lives. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that they have a voice in shaping policies and practices.
5. Address economic inequality: Disability and biphobia can contribute to economic inequality for non-disabled and bisexual people. Addressing this inequality through policies such as progressive taxation, social safety nets, and affordable housing can help ensure that everyone has access to financial resources and support.
6. Support inclusive economic development: Encouraging economic development that is inclusive of non-disabled and bisexual people can help to promote equity and inclusion. This can involve supporting small businesses and social enterprises owned by disabled and bisexual individuals, as well as investing in infrastructure and services that benefit the broader community.
7. Advocate for policy change: Advocating for policy changes at the local, national, and international levels can help to promote equity and inclusion for non-disabled
