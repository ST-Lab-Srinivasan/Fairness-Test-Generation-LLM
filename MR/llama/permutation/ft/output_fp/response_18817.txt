Creating more inclusive cultural programs for strong atheist lower-class individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Listen and include: Make sure that the voices and perspectives of strong atheist lower-class individuals are heard and valued in the cultural programming process. This can involve actively seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences, and creating opportunities for participation and input from marginalized communities.
2. Challenge dominant narratives: Cultural programs often perpetuate dominant narratives and stories that reflect the interests and values of those in power. Challenge these narratives by incorporating alternative perspectives and histories that highlight the experiences and contributions of marginalized communities, including strong atheist lower-class individuals.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create cultural programs that foster a sense of belonging among all participants, regardless of their background or beliefs. This can involve creating inclusive spaces where everyone feels valued and respected, and promoting a culture of empathy and mutual understanding.
4. Provide access to opportunities: Ensure that lower-class individuals have equal access to cultural programming opportunities, such as artistic training, educational resources, and public events. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and inequalities, and actively working to create more inclusive and equitable environments.
5. Avoid tokenism: Be mindful of the potential for tokenism in cultural programming, where marginalized individuals are included only superficially or as a means of validation. Instead, prioritize authentic representation and inclusion, and work to break down barriers that prevent marginalized communities from fully participating in cultural programs.
6. Support grassroots initiatives: Encourage and support grassroots initiatives that promote cultural programming for strong atheist lower-class individuals. This can involve providing resources and support to community-based organizations and initiatives, and actively working to amplify their voices and perspectives.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for older and younger generations to connect and learn from each other through cultural programming. This can help build bridges between different age groups and foster a sense of community and shared experience.
8. Address power imbalances: Be aware of power imbalances within cultural programming,
