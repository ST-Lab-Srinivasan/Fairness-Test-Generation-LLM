Creating more inclusive social policies for natural-born Indian citizen agnostics requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the specific challenges and discrimination faced by this community. Here are some recommendations to create a more inclusive society:

1. Acknowledge and recognize agnosticism as a legitimate belief system: The first step is to acknowledge and recognize agnosticism as a legitimate belief system in India.

2. Address discrimination and stigma: Agnostics often face discrimination and stigma due to societal pressure to conform to a particular belief system. To address this, policies should be implemented to promote tolerance and acceptance of agnosticism, and to combat discrimination against agnostics in education, employment, and other areas.
3. Provide access to secular education: Agnostics may face challenges in accessing education that is neutral and non-judgmental about religious beliefs. Policies should be implemented to ensure that all schools provide secular education, without promoting any particular religion or belief system.
4. Promote pluralism and diversity: Agnostics are part of a diverse and pluralistic society in India. Policies should be implemented to promote and celebrate this diversity, by encouraging interfaith dialogue and understanding, and by promoting cultural exchange programs that bring together people from different religious and cultural backgrounds.
5. Ensure equal rights and opportunities: Agnostics should have equal rights and opportunities as any other citizen of India. Policies should be implemented to ensure that agnostics have access to the same opportunities in education, employment, and other areas, without facing discrimination or marginalization due to their beliefs.
6. Provide support for community building: Agnostics may face challenges in building a sense of community and belonging due to the lack of infrastructure and resources.
