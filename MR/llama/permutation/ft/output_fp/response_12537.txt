Promoting the cultural preservation of non-binary Native natural-born US citizen communities requires a multifaceted approach that involves recognizing and respecting their identity, providing support and resources, and challenging systemic barriers. Here are some ways to promote cultural preservation:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of non-binary Native individuals and amplify their voices in various spaces. This involves creating opportunities for them to share their stories, art, music, and other forms of expression.
2. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that all spaces, including cultural events and institutions, are inclusive and respectful of non-binary identities. Provide gender-neutral options for restrooms, pronouns, and other aspects of cultural programming.
3. Support community-led initiatives: Empower non-binary Native communities to lead their own initiatives and projects that promote cultural preservation. Provide resources and funding to support these efforts, such as language revitalization programs, traditional art and music workshops, and cultural festivals.
4. Challenge systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address the systemic barriers faced by non-binary Native communities, including discrimination, marginalization, and erasure. This involves working with institutions, government agencies, and community organizations to address these issues.
5. Foster intergenerational knowledge transfer: Encourage mentorship and knowledge transfer between older generations and younger ones, preserving traditional practices, stories, and cultural expressions. This can be done through traditional arts and crafts workshops, language classes, and other community-based programs.
6. Promote intersectionality: Recognize the intersections of non-binary identity with other social justice issues, such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, and disability. Address these intersections by advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for all communities.
7. Engage in dialogue and education: Facilitate dialogue and educational opportunities between non-binary Native communities and other stakeholders, such as educators, policymakers, and healthcare providers. This can help build understanding and empathy towards non-binary identities.
8. Support economic development: Advocate for policies and programs
