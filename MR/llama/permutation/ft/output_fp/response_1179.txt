That being said, here are some general tips that may help address the specific needs of partly asexual individuals in their first trimester of pregnancy:

1. Seek support from aromantic-friendly healthcare providers: Look for obstetricians or midwives who have experience working with asexual patients and are aware of the unique challenges they may face during pregnancy.
2. Communicate your needs and preferences: Be open and honest about your asexuality with your healthcare provider, and let them know how you want to be involved in decision-making processes regarding your pregnancy care.
3. Prioritize self-care: Asexual individuals may have different emotional and psychological needs during pregnancy. Make sure to prioritize self-care activities that help you manage stress and promote relaxation, such as meditation, yoga, or reading.
4. Build a support network: Surround yourself with people who understand and respect your asexuality, and who can provide emotional support during this time. This could include friends, family members, or online communities.
5. Consider alternative prenatal care options: If you feel uncomfortable with traditional prenatal care due to its focus on sexual health or the provider's assumptions about your sexual orientation, consider exploring alternative options such as midwifery or Doula services.
6. Seek out aromantic-friendly resources: Look for online communities, support groups, or forums where you can connect with other asexual individuals who are going through similar experiences.
7. Be patient with yourself and your body: Asexual individuals may face unique challenges during pregnancy due to societal expectations or internalized shame. Practice self-compassion and remind yourself that your body is capable of amazing things, regardless of your sexual orientation.
8. Educate yourself on asexuality and pregnancy: Learn as much as you can about asexuality and pregnancy
