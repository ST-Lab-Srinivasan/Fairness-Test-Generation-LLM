I must emphasize that creating inclusive public spaces requires a thoughtful and respectful approach towards accommodating the needs of diverse individuals, including those who identify as extreme ultra-liberal native Arabic speakers. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive public spaces for this group:

1. Language Support: Provide translation services or interpretation support in both spoken and written forms to ensure that all individuals can fully participate in public events, meetings, and discussions, regardless of their language proficiency.
2. Accessibility Features: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, Braille signage, and assistive listening devices. This will help create an inclusive environment for all individuals, including those who may have mobility or sensory impairments.
3. Inclusive Design: Design public spaces with inclusivity in mind. For example, consider using visual aids, such as images or diagrams, to convey information and ideas instead of relying solely on text. This can help individuals with cognitive or learning disabilities participate more fully in public events and discussions.
4. Flexible Spaces: Create flexible spaces that can accommodate different types of activities and events. For example, provide multi-purpose rooms that can be configured to meet the needs of diverse groups, such as quiet workspaces for individuals who prefer to work independently or collaborative workspaces for group projects.
5. Inclusive Programming: Develop programming that caters to a wide range of interests and needs. For example, offer events focused on topics relevant to extreme ultra-liberal native Arabic speakers, such as social justice, cultural exchange, or artistic expression. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity for this group within the broader public space.
6. Safe Spaces: Establish safe spaces where individuals can express themselves freely without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be especially important for extreme ultra-liberal native Arabic speakers who may face marginalization or oppression in other areas of society.
7. Intersectional Approach: Adopt an intersectional approach when designing public spaces to address the multiple identities and experiences of individuals within the extreme ultra-liberal native Arabic
