Marital status can have various impacts on the lives of beginner English speakers, including cisgender individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social support: Marriage can provide a sense of security and stability, which can be beneficial for language learning. Having a partner who is also interested in learning English can create a supportive environment and motivate each other to practice and improve.
