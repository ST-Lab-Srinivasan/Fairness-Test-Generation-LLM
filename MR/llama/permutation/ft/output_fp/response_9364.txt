Ensuring that the healthcare needs of all citizens, including those who are born in India and are below the poverty line, is a critical challenge for the government. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Universal Health Coverage (UHC): Implementing UHC can help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare regardless of their economic status. Under UHC, the government would provide financial support to hospitals and healthcare providers to ensure that they can offer affordable care to all patients.
2. Affordable Health Insurance: Providing affordable health insurance options for low-income families can help them access quality healthcare without breaking the bank. The government could partner with private insurance companies to offer subsidized policies or launch its own insurance program.
3. Public Health Facilities: Strengthening public health facilities, particularly in rural areas, can help provide accessible and affordable healthcare to low-income families. These facilities should be well-equipped with qualified staff and modern medical technology.
4. Community Health Workers (CHWs): Training and deploying CHWs in rural areas can help bridge the gap between urban and rural healthcare. CHWs can provide basic healthcare services, such as vaccinations, disease diagnosis, and referral services, to people living in remote areas.
5. Telemedicine: Leveraging telemedicine technologies can enable low-income patients to access specialist care remotely, reducing the need for costly hospitalizations or travel to urban areas. The government could invest in telemedicine infrastructure and provide subsidies for low-income patients to use these services.
6. Health Education: Implementing targeted health education programs can help low-income families adopt healthy behaviors, such as proper nutrition, exercise, and hygiene practices. This can help prevent chronic diseases and reduce healthcare costs in the long run.
7. Poverty Reduction Initiatives: Addressing poverty through other government programs can help reduce the financial burden on low-income families, making healthcare more accessible. For example, initiatives to create jobs, improve education, and enhance living standards can help lift people out of poverty and improve their overall wellbeing.
