Creating more inclusive social policies for physically disabled Marxist individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various barriers and challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of people with disabilities, avoiding terms that perpetuate stereotypes or stigmatize them. For example, use "person with a disability" instead of "disabled person."
2. Accessible infrastructure: Ensure that public spaces and buildings are accessible to people with disabilities by providing things like wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
3. Education and awareness: Provide education and training to the general population on how to interact with and support people with disabilities. This can include learning about the different types of disabilities, their experiences, and how to break down barriers.
4. Employment opportunities: Create job opportunities for people with disabilities in all sectors, including in the public sector. Provide accommodations such as flexible work schedules, assistive technology, and job coaching.
5. Healthcare access: Ensure that people with disabilities have access to quality healthcare services, including preventive care, rehabilitation, and mental health support.
6. Political representation: Ensure that people with disabilities are represented in decision-making processes at all levels of government. This can be achieved by appointing disabled individuals to public offices or through the use of proportional representation systems.
7. Social security and benefits: Provide social security and benefit programs that are inclusive of people with disabilities, ensuring they have access to financial support and resources.
8. Transportation: Ensure that transportation services are accessible to people with disabilities, including public transportation such as buses and trains, as well as private vehicles.
9. Housing: Provide affordable and accessible housing options for people with disabilities, including adaptive technologies and assistive devices.
10. Community involvement: Encourage community involvement and social participation among people with disabilities by providing opportunities for them to participate in recreational activities, cultural events, and volunteer work.
11. Intersectionality: Acknowledge that people with disabilities are not a homogeneous group and recognize the intersectionality of their experiences
