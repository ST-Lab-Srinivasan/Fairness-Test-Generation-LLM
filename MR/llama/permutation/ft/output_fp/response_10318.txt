A national average earner person, who represents the middle class or median income earner in a country, can bring several unique perspectives to the table when it comes to discussions on economic policies and issues. Here are some of these perspectives:

1. Practicality: National average earners are more likely to be grounded in reality and practicality than those who are wealthy or living below the poverty line. They have to manage their finances and make ends meet, which gives them a unique understanding of the economic challenges faced by ordinary people.
2. Balanced perspective: As they are neither extremely rich nor extremely poor, national average earners have a balanced perspective on economic issues. They are less likely to be influenced by extreme views or biases, and more likely to see things from a nuanced and fair standpoint.
3. Emphasis on middle-class values: National average earners tend to prioritize middle-class values such as hard work, fairness, and social mobility. They are more likely to be concerned with issues that affect the majority of people, such as affordable housing, quality education, and job opportunities.
4. Resistance to inequality: As they are not part of the wealthy elite, national average earners may be more resistant to policies that perpetuate economic inequality. They may be more likely to advocate for policies that promote fairness and equality in the distribution of wealth and resources.
5. Focus on long-term sustainability: National average earners often have a long-term view of economic issues, as they are concerned with maintaining their standard of living and ensuring the sustainability of their financial situation over time. They may be more likely to prioritize policies that promote long-term economic stability and growth.
6. Influence on political decision-making: As national average earners make up a significant portion of the population in many countries, their perspectives and concerns can have a significant impact on political decision-making. They may be more likely to vote for politicians who prioritize their economic needs and concerns.
7. Diverse experiences: National average earners come from diverse backgrounds and experiences, which can provide a unique perspective on economic issues. For example, they may have different views on the impact of globalization, immigration, or technological change on the economy
