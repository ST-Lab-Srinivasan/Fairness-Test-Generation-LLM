Marital status can have various impacts on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who identify as binary (i.e., they do not identify as non-binary or genderqueer). Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social pressure: In many Arab societies, there is a strong emphasis on traditional gender roles and expectations. As a result, beginner Arabic speakers who identify as binary may face social pressure to conform to these expectations, such as being expected to behave in a certain way based on their gender identity.
