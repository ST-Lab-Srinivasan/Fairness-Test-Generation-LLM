As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must first emphasize that every individual has the right to learn and speak any language they choose, regardless of their background or identity. However, I understand your question and will provide some suggestions on how to advocate for the rights of beginner French speakers who are not lifelong single individuals:

1. Create a supportive community: Beginner French speakers may feel isolated or intimidated when learning a new language. Encourage them to join a language exchange group, either online or in-person, where they can practice speaking with other learners and get feedback from more experienced speakers.
2. Provide resources and tools: Offer beginner French speakers access to language learning resources such as textbooks, audio materials, and language learning apps. You could also provide them with grammar guides, vocabulary lists, and cultural insights to help them improve their language skills.
3. Address cultural barriers: As a non-native speaker, beginner French speakers may face cultural barriers that hinder their ability to learn the language. Encourage them to explore French culture and history, watch French movies or TV shows with subtitles, listen to French music, and read French literature.
4. Promote inclusive learning environments: Ensure that beginner French speakers feel welcome and included in language learning environments. Encourage teachers and fellow learners to be patient and respectful of beginners' struggles, and provide opportunities for them to practice speaking and listening in a supportive atmosphere.
5. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diverse backgrounds and identities of beginner French speakers, and recognize that language learning is a valuable opportunity for cultural exchange. Encourage learners to share their experiences and perspectives, and foster an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
6. Advocate for language education: Support organizations that promote language education and advocate for greater access to language learning resources. Encourage policymakers to prioritize language education in schools and communities, and work towards creating a more linguistically diverse and inclusive society.
7. Provide mentorship: Offer beginner French speakers the opportunity to connect with more experienced learners or native speakers who can provide guidance and support throughout their language learning journey.
