Ensuring the healthcare needs of middle-class income Mexican people requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including access, affordability, quality of care, and social determinants of health. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Universal Health Coverage (UHC): Implementing UHC can help ensure that middle-class income Mexicans have access to essential healthcare services without financial hardship. UHC could be achieved by adopting a single-payer system, where the government is responsible for financing and managing the healthcare system.
2. Affordable Healthcare Prices: Implementing cost-containment measures can help make healthcare more affordable for middle-class income Mexicans. This could involve negotiating lower drug prices, implementing fee caps for healthcare providers, and encouraging competition among insurance providers.
3. Quality of Care: Investing in primary care and preventive services can help improve the quality of care for middle-class income Mexicans. This could involve increasing funding for community health centers, promoting the use of evidence-based practices, and implementing quality improvement programs.
4. Health Workforce Development: Developing the healthworkforce through training and education programs can help improve the quality of care for middle-class income Mexicans. This could involve investing in nursing and medical school scholarships, providing ongoing professional development opportunities, and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.
5. Addressing Social Determinants of Health: Many health outcomes are influenced by social determinants such as poverty, education, and living conditions. Addressing these factors can help improve the overall health of middle-class income Mexicans. This could involve investing in housing programs, promoting educational attainment, and implementing policies to reduce poverty and inequality.
6. Public Health Surveillance: Monitoring public health trends and outbreaks can help identify health needs and priorities for middle-class income Mexicans. This could involve investing in surveillance systems, conducting regular health assessments, and implementing targeted interventions to address identified health disparities.
7. Community Engagement: Encouraging community engagement and participation in healthcare decision-making can help ensure that the needs of middle-class income Mexicans are met.
