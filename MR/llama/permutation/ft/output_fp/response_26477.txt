The impact of immigration status on the lives of natural-born citizens and recent immigrants to India can be significant, affecting various aspects of their lives such as social, economic, and political well-being. Here are some potential impacts:

1.

2. Social Stigma: Immigration status can lead to social stigma and discrimination, which can affect the mental health and well-being of both natural-born citizens and recent immigrants. For example, recent immigrants may face prejudice and racism, leading to feelings of isolation and exclusion.
3. Employment Opportunities: The immigration status of a person can impact their ability to find employment, as some jobs may be restricted or unavailable to certain groups. Natural-born citizens may have an advantage in terms of job opportunities due to their citizenship, while recent immigrants may face more challenges in finding work.

For example, natural-born citizens may have easier access to homeownership and property rights, while recent immigrants may face more obstacles in securing housing.
5. Political Involvement: The immigration status of a person can impact their ability to participate in political processes, such as voting or running for public office. Natural-born citizens may have greater political power and representation than recent immigrants due to their citizenship.
