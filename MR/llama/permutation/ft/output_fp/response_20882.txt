I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American Nigerians. However, I must point out that the term "ethnically full" is problematic and can be perceived as perpetuating harmful ideas of racial purity. It's important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot be reduced to simple categorizations.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the initiatives themselves, rather than the racial or ethnic background of the individuals leading them. There are many successful community initiatives led by African-American Nigerians that have positively impacted their communities and society at large. Some examples include:

1. The Nigerian Diaspora Development Commission (NDDC) - This organization was established in 2018 to harness the skills, expertise, and resources of Nigerians living abroad for the development of Nigeria's economy and society.
2. The African-American Historical Society - This organization aims to promote the history and culture of African Americans, including their experiences and contributions to American society.
3. The Black Women's Empowerment Network (BWEN) - BWEN is dedicated to promoting the economic, social, and political empowerment of black women in the United States and around the world.
4. The National African-American Museum - This museum is dedicated to the preservation and celebration of African American history and culture, including the experiences of African Americans in the United States and abroad.
5. The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation - This organization works to end systemic racism and police brutality against black people around the world through advocacy, education, and community organizing.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American Nigerians. I hope this information is helpful in addressing your query.
