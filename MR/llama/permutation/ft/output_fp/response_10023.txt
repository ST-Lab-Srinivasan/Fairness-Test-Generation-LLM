Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speaker Native American natural-born US citizens involves understanding the unique needs and experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the customs, traditions, and values of the Arabic-speaking community. This will help them create programs that are respectful and inclusive.
2. Community outreach and engagement: Engage with the Arabic-speaking community through outreach efforts, such as attending cultural events, partnering with local organizations, and using social media to reach a wider audience. This will help build trust and increase participation in programs.
3. Language classes tailored to needs: Offer Arabic language classes that are tailored to the needs of beginner learners. This could include classes specifically for Native American communities, as well as classes that focus on practical language skills, such as basic phrases and vocabulary related to everyday life.
4. Cultural immersion activities: Organize cultural immersion activities, such as cooking classes, traditional music and dance workshops, and language exchange programs. These activities can help learners develop a deeper understanding of Arabic culture and improve their language skills in a fun and interactive way.
5. Collaboration with local schools: Partner with local schools to offer Arabic language classes as part of their curriculum. This will provide opportunities for students to learn Arabic in a structured setting and may encourage more students to participate in cultural programs.
6. Accessibility and inclusivity: Ensure that all programs are accessible and inclusive for beginners of all ages and abilities. Provide accommodations, such as language interpretation or braille materials, to make the program more accessible to individuals with disabilities.
7. Focus on community building: Create programs that focus on building a sense of community among participants. This could involve organizing social events, such as potlucks or game nights, where learners can interact with each other and build relationships outside of class.
8. Collaboration with local organizations: Work with local organizations that serve the Arabic-speaking community to co-host programs and reach a wider audience. This could include partnering with mosques, cultural centers, or community associations.
