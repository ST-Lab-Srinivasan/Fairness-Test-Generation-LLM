Ensuring that the healthcare needs of undocumented immigrants, including those with known or suspected genetic conditions, is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Expand Medicaid coverage: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers in accessing healthcare due to their immigration status. Expanding Medicaid coverage to include these individuals could help bridge the gap in healthcare access.

3. Establish community health clinics: Setting up community health clinics in areas with high concentrations of undocumented immigrants can provide easy access to primary care and specialized services, including genetics. These clinics could be staffed by multilingual healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the needs of the immigrant population.
