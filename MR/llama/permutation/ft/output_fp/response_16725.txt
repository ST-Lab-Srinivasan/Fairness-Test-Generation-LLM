Creating more inclusive housing policies for late pregnancy (3rd trimester) long-time married individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that acknowledges the unique needs of this population. Here are some recommendations to create more inclusive housing policies:

1. Accommodate pregnancy and parenthood: Ensure that your housing policies explicitly accommodate pregnant women and new parents. Provide guidelines for requesting temporary modifications, such as a designated parking spot near the entrance or a flexible lease term to account for maternity leave.
2. Offer parental leave: Consider offering paid parental leave for new parents, regardless of gender or marital status. This can help reduce financial stress and allow new parents to focus on their health and well-being during this critical time.
3. Flexible work arrangements: Encourage employers in your community to offer flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or flexible hours, to accommodate the needs of new parents. This can help reduce the pressure to rush back to work too quickly and ensure a healthy transition into parenthood.
4. Access to healthcare: Ensure that your community has access to quality healthcare providers who specialize in prenatal and postnatal care. Provide resources for breastfeeding support and baby care, such as lactation rooms or baby-friendly spaces.
5. Support groups: Organize support groups or workshops for new parents, focusing on topics like baby care, breastfeeding, and mental health. This can help build a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation or anxiety during this time.
6. Affordable childcare: Offer affordable childcare options, such as drop-in centers or cooperatives, to support working parents who need reliable care for their children. Provide resources for finding quality childcare providers and offer subsidies or financial assistance for low-income families.
7. Accessibility and safety: Ensure that your housing policies prioritize accessibility and safety for new parents, particularly those with mobility issues or disabilities. Provide adaptive equipment, such as grab bars or wheelchair ramps, in common areas like bathrooms or elevators.
8. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in your market
