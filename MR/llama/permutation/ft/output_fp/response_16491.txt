Ensuring the educational needs of recently divorced, multiple times mentally disabled students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and support staff can use to provide appropriate support. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify the student's strengths and weaknesses: It is essential to understand the student's individual needs, including their cognitive abilities, communication styles, and learning preferences.
