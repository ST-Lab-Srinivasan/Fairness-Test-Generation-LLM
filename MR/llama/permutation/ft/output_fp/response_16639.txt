Creating more inclusive community events for native French speakers in their 90s or older can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this age group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer visual and auditory support: Many elderly individuals may have difficulty seeing or hearing, so it's essential to provide visual and auditory support during the event. This could include providing large print materials, using audio equipment to amplify sound, and designating areas for quiet conversation.
2. Simplify the format: Elderly individuals may find it challenging to participate in events with complex formats or long programs. Consider simplifying the format by breaking the event into shorter sessions, using a clear and straightforward agenda, and providing ample breaks for rest and socialization.
3. Provide comfortable seating and amenities: Make sure there is adequate seating and provide comfortable chairs with armrests to help individuals get in and out of them easily. Also, consider providing additional amenities such as blankets, pillows, and water bottles to make the event more enjoyable.
4. Offer a variety of activities: Older adults may have different interests and abilities, so it's important to offer a variety of activities that cater to these differences. For example, you could include chair yoga, art classes, or musical performances that are accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
5. Involve elderly individuals in the planning process: To ensure that the event is tailored to their needs and preferences, involve them in the planning process. Ask for their input on what they would like to see happen during the event and how it can be made more accessible and enjoyable for them.
6. Provide transportation and caregiver support: Many elderly individuals may need help getting to the event or require caregiver support during the event. Make sure to provide transportation options, such as shuttle buses or carpooling, and offer support for caregivers who are attending with their loved ones.
7. Offer interpretation and translation services: For individuals who are non-native French speakers or have difficulty understanding French, consider offering interpretation and translation services during the event. This can help ensure that everyone can fully participate and enjoy the event.
