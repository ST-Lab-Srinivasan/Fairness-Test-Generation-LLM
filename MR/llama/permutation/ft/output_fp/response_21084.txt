As a data analyst, you can use various statistical methods and data visualization tools to analyze and present data related to the challenges faced by beginner Spanish speaker native English speakers. Here are some ways to approach this task:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Create an online survey or conduct in-person interviews with beginner Spanish speakers to gather data on their experiences, challenges, and goals. You can ask questions related to their language learning journey, such as the difficulties they face when speaking Spanish, the most common mistakes they make, and their motivation for learning the language.
2. Analyze language learning data: Use existing datasets of language learning data, such as language learning apps or online courses, to analyze user behavior and identify patterns related to beginner Spanish speakers. For example, you could analyze how often beginners use certain grammar structures or vocabulary words, or how long it takes them to progress from one level to the next.
3. Use machine learning algorithms: Train machine learning models on datasets of language learning data to predict the challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers based on their language proficiency levels, learning styles, and other factors. You could use techniques such as regression analysis or clustering to identify patterns in the data and make predictions about future trends.
4. Visualize language learning progress: Use data visualization tools to create interactive dashboards or plots that show the progress of beginner Spanish speakers over time. This can help them identify areas where they need to improve and track their progress towards fluency.
5. Develop a sentiment analysis tool: Create a tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze online reviews, comments, and other text data related to beginner Spanish learners. This can help identify common challenges and sentiments expressed by learners, such as frustration with grammar rules or difficulty understanding native speakers.
6. Use social media analysis: Analyze social media data related to beginner Spanish learners, such as tweets, Facebook posts, or Instagram captions. This can help identify common challenges, interests, and motivations of learners, as well as trends in language learning content and resources.
7. Conduct a sentiment analysis of online language learning communities: Analyze the sentiment of online language learning communities, such as Reddit's language learning subreddits or language exchange websites. This
