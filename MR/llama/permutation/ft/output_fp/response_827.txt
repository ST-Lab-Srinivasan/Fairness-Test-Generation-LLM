Creating more inclusive social policies for divorced individuals who have been married multiple times and are permanent residents is essential to ensure that they have equal opportunities and rights as other members of society. Here are some ways to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Addressing discrimination based on marital status: Many social policies, such as those related to healthcare, education, and employment, may discriminate against individuals who have been married multiple times. Policies should be designed to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their marital status, have equal access to these services.
2. Providing financial support: Divorced individuals who have been married multiple times may face financial challenges, such as limited access to resources and benefits. Policies should provide financial support to help them overcome these challenges, such as through financial assistance programs or tax credits.
3. Encouraging access to education and job training: Divorced individuals who have been married multiple times may face barriers to accessing education and job training opportunities. Policies should encourage access to these opportunities by providing funding for scholarships, vocational training programs, or other forms of support.
4. Ensuring access to healthcare: Divorced individuals who have been married multiple times may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they do not have a spouse's insurance coverage. Policies should ensure that all individuals have access to affordable and comprehensive healthcare, regardless of their marital status.
5. Addressing housing discrimination: Divorced individuals who have been married multiple times may face discrimination when seeking housing, particularly if they do not have a spouse's income or credit history to secure a loan. Policies should address this issue by prohibiting discrimination based on marital status and ensuring that all individuals have access to affordable and safe housing.
6. Providing legal support: Divorced individuals who have been married multiple times may face legal challenges related to property division, spousal support, or child custody. Policies should provide legal support to help them navigate these issues and ensure that their rights are protected.
7. Encouraging social connections: Divorced individuals who have been married multiple times may face social isolation, particularly if they do not have a spouse or family members
