1. Uncertainty and fear: Employed non-conservative people with uncertain immigration status may live in constant fear of being deported or facing legal consequences. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
2. Limited job opportunities: Undocumented immigrants or those with temporary work visas may face limitations on the types of jobs they can hold, as well as their earning potential. They may also be at risk of being fired or having their hours reduced due to their immigration status.
3. Difficulty accessing healthcare: Non-conservative people with uncertain immigration status may struggle to access healthcare services, as they may be afraid to seek medical attention for fear of being reported to immigration authorities.
4. Social isolation: Employed non-conservative people with uncertain immigration status may feel isolated and disconnected from their communities, particularly if they are undocumented or have limited access to social services.
5. Difficulty accessing financial services: Non-conservative people with uncertain immigration status may face challenges when trying to open bank accounts, obtain loans, or access other financial services due to their immigration status.
6. Lack of access to education and training: Undocumented immigrants or those with temporary work visas may face barriers when seeking to access educational and training opportunities, which can limit their ability to advance in their careers or improve their job prospects.
7. Discrimination and stigma: Non-conservative people with uncertain immigration status may experience discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status, which can impact their mental health and well-being.
8. Family separation: Undocumented immigrants or those with temporary work visas may face challenges when trying to reunite with their families, particularly if they are the primary breadwinners for their households.
