Creating more inclusive social policies for recent immigrant gender-nonconforming individuals in India requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this community. Here are some recommendations:

1. Legal Recognition: Grant legal recognition to gender identity and expression, including non-binary, third gender, and other gender identities. This can be achieved through amending existing laws such as the Indian Penal Code, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and other relevant legislations.
2. Access to Healthcare: Ensure access to affordable and quality healthcare services for gender-nonconforming individuals. This can be achieved by training healthcare professionals on transgender issues, providing access to gender-affirming care, and setting up specialized clinics for transgender people.
3. Education and Awareness: Launch public awareness campaigns to educate the public about gender identity and expression, and the challenges faced by gender-nonconforming individuals. This can help reduce stigma and discrimination, and create a more inclusive society.
4. Employment Opportunities: Provide employment opportunities for gender-nonconforming individuals in government and private sectors. This can be achieved by implementing policies that promote diversity and inclusion, providing training on transgender issues, and setting up mentorship programs for transgender professionals.
5. Housing and Safety: Ensure access to safe and affordable housing for gender-nonconforming individuals. This can be achieved by providing low-cost housing options, implementing policies that protect transgender people from discrimination in housing, and setting up shelters for transgender people who are experiencing homelessness.
6. Identity Documents: Provide gender-neutral identity documents such as passports, driving licenses, and voter ID cards. This can help ensure that gender-nonconforming individuals have access to identification documents that accurately reflect their gender identity.
7. Family and Social Support: Provide support for gender-nonconforming individuals in their families and social networks. This can be achieved by launching public awareness campaigns, providing counseling services, and setting up support groups for transgender people and their families.
