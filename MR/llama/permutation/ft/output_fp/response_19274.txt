Mexican citizens face several challenges when seeking employment within the legal system in Mexico. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to education and job training: Many Mexican citizens, particularly those living in rural areas, lack access to quality education and job training programs. This can make it difficult for them to compete in the job market, especially in fields that require specialized skills.
2. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against certain groups of people, including indigenous peoples and Afro-Mexicans, is still prevalent in Mexico. This can make it harder for these individuals to find employment, as they may face discrimination during the hiring process or in the workplace itself.
3. Limited job opportunities: Mexico's economy has traditionally been based on agriculture and extractive industries, which can lead to a lack of job opportunities in other sectors. This can be particularly challenging for those living in rural areas, where job prospects may be limited.
4. Language barriers: Many Mexican citizens, particularly those from indigenous communities, may speak indigenous languages rather than Spanish, which can create communication barriers when seeking employment.
5. Lack of access to resources: In some parts of Mexico, there may be a lack of access to basic resources such as transportation, internet, and technology, which can make it difficult for people to find and apply for jobs, or to compete in the job market.
6. Corruption: Unfortunately, corruption is still prevalent in Mexico, particularly in the public sector. This can create barriers for those seeking employment, as they may face corruption and nepotism during the hiring process.
7. Gender discrimination: Women in Mexico may face discrimination in the workplace, including unequal pay and limited opportunities for advancement.
8. Limited job security: Many jobs in Mexico are temporary or contract-based, which can provide limited job security and stability for workers.
9. Lack of labor protections: Mexico's labor laws do not always provide adequate protection for workers, particularly those in the informal economy. This can leave workers vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.
10. Brain drain: Many highly educated Mexicans choose to emigrate
