Creating more inclusive social policies for employed, non-long-time married individuals requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges the diverse experiences and challenges faced by this demographic. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Recognize the changing nature of marriage and relationships: Marriage rates have declined in many countries, while the number of unmarried couples and those who identify as single or non-traditional has increased. Policies should reflect this shift and be inclusive of all relationship statuses.

This can manifest in various ways, such as reduced government benefits or higher taxes. Policies should aim to reduce or eliminate this penalty to promote workforce participation and economic growth.

Policies could provide financial planning resources and educational initiatives to help them better manage their money and plan for the future.
5. Provide affordable housing options: Housing affordability is a significant challenge for many employed individuals, particularly in urban areas. Policies should prioritize affordable housing options, such as rent control or subsidized housing programs, to help ensure that everyone has access to safe and affordable housing.
