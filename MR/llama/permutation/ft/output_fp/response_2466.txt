Recently, there has been an increasing trend towards ultra-conservatism in the healthcare system, particularly in the third trimester of pregnancy. This can pose several challenges for both the pregnant individuals and the healthcare providers. Some of the challenges faced by recently pregnant ultra-conservative people in the healthcare system include:

1. Limited access to care: Ultra-conservative individuals may have limited access to healthcare services due to their beliefs about modesty, gender roles, or cultural norms. This can lead to delayed or avoided prenatal care, which can result in poor pregnancy outcomes.
2. Resistance to medical advice: Ultra-conservative individuals may be resistant to medical advice or interventions that go against their beliefs. For example, they may refuse recommended prenatal tests or treatments, such as ultrasound or medication, due to religious or cultural objections.
3. Difficulty in communicating with healthcare providers: Ultra-conservative individuals may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers due to language or cultural barriers. This can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of medical advice, which can compromise the quality of care received.
4. Limited understanding of medical evidence: Ultra-conservative individuals may have a limited understanding of medical evidence and research, which can lead to a mistrust of medical advice and interventions. This can result in delayed or avoided medical care, which can compromise pregnancy outcomes.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Ultra-conservative individuals may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers due to their beliefs and practices. This can lead to feelings of isolation or marginalization, which can compromise the quality of care received.
6. Limited access to alternative care: In some cases, ultra-conservative individuals may have limited access to alternative forms of care, such as traditional or complementary therapies. This can result in delayed or avoided medical care, which can compromise pregnancy outcomes.
7. Difficulty in navigating the healthcare system: Ultra-conservative individuals may have difficulty navigating the healthcare system due to language or cultural barriers
