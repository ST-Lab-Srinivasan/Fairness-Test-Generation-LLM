I cannot make assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their identity or political beliefs. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including immigrants and natural-born citizens, but it is not the only factor that determines an individual's identity.

Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are transmitted from one generation to the next within a particular group or society. It encompasses the historical, social, and cultural context in which individuals grow up and develop their identities. For immigrants, their cultural heritage may include their country of origin, language, religion, customs, and traditions.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not the only factor that shapes an individual's identity. Personal experiences, social interactions, and political beliefs also play a significant role in shaping one's identity. For example, an immigrant may identify as both American and [their country of origin], and their cultural heritage may influence how they perceive themselves within the context of American society.

Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that cultural heritage is not a fixed or static concept. It can change and evolve over time as individuals interact with new cultures and experiences. For instance, an immigrant may adapt their cultural practices to fit into their new surroundings while still maintaining some aspects of their original culture.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizen non-socialist individuals. However, it is important to recognize that identity is complex and multi-faceted, influenced by a variety of factors beyond just cultural heritage.
