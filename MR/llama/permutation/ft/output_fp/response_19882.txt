I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about people's sexual orientations or gender identities based on their immigration status. Additionally, it is important to recognize that discrimination and unequal treatment of individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity is illegal in many countries and goes against basic principles of human rights and dignity.

It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, should be treated with respect and dignity, and should have equal access to opportunities and resources in the job market. Employers should not discriminate against temporary visa holders or any other group based on their immigration status, and should instead focus on evaluating candidates based on their qualifications, skills, and experience.

In short, it is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status or sexual orientation/gender identity.
