Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty native Chinese speaker people requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Provide translation support: Offer interpretation or translation services during the event, especially for important announcements or presentations. This will help ensure that all attendees can fully participate and understand the content.
2. Cater to cultural differences: Be mindful of cultural differences and customs when planning the event. For example, some Chinese cultures may find it impolite to speak loudly or interrupt others during a presentation. Make sure to provide enough space for attendees to comfortably participate and communicate with each other.
3. Incorporate Chinese culture: Incorporating elements of Chinese culture into the event can help create a more inclusive atmosphere. This could include traditional music, dance, or art exhibitions.
4. Offer language support: Provide language support during the event, such as translation headsets or mobile apps, to help attendees communicate with each other and with event staff.
5. Be sensitive to dietary restrictions: Many Chinese cultures have specific dietary restrictions, such as vegetarianism or avoiding certain foods. Make sure to provide a variety of options for attendees to choose from.
6. Provide accessible facilities: Ensure that the event venue is wheelchair-accessible and has adequate parking and transportation options for attendees with disabilities.
7. Engage with the community: Reach out to local Chinese communities and organizations to collaborate on the event. This can help build support and ensure that the event is tailored to the needs of active-duty native Chinese speaker people.
8. Offer childcare services: Active-duty military members often have limited childcare options while serving overseas. Consider providing childcare services during the event to make it more convenient for families to attend.
9. Involve attendees in planning: Encourage active-duty native Chinese speaker people to participate in planning and organizing the event. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account.
10. Follow up with attendees
