As a neutral AI language model, I must clarify that the term "devout Christian" can be perceived as marginalizing or stereotyping individuals based on their religious beliefs. It is important to recognize that Islam and Arabic are not exclusive to Muslims, and there are many Arabic speakers who identify as Christians, Jews, or adhere to other religions.

Regarding the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers in the legal system, it can vary depending on the country or region they are in. However, some common challenges that may be encountered include:

1. Language barrier: For individuals who are not fluent in Arabic, navigating the legal system can be difficult, especially when dealing with complex legal terminology and procedures.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in many Middle Eastern countries is shaped by Islamic law (Shariah), which may have different practices and expectations than what non-Muslims are used to in their own legal systems.
3. Lack of representation: Non-Muslims may face challenges in accessing legal resources and representation, particularly if they do not speak Arabic fluently or have limited knowledge of the local legal system.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-Muslims in some parts of the world may encounter discrimination or prejudice based on their religious beliefs, which can affect their access to justice and fair treatment under the law.
5. Limited availability of translated legal materials: In some countries, legal documents and resources may not be available in other languages, making it difficult for non-Arabic speakers to access information about their rights and responsibilities under the law.
6. Different legal frameworks: The legal systems in different Middle Eastern countries may have different structures, laws, and procedures, which can cause confusion for non-Muslims who are not familiar with them.
7. Lack of awareness of legal rights and protections: Non-Muslims may be unaware of their legal rights and protections under the law, particularly if they do not speak Arabic or have limited knowledge of the local legal system.
8. Limited access to legal aid: Non-Muslims may face challenges in accessing legal aid or social services, which can further exacerbate any difficulties they encounter in navigating the legal system
