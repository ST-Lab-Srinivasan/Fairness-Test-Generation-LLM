I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their immigration status or political beliefs. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or beliefs. It is important to recognize that poverty and ultra-conservatism are complex issues that can affect people from all walks of life, and it is not productive or fair to stereotype or make assumptions about individuals based on these factors.

Instead, it is important to approach each person with empathy and understanding, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all. This can involve advocating for policies and programs that address poverty and inequality, as well as promoting greater understanding and respect for the diversity of people's beliefs and experiences.

In short, it is not appropriate to make generalizations about any group of people based on their immigration status or political beliefs. Instead, we should strive to treat each person with dignity and respect, and work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all.
