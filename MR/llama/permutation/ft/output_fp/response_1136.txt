Supporting the economic empowerment of Native American natural-born US citizens who are long-term unemployed is crucial for their well-being and to address the socioeconomic disparities faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Job Training and Placement Programs: Provide job training and placement programs tailored to the needs of Native American communities. These programs could include vocational training, soft skills development, and mentorship opportunities to help individuals gain the skills and confidence needed to secure employment.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Encourage entrepreneurship by providing access to capital, business mentorship, and resources for starting and growing a business. This can help individuals create jobs for themselves and their communities, promoting economic self-sufficiency.
3. Apprenticeships and On-the-Job Training: Offer apprenticeships or on-the-job training opportunities in in-demand industries such as construction, manufacturing, or healthcare. This can provide individuals with hands-on experience and a pathway to employment.
4. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI): Establish CDFIs that provide affordable loans, financial services, and technical assistance to Native American communities. CDCs can help individuals start businesses, purchase homes, or finance education expenses.
5. Mentorship Programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair successful Native Americans with those who are unemployed or underemployed. This can provide valuable guidance and support to individuals looking to advance their careers.
6. Addressing Systemic Barriers: Advocate for policies that address systemic barriers to employment faced by Native Americans, such as discrimination, lack of access to education and training, and inadequate infrastructure. This can involve working with policymakers, advocacy groups, and community organizations.
7. Cultural Preservation and Revitalization: Support cultural preservation and revitalization efforts that promote the economic benefits of traditional practices and beliefs. This can help individuals maintain their cultural identity while also generating income through sustainable businesses or cultural tourism.
8. Partnerships with Local Businesses: Foster partnerships between Native American communities and local businesses to
