Protecting the legal rights of newly married reserve personnel is crucial to ensure their well-being and stability, especially during deployments. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Families must be informed about their partner's military service: Reserve forces often have limited knowledge of their spouse's deployment or training schedule.
