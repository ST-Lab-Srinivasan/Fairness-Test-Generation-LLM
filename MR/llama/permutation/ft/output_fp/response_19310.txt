Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers of mixed Asian heritage can be done by taking into account their diverse backgrounds and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs include a variety of voices and perspectives from different Asian cultures, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, etc. This can be done by including presenters or performers from these communities, or by showcasing their traditions and customs in the program.
2. Make it relatable: Connect the cultural programs to the lives of beginner Spanish speakers of mixed Asian heritage by highlighting common experiences, values, and beliefs. For example, you can explore how different Asian cultures celebrate important events or holidays, or how they honor their ancestors.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is insensitive or offensive to any particular group. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures. For example, instead of using the term "Asian," you can use "mixed Asian heritage" or "Asian American."
4. Provide cultural context: Give beginner Spanish speakers a deeper understanding of the cultural context of the programs they are participating in. This can include explaining the significance of certain customs, traditions, or practices, and how they relate to the broader Asian culture.
5. Encourage participation: Make sure that participants feel comfortable and included throughout the program. Encourage them to share their thoughts and experiences, and provide opportunities for them to actively participate in discussions or activities.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that have affected different Asian communities. Be sensitive to the ways in which these inequalities may impact the participants' experiences and perspectives, and work to create a safe and inclusive space for all.
7. Offer cultural workshops: Organize cultural workshops or classes that cater to the diverse backgrounds of beginner Spanish speakers. For example, you can offer a cooking class that teaches traditional Asian dishes, or a dance class that incorporates Asian styles and movements.
8. Create intercambio opportunities: Pair beginner Spanish speakers with native Spanish speakers
