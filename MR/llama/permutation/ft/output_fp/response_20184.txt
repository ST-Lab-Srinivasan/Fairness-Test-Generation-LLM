I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to promote or support any particular political ideology or party, including communism. It is important to respect the rights and beliefs of all individuals, regardless of their political affiliation.

In a democratic society, it is crucial to ensure that all citizens are able to exercise their right to vote and participate in the political process without fear of discrimination or persecution. This includes natural-born US citizen people who identify as communists, as well as those who hold other political beliefs.

To support the civic engagement of communist Native American citizens, it is important to:

1. Educate yourself on the issues affecting their communities and the political process in general. This can involve learning about local and national politics, as well as the history of civil rights and social justice movements.
2. Encourage civic engagement and participation in the political process. This can involve voting, running for office, volunteering for political campaigns or organizations, and attending public meetings and events.
3. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equality, including those that address systemic racism and discrimination faced by Native American communities.
4. Support organizations and initiatives that work to advance the rights and well-being of Native American citizens, such as tribal governments, community organizations, and advocacy groups.
5. Engage in respectful and constructive dialogue with individuals who hold different political beliefs, with a focus on listening, learning, and finding common ground.

Ultimately, it is important to approach political engagement and activism with a commitment to respect, empathy, and inclusivity, and to prioritize the well-being and empowerment of all individuals and communities.
