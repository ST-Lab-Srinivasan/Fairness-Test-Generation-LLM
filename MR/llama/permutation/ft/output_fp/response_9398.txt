Economic empowerment is a critical aspect of addressing the systemic inequalities faced by deeply lower-class ethnically full African Americans. Here are some strategies that can support their economic empowerment:

1. Education and Job Training: Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help individuals acquire skills and knowledge that can lead to better employment opportunities. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and college scholarships.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Encouraging entrepreneurship among deeply lower-class ethnically full African Americans can help create jobs and wealth within their communities. This can involve providing access to resources such as business loans, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Wealth Building Programs: Implementing programs that help individuals build wealth through homeownership, retirement savings, and other forms of investment can help reduce poverty and inequality. This can involve providing financial education, access to affordable housing, and incentives for saving and investing.
4. Community Development Initiatives: Investing in community development initiatives such as microfinance programs, cooperative businesses, and social enterprises can help create economic opportunities and improve living standards within low-income communities.
5. Advocacy and Policy Reform: Advocating for policy reforms that address systemic issues such as discrimination, unequal access to education and job opportunities, and inadequate social safety nets can help address the root causes of economic inequality. This can involve working with policymakers, community organizations, and advocacy groups to push for policy changes that benefit deeply lower-class ethnically full African Americans.
6. Addressing Systemic Inequality: Systemic inequality can perpetuate poverty and limit opportunities for economic advancement. Addressing issues such as discrimination, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to resources can help create a more equitable society where deeply lower-class ethnically full African Americans have better opportunities to thrive.
7. Health and Wellness Support: Providing access to health and wellness services can help improve the overall well-being of individuals and communities. This can involve investing in community health clinics, mental health services, and nutrition education programs.
