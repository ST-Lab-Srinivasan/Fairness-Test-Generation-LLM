Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty military personnel and their families requires careful consideration of their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to help make these events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Understand the challenges: Start by researching the experiences and challenges faced by active-duty military personnel and their families. This will help you identify the specific areas where your event can be made more inclusive.
2. Offer flexible scheduling: Military families often have non-traditional schedules due to deployments, training exercises, and other military obligations. Offer flexible scheduling options for your event to accommodate these schedules.
3. Provide childcare and family-friendly activities: Military families often struggle with finding quality childcare and activities that are suitable for their entire family. Consider providing on-site childcare or organizing activities that are family-friendly and inclusive.
4. Offer financial assistance: Many military families live below the poverty line due to the financial strain of military life. Consider offering financial assistance or discounts for your event to make it more accessible to these families.
5. Promote the event through military channels: Reach out to local military bases and installations to promote your event through their channels. This will help ensure that active-duty military personnel and their families are aware of the event and can attend.
6. Use inclusive language: Make sure to use language in your promotional materials that is inclusive of all branches of the military, as well as veterans and their families. Avoid using language that implies only one group is welcome.
7. Offer discounts or free admission: Consider offering discounts or free admission to active-duty military personnel, veterans, and their families. This can help make the event more accessible and welcoming to these groups.
8. Provide accessible venue: Make sure the venue is accessible for people with disabilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
9. Offer virtual participation options: For military personnel who are unable to attend in person, offer virtual participation options such as live streaming or online forums.
10. Follow up with attendees: After the event
