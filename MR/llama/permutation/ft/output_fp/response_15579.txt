1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: Beginner English speakers who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may face barriers when trying to enroll in schools or universities, or when looking for work. They may be at a disadvantage compared to native-born students or workers who have more favorable immigration statuses.

3. Limited access to social services: Beginner English speakers who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may struggle to access essential social services such as food assistance, housing support, and other forms of aid.
