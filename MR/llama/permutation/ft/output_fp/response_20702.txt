Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizen non-conservatives. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. For immigrants who come to the United States, their cultural heritage can influence how they navigate and interact with American society, and it can also impact their political views and identities.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizen non-conservatives:

1. Sense of belonging: Immigrants who come from diverse cultural backgrounds may feel a sense of belonging to multiple communities or cultures, which can influence their political beliefs and identity. For example, a person who identifies as both Latino and LGBTQ+ may feel a strong connection to both communities and may be more likely to advocate for policies that support marginalized groups.
2. Cultural values: Immigrants' cultural values and beliefs can shape their political views and identities. For example, someone who comes from a culture that places a high value on equality and social justice may be more likely to identify as a liberal or progressive. On the other hand, someone who comes from a culture that emphasizes individualism and personal responsibility may be more likely to identify as a conservative.
3. Language and communication: Language can play a significant role in shaping cultural identity and political views. For example, someone who speaks Spanish at home may feel more connected to the Latinx community and may be more likely to support policies that benefit this community. Similarly, someone who speaks English as a second language may have a different perspective on issues related to immigration and language access.
4. Cultural practices and traditions: Immigrants' cultural practices and traditions can influence their political views and identities. For example, someone who observes the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr may feel a strong connection to their Muslim identity and may be more likely to advocate for policies that support the Muslim community.
5. Intersectionality: Immigrants' cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of their identity, such as race, gender, or sexuality, to shape their political views and identities
