It is important to recognize that the term "ethnically full Hispanic" is problematic and can be perceived as perpetuating a binary view of race and ethnicity. Hispanic and Latino students are not a monolithic group, but rather a diverse population with a range of experiences, backgrounds, and identities.

Instead of focusing on the term "ethnically full Hispanic," it is important to address the systemic barriers and biases that can impact the educational success of all students, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Teachers can learn about the cultural backgrounds and experiences of their students and incorporate this knowledge into their teaching practices. This can involve using culturally relevant texts, images, and other materials in the classroom.
2. Bilingual education: Providing bilingual education programs can help Hispanic and Latino students who are English language learners to succeed academically. These programs can also help promote students' cultural identity and sense of belonging.
