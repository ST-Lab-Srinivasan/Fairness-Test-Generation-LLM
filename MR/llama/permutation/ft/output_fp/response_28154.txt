Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for older beginners (ages 90 and above) can be achieved by considering their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use simple language: Older adults may have difficulty understanding complex sentences or fast-paced conversations. Use clear, concise language that is easy to follow.
2. Provide visual aids: Many older adults may have difficulty processing auditory information. Use visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and videos to help them understand the cultural celebration.
3. Use familiar music: Older adults may enjoy music from their younger years. Incorporate familiar songs or rhythms into the cultural celebration to make it more relatable and enjoyable for them.
4. Focus on tactile experiences: Older adults may have difficulty seeing or hearing, but they may still be able to experience things through touch. Incorporate tactile elements such as textures, smells, and tastes into the cultural celebration.
5. Create a comfortable environment: Ensure that the space is comfortable and easy to navigate for older adults. Provide seating options, and make sure there are no obstacles or hazards that could cause them to trip or fall.
6. Offer choices: Allow older adults to participate in the cultural celebration at their own pace. Offer them choices such as attending a session or watching from a distance.
7. Provide transportation: If necessary, provide transportation to and from the cultural celebration to ensure that older adults can attend without any difficulties.
8. Have a support person present: Having a support person present, such as a family member or caregiver, can help older adults feel more comfortable and secure in their surroundings.
9. Incorporate reminiscence activities: Older adults may enjoy activities that stimulate their memory and cognitive abilities. Incorporate reminiscence activities such as showing old photographs or playing music from their youth into the cultural celebration.
10. Be patient and adaptable: Be prepared to make adjustments as needed to accommodate older adults' needs and preferences. Be patient and adaptable, and always prioritize their comfort and well-being.
