3. Advocacy: Family members can act as advocates for the individual, helping to navigate medical systems and secure necessary resources, such as healthcare services, accommodations at school or work, or financial assistance.
4. Social Connection: Family support can help individuals with unknown genetic conditions maintain social connections and build relationships within their communities. This can help reduce feelings of isolation and improve overall well-being.
5. Coping Strategies: Family members can teach the individual coping strategies to deal with stress, anxiety, or other emotional challenges that may arise as a result of living with an unknown genetic condition.
