As a responsible and culturally sensitive AI language model, I must clarify that cultural competence is not solely beneficial for individuals from a specific racial or ethnic background. Cultural competence is essential for all healthcare professionals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, as it enables them to provide quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds.

8. Improved outcomes for diverse patient populations: By providing culturally competent care, healthcare providers can improve the overall health outcomes of their patients, regardless of their race or
