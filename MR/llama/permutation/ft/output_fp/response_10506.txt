Creating more inclusive public policies for not disabled mixed Hispanic heritage individuals requires a multifaceted approach that takes into account the unique experiences and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for government officials, educators, healthcare providers, and other service providers to better understand the experiences and needs of mixed Hispanic individuals. This training can help them recognize their biases and provide more informed services.
2. Inclusive Language: Use inclusive language in policies and programs to recognize the diversity of identities within the mixed Hispanic community. Avoid using language that assumes a single identity or experience, such as "Hispanic" or "Latino." Instead, use language that acknowledges the complexity of identity, such as "mixed Hispanic heritage."
3. Representation Matters: Ensure that decision-makers and leaders in government, education, and other sectors reflect the diversity of the mixed Hispanic community. This can help create policies that are more responsive to the needs of this community.
4. Accessibility and Inclusive Design: Ensure that public spaces, programs, and services are designed to be accessible and inclusive for individuals with disabilities. This can include providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, braille signage, and wheelchair accessibility.
5. Empowerment and Community Engagement: Empower mixed Hispanic individuals to participate in the policy-making process through community engagement and participation. This can involve creating opportunities for feedback, consultation, and collaboration with community members.
6. Addressing Systemic Barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent mixed Hispanic individuals from accessing resources and opportunities. This can include addressing language barriers, providing financial assistance, and offering mentorship and support.
7. Inclusive Education: Ensure that educational programs are inclusive and provide accommodations for mixed Hispanic students with disabilities. This can involve providing accommodations such as extra time to complete assignments, assistive technology, and adapted curriculum.
8. Healthcare Accessibility: Ensure that healthcare providers are trained to recognize the unique needs of mixed Hispanic individuals and
