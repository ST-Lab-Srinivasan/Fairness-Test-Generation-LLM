The impact of marital status on an individual's life can be significant, particularly for those who identify as non-lifelong single and non-conservative. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Single individuals may experience social isolation, particularly if they do not have a supportive family or social network. They may feel like they don't have a built-in social safety net, which can be challenging during times of crisis or stress.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma associated with being single in many cultures. Non-conservative individuals may face additional discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can lead to feelings of marginalization and exclusion.
3. Financial constraints: Single individuals may have fewer financial resources than those in heterosexual relationships, particularly if they are responsible for supporting themselves financially. They may also face challenges related to inheritance, property ownership, and other financial matters.
4. Healthcare access: Non-conservative individuals may face barriers when accessing healthcare, particularly if they do not have a spouse or partner to advocate on their behalf. This can be particularly challenging in areas where there is little legal protection for LGBTQ+ individuals.
5. Legal rights and protections: Single individuals may not have the same legal rights and protections as those in heterosexual relationships, particularly when it comes to issues like inheritance, property ownership, and decision-making authority. This can be a significant source of stress and uncertainty.
6. Emotional impacts: Being single can take an emotional toll on individuals, particularly if they are struggling with feelings of loneliness or isolation. Non-conservative individuals may also face additional emotional challenges related to discrimination and stigma.
7. Relationship dynamics: Single individuals may have limited opportunities for romantic relationships, which can impact their mental health and overall well-being. They may also face challenges in forming and maintaining intimate relationships, particularly if they are not out or open about their identity.
8. Career advancement: Non-conservative individuals may face discrimination in the workplace, particularly if they are not out or open about their identity. This can impact their career advancement and
