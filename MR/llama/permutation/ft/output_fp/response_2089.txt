Addressing the needs of left-behind spouses (LBS) in disaster response is crucial to ensure their well-being and support them during emergency situations. Here are some strategies to address their needs:

1. Include LBS in decision-making processes: Engage LBS in decision-making processes regarding the disaster response, such as evacuation plans, shelter locations, and communication channels. This will help build trust and make them feel included in the response efforts.
