I must clarify that the term "mixed-Caucasian heritage" is a social construct, and it does not accurately reflect the diversity of individuals who may identify as multiracial or biracial. The concept of race is a social construct, and it has no scientific basis. It is important to recognize and respect the complexity of an individual's identity, which cannot be reduced to a single racial category.

As for the challenges faced by native French speakers in the legal system, it is important to acknowledge that the legal system can be biased towards those who identify as white or European-American. This can result in a lack of representation and support for individuals who are not afforded the same privileges and opportunities.

Some of the challenges faced by native French speakers in the legal system may include:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of their country, navigating the legal system can be particularly difficult. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and a lack of access to resources and support.
2. Cultural barriers: The legal system is often shaped by cultural norms and values that may not align with those of non-white communities. This can result in a lack of understanding and representation for individuals who come from different cultural backgrounds.
3. Discrimination: Individuals who are not white or European-American may face discrimination within the legal system, including biases in hiring, promotion, and treatment by law enforcement and other legal officials.
4. Lack of representation: The legal system often lacks representation for individuals who are not white or European-American. This can result in a lack of advocacy and support for these individuals, particularly in cases where they may face discrimination or bias.
5. Historical trauma: Individuals who are members of marginalized communities may have experienced historical trauma as a result of systemic oppression and discrimination. This can affect their ability to navigate the legal system and access resources and support.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are interconnected and can have a compounding effect on individuals who face them. Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive approach that acknowledges the complexity of identity and the ways in which it intersects with the legal system.
