As a language educator, it's important to recognize that every individual learner has unique needs and circumstances. When working with ex-spouse beginner Chinese speakers, it's crucial to tailor your teaching approach to meet their specific requirements. Here are some strategies to address the needs of this group in education:

1. Start with basics: Beginners need to build a solid foundation in the language. Focus on teaching basic vocabulary, grammar rules, and pronunciation. Use simple language and avoid complex sentence structures to ensure they can understand and communicate effectively.
2. Use visual aids: Since many ex-spouse beginner Chinese speakers may have limited knowledge of Chinese characters and syntax, incorporate visual aids such as pictures, videos, and flashcards into your lessons. This will help them associate words with meanings and make learning more engaging.
