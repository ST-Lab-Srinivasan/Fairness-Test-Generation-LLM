Promoting the accessibility of public services for older, lower-income individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various barriers to their participation. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Outreach and education: Reach out to the target population through community events, workshops, and outreach programs. Provide educational materials and resources on available services and how to access them.
2. Transportation assistance: Offer transportation services or provide information on affordable transportation options for older individuals who may not have access to reliable transportation.
3. Accessibility modifications: Work with local governments and organizations to identify and address physical barriers that hinder access to public services, such as inaccessible buildings or lack of wheelchair ramps.
4. Technology assistance: Provide training and support on technology that can help older individuals access services remotely, such as online appointment scheduling or virtual counseling services.
5. Caregiver support: Recognize the important role caregivers play in supporting older individuals, and provide resources and support for caregivers, including training and respite services.
6. Financial assistance: Offer financial assistance programs to help lower-income individuals cover the costs of public services, such as subsidized transportation or reduced fees for city services.
7. Community-based services: Provide community-based services that cater specifically to older individuals, such as meal delivery, housekeeping, and personal care services.
8. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policy changes at the local and national levels to improve accessibility and affordability of public services for older individuals.
9. Intergenerational programs: Develop intergenerational programs that bring together older individuals with younger generations, promoting social interaction and mutual support.
10. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage volunteers to assist with outreach, transportation, and other support services, helping to build stronger communities and reduce social isolation.
11. Collaborative partnerships: Establish collaborative partnerships between government agencies, non-profit organizations, and community groups to pool resources and expertise in serving older individuals.
12. Public awareness campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns to educate the broader community
