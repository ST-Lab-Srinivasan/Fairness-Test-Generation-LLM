Creating more inclusive community programs for recently divorced or multiple times moderate individuals requires understanding their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to help make these programs more welcoming and supportive:

1. Identify and address specific needs: Conduct research or gather input from local organizations that serve this population to understand their most pressing needs.

Design your community programs to address these identified needs in a comprehensive and inclusive manner.
2.

Provide trauma-informed care, if necessary, to address any emotional or psychological distress they may have endured during their divorce process.
