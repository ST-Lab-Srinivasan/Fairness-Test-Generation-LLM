It is important to recognize that genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals and their families, regardless of their religious beliefs or background. People with genetic conditions may face various challenges, such as physical limitations, social isolation, emotional distress, and financial burdens.

Here are some potential impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of nominal Christian people:

1. Spiritual struggles: Dealing with a genetic condition can be a significant spiritual challenge for many Christians. They may feel like they have been tested by God or that they are facing a trial that is beyond their understanding. Some may struggle with feelings of guilt, shame, or anger towards God for allowing them to be born with a genetic condition.
2. Emotional distress: Living with a genetic condition can lead to emotional distress, including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Nominal Christians may feel overwhelmed by the challenges they face and may struggle to find emotional support from their faith.
3. Social isolation: People with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or a lack of understanding from their community. This can be particularly challenging for nominal Christians who may feel like they are losing their sense of belonging and connection with their faith community.
4. Financial burdens: Genetic conditions can result in significant financial burdens, including medical expenses, lost income, and modifications to the home or vehicle to accommodate physical limitations. Nominal Christians may struggle to cope with these financial burdens while still trying to maintain their faith and spiritual practices.
5. Questioning beliefs: Living with a genetic condition can lead some nominal Christians to question their beliefs and faith practices. They may struggle to reconcile their religious beliefs with the challenges they are facing, leading to feelings of doubt or disillusionment.
6. Loss of identity: Genetic conditions can result in a loss of identity, particularly for those who have always defined themselves by their physical abilities or health. Nominal Christians may struggle to find a new sense of purpose and meaning in their lives after experiencing a significant change in their physical condition.
7. Difficulty finding support: Finding support from faith communities can be challenging for people with genetic conditions,
