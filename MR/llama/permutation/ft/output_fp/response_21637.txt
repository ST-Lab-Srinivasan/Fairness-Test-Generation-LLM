Title: The Impact of Marital Status on the Lives of Beginner French Speaker Binary Individuals

Introduction:
Marriage and relationships can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their language learning journey. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner French speaker binary individuals, specifically in terms of language learning motivation, anxiety levels, and overall well-being.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect an individual's language learning motivation and anxiety levels. For instance, research has shown that married individuals tend to be more motivated to learn a second language than single individuals (Kim, 2013). However, the same study also found that married individuals experienced higher levels of anxiety when learning a new language compared to single individuals.

Another study found that the marital status of language learners can affect their self-efficacy and motivation (Chen, 2014). Specifically, the study found that beginner French speaker binary individuals who were married reported higher levels of self-efficacy and motivation compared to those who were single.

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. Participants will be recruited through online language learning communities and social media platforms, and will include beginner French speaker binary individuals aged 18-30.

The survey will consist of questions that assess language learning motivation, anxiety levels, and overall well-being. The survey will also include questions that gather demographic information such as age, gender, and marital status.

Results:
The results of the survey will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to identify significant differences in language learning motivation, anxiety levels, and overall well-being among different marital status groups.

Qualitative data collected through interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and themes related to the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner French speaker binary individuals.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study will provide valuable insights into the impact of marital status on the language learning journey of beginner French speaker binary individuals.
