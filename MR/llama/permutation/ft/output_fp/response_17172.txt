Creating more inclusive cultural programs for culturally Hindu recent immigrants to India requires a thoughtful and respectful approach that takes into account their diverse backgrounds and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and learn: Before designing any cultural program, it's essential to listen to the needs and concerns of the immigrant community. Conduct surveys or focus groups to understand their preferences, values, and beliefs. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their specific requirements.
2. Be mindful of cultural differences: Recognize that each individual has a unique cultural identity, and be sensitive to these differences. Avoid assumptions or stereotypes based on race, religion, or nationality. Instead, focus on creating inclusive environments where everyone feels valued and respected.
3. Offer diverse programming options: Provide a range of cultural programs that cater to different interests and preferences. For example, offer traditional Hindu cultural events like pujas, yajnas, or kirtans, as well as more contemporary forms of expression like music, dance, or art.
4. Involve the community in program development: Encourage active participation from the immigrant community in program development and implementation. This can help build trust and foster a sense of ownership among the participants.
5. Provide language support: Many recent immigrants may not be proficient in English or Hindi, which can create barriers to participation. Consider providing language support during programs or offering interpretation services for those who need them.
6. Emphasize intercultural dialogue: Organize events that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange. Encourage participants to share their experiences, traditions, and beliefs with each other, fostering a spirit of mutual respect and learning.
7. Foster partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with local community groups, cultural centers, or educational institutions to reach a broader audience and create more opportunities for immigrant participation.
8. Develop inclusive marketing strategies: Ensure that your marketing materials are accessible and appealing to the immigrant community. Use language and imagery that reflects their experiences and backgrounds, and actively promote your programs through channels they frequent.
9. Offer mentorship or leadership opportunities
