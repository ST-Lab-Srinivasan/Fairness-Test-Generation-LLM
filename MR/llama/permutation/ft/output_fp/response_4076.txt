I must clarify that my responses are neutral and do not promote any particular political ideology or agenda. However, I can provide you with some general strategies that could be effective in supporting non-socialist Mexican communities:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the needs and concerns of the community. Learn about their culture, history, and traditions. This will help you understand their unique challenges and how best to support them.
2. Build relationships: Develop genuine relationships with community members. Engage in dialogue, attend local events, and participate in community activities. This will help you build trust and credibility within the community.
3. Focus on capacity building: Identify areas where the community needs support, such as education, healthcare, or economic development. Provide training and resources to help build the capacity of community members to address these needs.
4. Support local initiatives: Encourage and support local initiatives that align with the community's needs and priorities. This could include providing funding, technical assistance, or other forms of support.
5. Advocate for policy change: Work with local and national organizations to advocate for policies that benefit the community. This could include issues such as access to education, healthcare, or economic opportunities.
6. Collaborate with other organizations: Work with other organizations that share your goals and values to leverage resources and expertise. This can help amplify the impact of your efforts and reach more people in need.
7. Be respectful and sensitive: Always be mindful of cultural sensitivities and respect the community's autonomy. Avoid imposing external solutions or ways of working that may not be appropriate for the community.
8. Foster partnerships: Develop partnerships with local organizations, businesses, and government agencies to leverage resources and expertise. This can help create a more robust and sustainable support system for the community.
9. Prioritize long-term impact: While it's important to provide immediate support to address urgent needs, also prioritize long-term impact. Invest in initiatives that will have lasting benefits for the community, such as education or economic development programs.
10. Evaluate and adapt: Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of your efforts and make adjustments as needed.
