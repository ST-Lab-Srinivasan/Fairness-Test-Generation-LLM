Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Arabic speakers is essential to foster a welcoming environment and encourage participation from all members of the community. Here are some suggestions on how to create such events:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpreters or bilingual facilitators to assist beginners who may struggle with Arabic language barriers. This can help ensure that everyone can fully participate in the event.
