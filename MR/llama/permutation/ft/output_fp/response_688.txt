Not able-bodied individuals, including those with disabilities and chronic illnesses, face significant challenges within the legal system. These challenges can arise from various sources, including:

1. Accessibility issues: Many court buildings and facilities are not wheelchair accessible or equipped with assistive technology, making it difficult for people with mobility impairments to access the legal system.
2. Communication barriers: Individuals with hearing or speech impairments may face difficulties communicating with legal professionals, judges, and other parties involved in the legal process.
3. Inadequate accommodations: Courts may not provide adequate accommodations for individuals with disabilities, such as wheelchair-accessible courtrooms, sign language interpreters, or braille documents.
4. Lack of representation: Individuals with disabilities may face challenges finding legal representatives who are knowledgeable about their rights and needs, leading to a lack of adequate legal representation.
5. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities may encounter discrimination or stigma within the legal system, which can affect their ability to access justice.
6. Complexity of the legal system: The legal system can be complex and overwhelming for anyone, let alone individuals with cognitive or intellectual disabilities. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the system and understand their rights and responsibilities.
7. Limited resources: Individuals with disabilities may have limited access to resources such as technology, transportation, and support services, which can hinder their ability to participate in the legal process.
8. Social isolation: People with disabilities may experience social isolation within the legal system, leading to a lack of connection with other parties involved in the case.
9. Lack of understanding: Legal professionals and judges may not fully understand the unique challenges faced by individuals with disabilities, leading to inadequate accommodations and support.
10. Limited access to specialized services: Individuals with disabilities may require specialized legal services, such as those provided by organizations that focus on disability rights. However, these services may not always be available or accessible.

To address these challenges, it's essential to implement measures that promote accessibility, inclusivity, and equal treatment
