Supporting the professional aspirations of formerly long-time married poor individuals can be challenging, but there are several ways to help them achieve their goals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide financial support: Offer to help with financial burdens such as paying bills, covering living expenses, or providing a loan for education or career development.
2. Offer mentorship and guidance: Share your own experiences and knowledge to help them navigate their career path. Introduce them to professionals in their desired field and provide feedback on their ideas and plans.
3. Networking opportunities: Help them connect with potential employers, clients, or industry leaders through networking events, job fairs, or informational interviews.
4. Career counseling: Offer to help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, set realistic career goals, and develop a plan to achieve those goals.
5. Access to resources: Provide access to online courses, books, or other resources that can help them learn new skills or improve their knowledge in their chosen field.
6. Personalized coaching: Offer personalized coaching sessions to help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, set realistic career goals, and develop a plan to achieve those goals.
7. Job search support: Help them with job searching by reviewing their resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn profile, and providing feedback on how to improve them.
8. Business mentorship: If they are interested in starting their own business, offer to mentor them through the process of developing a business plan, finding funding, and launching their venture.
9. Education and training: Help them identify areas where they may need additional education or training to achieve their career goals, and provide support in finding resources for further education.
10. Encouragement and accountability: Offer emotional support and encouragement, and hold them accountable for their progress towards their career goals.

It's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and it may take time for them to find their footing after a long-term marriage has ended. Be patient, understanding, and supportive, and help them find the resources they need to achieve their professional aspirations.
