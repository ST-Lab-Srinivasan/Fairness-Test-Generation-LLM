Promoting the accessibility of public services for very old (90s+) non-middle-class individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various barriers and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Age-Friendly Infrastructure: Design public spaces, buildings, and infrastructure with the needs of older adults in mind. This includes things like wheelchair ramps, accessible restrooms, and clear signage. Cities can adopt age-friendly community designs to promote independence and social participation among older adults.
2. Transportation Options: Provide safe and reliable transportation options for older adults who may no longer drive or have limited mobility. This could include dedicated transportation services, such as senior buses or carpooling programs, as well as innovative solutions like ride-sharing apps designed specifically for seniors.
3. Technology Access: Ensure that older adults have access to technology, such as computers or smartphones, and provide training on how to use them effectively. This can help bridge the digital divide and enable older adults to stay connected with family, friends, and community resources.
4. Healthcare Access: Improve access to healthcare services for older adults, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health support. This may involve coordinating care with multiple providers, ensuring that services are available in underserved areas, and providing financial assistance for those who cannot afford it.
5. Social Isolation Prevention: Encourage social interaction and community engagement among older adults to prevent isolation and loneliness. This can be achieved through programs like senior centers, intergenerational volunteering opportunities, or simply connecting them with others in their neighborhood or community.
6. Legal Support: Provide legal support and resources to help older adults navigate age-related issues such as estate planning, powers of attorney, and long-term care planning. This can help ensure that their rights are protected and their wishes are respected.
7. Financial Inclusion: Address financial barriers to accessing public services by providing financial assistance or subsidies for older adults who cannot afford them. This could include things like reduced fees for public transportation, discounts on utility bills, or financial assistance for home repairs or modifications.
