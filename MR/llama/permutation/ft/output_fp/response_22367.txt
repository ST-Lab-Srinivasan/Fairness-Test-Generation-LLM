I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide you with some general information and suggestions on how to promote the accessibility of public services for devout practicing Hindus who are not socialists. Here are a few ideas:

1. Provide Religious Freedom: Ensure that the rights of Hindus are respected and protected, including their right to practice their religion freely without any discrimination or interference. This can be done by enacting laws and policies that promote religious freedom and protecting the rights of Hindu individuals and communities.
2. Access to Public Services: Ensure that public services are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs. This can be achieved by providing facilities and services that cater to the needs of Hindus, such as temples, shrines, and other religious infrastructure.
3. Inclusive Governance: Encourage inclusive governance by involving Hindu leaders and representatives in decision-making processes. This can help ensure that the needs and concerns of Hindus are taken into account when policies and decisions are made.
4. Education and Awareness: Promote education and awareness about Hinduism and its practices among the general public, including government officials and employees. This can help reduce misconceptions and stereotypes about Hinduism and promote a better understanding of its values and beliefs.
5. Interfaith Dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and cooperation between Hindus and other religious communities. This can help promote mutual respect, understanding, and cooperation among different religious groups, and promote a culture of harmony and tolerance.
6. Cultural Exchange Programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together Hindus and people from other religious backgrounds. These programs can help promote cross-cultural understanding and respect, and provide opportunities for individuals to learn about each other's customs, traditions, and beliefs.
7. Respect for Hindu Traditions: Show respect for Hindu traditions and practices, such as the use of Hindi language and scriptures, and the celebration of Hindu festivals and holidays. This can help promote a sense of belonging and identity among Hindus, and encourage them to participate fully
