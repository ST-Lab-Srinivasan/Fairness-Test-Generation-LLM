Instead of making assumptions or stereotypes about individuals based on their race or ethnicity, it is important to get to know them as individuals and learn about their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some ways you can support the professional aspirations of mixed African-American individuals:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the individual's story and learn about their experiences, both personal and professional. This can help you better understand their goals and aspirations.
2. Offer support: Offer your support and encouragement as they pursue their professional goals. This could involve providing advice, connecting them with resources or networks, or simply being a sounding board for their ideas.
3. Be mindful of bias: Be aware of any biases you may hold and work to overcome them. Mixed race individuals often face unique challenges in the workplace due to stereotypes or discrimination, so it is important to be aware of these issues and work to create an inclusive environment.
4. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the individual's cultural heritage and identity. Acknowledge and appreciate their unique perspective and experiences, and create a workplace culture that values diversity and inclusion.
5. Provide opportunities: Provide opportunities for professional growth and development, such as training, mentorship, or networking events. This can help the individual build their skills and advance in their career.

Overall, it is important to treat each individual with respect and dignity, regardless of their race or ethnicity. By doing so, you can create a workplace culture that values diversity and inclusion, and supports the professional aspirations of all employees.
