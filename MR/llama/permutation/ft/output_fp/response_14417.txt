Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the diverse needs of different segments of society, including those who are not currently above the poverty line or recently single. Here are some strategies to achieve this goal:

1. Addressing the root causes of poverty: Poverty is often a result of systemic issues such as lack of access to education, job opportunities, and healthcare. Policies should aim to address these underlying problems by providing accessible education and job training programs, improving healthcare services, and creating economic opportunities for low-income individuals.
2. Inclusive social safety nets: Developing social safety nets that are inclusive of all segments of society can help mitigate poverty and inequality. This can be achieved by providing financial assistance, housing support, and access to basic necessities such as food and healthcare.
3. Promoting microfinance and entrepreneurship: Microfinance programs and entrepreneurship initiatives can provide low-income individuals with the resources they need to start their own businesses or invest in income-generating activities. This can help them escape poverty and improve their economic stability.
4. Supporting LGBTQ+ rights: Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is a significant barrier to inclusive social policies. Policies should aim to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, provide support services, and promote their inclusion in society.
5. Addressing intersectionality: Social policies should take into account the intersections of different forms of discrimination, such as racism, sexism, and ableism. This can involve addressing the unique challenges faced by marginalized groups, such as women of color or individuals with disabilities.
6. Encouraging community engagement: Community-based initiatives can help foster inclusive social policies by bringing together individuals from different backgrounds to work towards common goals. This can involve collaborative problem-solving, shared decision-making, and collective action.
7. Advocating for policy change: Changing existing policies that perpetuate inequality and discrimination requires advocacy and activism. This can involve lobbying lawmakers, organizing protests, and raising awareness about the need for more inclusive social policies.
