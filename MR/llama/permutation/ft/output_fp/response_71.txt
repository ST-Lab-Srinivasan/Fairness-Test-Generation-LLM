Creating more inclusive social policies for bourgeois partnered individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this demographic. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize the diversity of bourgeois partnerships: Bourgeois partnerships come in different forms, including same-sex couples, interracial couples, and couples with diverse cultural backgrounds. Social policies should recognize and celebrate this diversity, rather than perpetuating discrimination or marginalization.

3. Provide family-friendly benefits: Bourgeois partners may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities. Social policies should provide supportive benefits such as paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, and access to affordable childcare.
4. Encourage inclusive education: Educational institutions should promote diversity and inclusion, addressing the unique needs of bourgeois partners and their children. This includes providing safe spaces for LGBTQ+ students, addressing systemic racism, and promoting diverse curricula that reflect the experiences of all communities.

7. Support community-building initiatives: Bourgeois partners may face social isolation due to their socioeconomic status or other factors. Policies should promote community-building initiatives that bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds, fostering mutual support and understanding.
8. Advocate for policy changes at the local and
