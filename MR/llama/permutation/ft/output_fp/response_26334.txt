Creating more inclusive recreational activities for active-duty secular Jewish people requires understanding their needs and preferences, as well as addressing any potential barriers to participation. Here are some suggestions:

1. Survey and gather feedback: Conduct a survey or focus groups to gather input from active-duty secular Jewish service members on what types of recreational activities they would like to participate in. This will help identify their interests and preferences, which can guide the development of inclusive activities.
2. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of recreational activities that cater to different interests and abilities, such as team sports, individual sports, yoga, meditation, or creative pursuits like art or music. This will allow service members to choose the activities that best suit their preferences and needs.
3. Make facilities accessible: Ensure that recreational facilities are accessible and comfortable for all service members, regardless of their background or beliefs. Provide gender-neutral spaces, prayer rooms, or other accommodations as needed.
4. Promote inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity by providing educational resources and workshops on diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can help service members understand and appreciate the perspectives and practices of their Jewish peers.
5. Develop partnerships: Collaborate with local Jewish organizations or communities to develop recreational activities that are tailored to the needs and preferences of active-duty secular Jewish service members. This can help create a sense of belonging and connection to the broader Jewish community.
6. Provide flexible scheduling: Offer recreational activities at various times to accommodate different schedules and needs, such as early morning, lunchtime, or evening sessions. This will enable service members to participate in activities that fit their busy military routines.
7. Offer virtual options: Consider offering virtual recreational activities for service members who may be stationed at remote locations or have limited access to physical spaces. This can include online classes, workshops, or social events.
8. Provide equipment and resources: Ensure that recreational facilities are well-equipped with necessary resources, such as sports gear, fitness equipment, or creative supplies. Offer loaner programs or financial assistance for service members who may need additional support
