This can involve using visual aids, videos, and other multimedia resources that are available in both French and English. This can help students who are native French speakers feel more engaged and included in the learning process.
4. Cultural exchange programs: Consider implementing cultural exchange programs that bring together students from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. These programs can provide valuable opportunities for students to learn about each other's cultures, traditions, and ways of life.
