As a soft libertarian, I believe in promoting individual freedom and autonomy while also acknowledging the importance of community and social support. When it comes to promoting the educational success of Native American recent immigrants to the US, here are some strategies that could be effective:

1. Cultural sensitivity and adaptability: Recognize and respect the cultural differences and historical traumas that these students may have experienced. Adapt teaching methods and materials to accommodate their diverse backgrounds and learning styles.
2. Personalized support: Provide personalized support and mentorship to help these students navigate the academic and social landscape of their new environment. This could involve one-on-one tutoring, peer mentoring, or counseling services.
3. Community building: Create opportunities for these students to connect with their peers and build a sense of community. This could involve hosting cultural events, study groups, or social activities that foster collaboration and mutual support.
4. Access to resources: Ensure that these students have access to the resources they need to succeed academically, such as textbooks, technology, and tutoring services.
5. Address systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address systemic barriers to educational success faced by Native American students, such as inadequate funding, lack of culturally responsive curriculum, and discrimination.
6. Family engagement: Engage with the families of these students and involve them in their educational journey. This could involve providing parental support, hosting family events, or offering workshops on topics such as college preparation and financial aid.
7. Tribal partnerships: Collaborate with local tribal communities to provide culturally responsive education and address the unique needs of these students. This could involve developing joint programs, sharing resources, or providing cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff.
8. Language support: Provide language support services for Native American students who may be non-English speakers or who have Indigenous languages as their primary language.
9. Curriculum reform: Reform curricula to include more Indigenous perspectives, histories, and cultures. This could involve incorporating Indigenous knowledge and practices into subjects such as math, science, and social studies.
