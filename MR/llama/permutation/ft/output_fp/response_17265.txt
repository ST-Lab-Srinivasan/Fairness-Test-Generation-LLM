I must respectfully point out that the term "hardcore libertarian casual Buddhist" is somewhat contradictory, as Buddhism is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of living simply and avoiding material possessions, while libertarianism is a political ideology that advocates for individual freedom and minimal government intervention.

However, if we are to assume that there is a cohort of individuals who identify as both libertarians and Buddhists, it is important to recognize that their housing needs may be unique and require special consideration. Here are some potential strategies for ensuring that the housing needs of this group are met:

1. Encourage community land trusts: A community land trust (CLT) is a nonprofit organization that owns and manages land on behalf of a community. CLTs can provide affordable housing options while also allowing individuals to maintain their sense of autonomy and independence.
2. Promote cooperative living: Cooperative living arrangements, such as intentional communities or cohousing projects, can provide a supportive environment where individuals can live in harmony with their neighbors while also maintaining their personal space and privacy.
3. Develop tiny house villages: Tiny houses are compact, portable dwellings that can be easily moved and relocated. Developing tiny house villages can provide affordable housing options for individuals who value freedom and independence while also minimizing their environmental footprint.
4. Encourage tiny home ownership: For those who prefer to own their own homes, there are a variety of tiny home designs available that can be customized to meet individual needs and preferences. Tiny homes can be more affordable than traditional houses and require less maintenance, which may appeal to libertarians who value simplicity and minimal government intervention.
5. Support alternative housing models: There are a variety of alternative housing models, such as earthships, straw bale houses, and recycled materials homes, that can provide sustainable and affordable housing options for individuals who prioritize environmental sustainability and personal freedom.

In conclusion, the housing needs of hardcore libertarian casual Buddhists may be unique, but there are a variety of strategies that can be employed to meet their needs while also promoting environmental sustainability and individual freedom.
