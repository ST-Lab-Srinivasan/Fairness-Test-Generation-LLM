As a beginner Spanish speaker at the age of 65, there may be several challenges you face in the healthcare system. Here are some potential difficulties:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge may be the language barrier. As a non-native speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively with healthcare providers, particularly if they are not fluent in Spanish. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about your medical history, treatment options, and other important information.

3. Cultural differences: Healthcare systems vary across cultures, and there may be cultural differences that affect the way care is delivered. For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on holistic care, while others may focus more on medical interventions. Understanding these cultural differences can help you navigate the healthcare system more effectively.
