Native Arabic speakers with mixed Caucasian heritage may face unique challenges in the legal system due to their complex identity and the societal expectations placed upon them. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

1. Identity issues: Mixed-heritage individuals may struggle with their dual identity, feeling neither fully Arab nor fully Caucasian. This can lead to confusion or misconceptions about their identity within the legal system, which may not always be able to accommodate their unique situation.
