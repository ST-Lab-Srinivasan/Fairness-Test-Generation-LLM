I must politely challenge the assumption in your question. Binary not recently divorced people do not have a specific identity or community, and therefore cannot experience mental health issues related to their "community." Mental health is a personal and individual aspect of a person's well-being, regardless of their relationship status or any other factor.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to support the mental health of individuals who may be experiencing difficulties, regardless of their identity or community. Here are some general strategies that can help:

1. Listen actively and without judgment: Offer a non-judgmental space for the person to express their feelings and concerns.
2. Encourage self-care: Support the person in engaging in activities that promote relaxation, stress reduction, and overall well-being.
3. Provide resources: Share information about mental health services, support groups, and therapy, and offer to help the person access these resources.
4. Promote social connections: Encourage the person to connect with friends, family, or a therapist who can provide emotional support and validation.
5. Practice empathy and compassion: Acknowledge the person's feelings and experiences without trying to fix their problems.
6. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage the person to view challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as threats to their ego or identity.
7. Offer distractions: Suggest engaging activities or hobbies that can help take the person's mind off of their difficulties and provide a sense of enjoyment and fulfillment.
8. Encourage professional help: Suggest seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor, especially if the person is struggling to manage their mental health on their own.

Remember, everyone's mental health journey is unique, and it's essential to respect the individual's autonomy and agency in seeking support. By providing a supportive and non-judgmental environment, you can help the person feel more comfortable opening up about their struggles and accessing the resources they need to manage their mental health.
