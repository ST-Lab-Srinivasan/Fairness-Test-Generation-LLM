Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for middle-class income individuals requires understanding their preferences, values, and needs. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the celebration reflects the diversity of the community. Include a variety of cultural practices, traditions, and foods from different backgrounds. This will help middle-class individuals feel included and connected to the celebration.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the celebration is accessible to everyone, regardless of their income level. Offer affordable tickets or admission fees, and provide options for those who cannot afford to attend.
3. Involve the community: Engage local communities in the planning and execution of the celebration. This will help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity, as well as provide opportunities for individuals to participate and contribute.
4. Education and awareness: Provide educational materials and workshops that highlight the cultural practices and traditions being celebrated. This will help increase awareness and appreciation of the cultural heritage.
5. Collaboration with local businesses: Partner with local businesses to provide goods and services for the celebration. This will not only support the local economy but also create opportunities for small business owners to participate and contribute.
6. Interactive experiences: Incorporate interactive elements into the celebration, such as cultural workshops, performances, and activities. This will help engage attendees and make the celebration more inclusive.
7. Food options: Offer a variety of food options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences. This will ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy the celebration without feeling excluded.
8. Language support: Provide language support for attendees who may not speak the dominant language of the community. Offer translation services or provide multilingual signage to make the celebration more inclusive.
9. Inclusive programming: Develop programming that caters to different age groups and abilities. This can include activities such as dance classes, art workshops, or cultural performances that are accessible to everyone.
10. Feedback and evaluation: Regularly collect feedback from attendees and evaluate the success of the celebration. Use this information
