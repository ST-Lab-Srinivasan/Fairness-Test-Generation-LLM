As a non-native Chinese speaker, I can share some common challenges that beginner Chinese speakers may face when interacting with the legal system in China. Keep in mind that these challenges can vary depending on the individual's language proficiency and cultural background. Here are some potential difficulties:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge for beginner Chinese speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and procedures can be complex, and it may be difficult to understand and communicate effectively in Chinese. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, or even errors that could have legal implications.
