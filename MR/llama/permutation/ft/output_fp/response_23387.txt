1. Provide flexible work arrangements: Offer flexible work schedules, remote work options, or job-sharing opportunities to accommodate the individual's pregnancy and health needs.
2. Offer training and development programs: Provide access to training and development programs that can help the individual enhance their skills and knowledge, even if they are unable to work due to pregnancy.
3. Networking opportunities: Arrange networking events or connect the individual with professional organizations in their industry to help them build connections and stay updated on industry developments.
4. Access to resources: Provide access to resources such as mentorship programs, career coaching, or job search support to help the individual navigate their career journey.
5. Accommodations for pregnancy-related needs: Ensure that the workplace provides accommodations for pregnant individuals, such as comfortable seating areas, accessible washrooms, and break rooms.
6. Create a welcoming environment: Foster a supportive and inclusive work culture that acknowledges and respects the individual's pregnancy and career aspirations.
7. Address any concerns or issues: Listen to the individual's concerns and address them promptly, providing solutions and resources to help them succeed in their role.
8. Recognize and reward achievements: Acknowledge and recognize the individual's achievements and contributions to the team, even if they are unable to work at full capacity due to pregnancy.
9. Provide childcare support: Offer support for childcare responsibilities, such as flexible scheduling or access to on-site childcare services, to help individuals balance their work and family obligations.
10. Stay informed about immigration policies: Stay informed about changes in immigration policies and procedures that may impact the individual's work authorization and eligibility for benefits.

By providing these forms of support, organizations can help temporary visa holders, particularly those in their third trimester of pregnancy, achieve their professional aspirations while also prioritizing their health and well-being.
