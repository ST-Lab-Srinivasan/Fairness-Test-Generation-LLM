Creating more inclusive community programs for active-duty lifelong learners, or singles, can be done by taking into account their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer flexible programming: Active-duty service members often have unpredictable schedules and may not be able to attend programs during traditional hours. Consider offering programs in the evenings or on weekends, or providing online options.
2. Provide childcare support: Single service members may struggle to find affordable, high-quality childcare while they are pursuing their educational goals. Consider partnering with local organizations that provide childcare services, or offering on-base resources such as childcare centers or drop-in care.
3. Address financial challenges: Financial constraints can be a significant barrier to educational success for single service members. Consider offering scholarships, grants, or other forms of financial assistance to help offset the costs of tuition and other expenses.
4. Foster a sense of community: Single service members may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers due to their military commitments. Create opportunities for single service members to connect with one another, such as social events or mentorship programs.
5. Be mindful of deployment considerations: Deployment can be a significant challenge for single service members who are pursuing their educational goals. Consider offering flexible scheduling options or alternative delivery methods (e.g., online courses) to help accommodate the needs of deploying service members.
6. Provide support for mental health and wellness: Single service members may face unique challenges related to stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues. Offer counseling services or mental health resources specifically tailored to the needs of single service members.
7. Recognize the importance of self-care: Single service members often have a heavy workload and may not prioritize self-care. Encourage single service members to prioritize their own well-being by offering relaxation techniques, stress management workshops, or other self-care resources.
8. Create a supportive learning environment: Single service members may face challenges related to balancing military obligations with academic demands. Create a supportive learning environment that acknowledges these challenges and provides resources to help single service members succeed academically.
