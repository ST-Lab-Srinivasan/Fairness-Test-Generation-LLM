As a professor and researcher, I believe it is essential to address the specific needs of long-time devout Muslim individuals who are also widowed in college. Here are some suggestions on how to support these students:

1. Provide Islamic counseling services: Offer one-on-one or group counseling sessions with an Islamic therapist who can provide emotional support and help them cope with their grief. These sessions can be conducted in a private room on campus or through online platforms.
2. Organize grief support groups: Facilitate grief support groups for widowed students where they can share their experiences, emotions, and challenges with others who are going through similar situations. These groups can provide a safe space for students to express themselves and feel supported.
3. Offer flexible prayer schedules: Many college campuses have limited prayer spaces or unpredictable schedules that make it difficult for students to pray at the same time every day. Consider offering flexible prayer schedules or creating designated prayer rooms with comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and easy access to clean water and ablution facilities.
4. Provide halal food options: Ensure that there are halal food options available on campus, including meals in the cafeteria, snacks in vending machines, or even grocery delivery services. This can help alleviate any stress or anxiety related to finding halal food while studying.
5. Offer cultural and religious events: Organize events that celebrate Islamic culture and traditions, such as Eid celebrations, iftar parties during Ramadan, or lectures on Islamic history and philosophy. These events can help students connect with their faith and heritage while also providing opportunities for socialization and community building.
6. Create a supportive campus environment: Encourage non-Muslim students and faculty to be respectful of Muslim students' beliefs and practices, and provide training on cultural competence and sensitivity. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming campus environment for all students.
7. Provide academic support: Offer academic support services such as tutoring, study groups, or academic advising to help widowed Muslim students who may be struggling academically due to their personal circumstances.
8. Encourage student involvement in campus organizations
