Creating more inclusive cultural events for ex-spouses of active-duty military personnel requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of ex-spouses: Before planning any event, it's essential to understand the needs and preferences of ex-spouses.
