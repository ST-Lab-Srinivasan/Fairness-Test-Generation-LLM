Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, especially those who are newly married, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space for expression: Beginner Arabic speakers may feel hesitant to express their opinions or participate in decision-making processes due to language barriers or cultural differences. Creating a safe and inclusive environment where they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions can go a long way in ensuring their voices are heard.
2. Use visual aids: Arabic speakers who are not fluent in the language may struggle to communicate their ideas through spoken language alone. Using visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos can help them express themselves more effectively.
3. Provide translation support: Offering translation support during decision-making processes can help beginner Arabic speakers participate more fully. This could involve providing real-time translations, using interpreters, or offering written translations of important documents.
4. Encourage participation in small groups: Beginner Arabic speakers may feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions in smaller groups where they can communicate more easily. Encouraging participation in small groups can help them build confidence and feel more included in the decision-making process.
5. Foster a culture of inclusion: Creating a culture of inclusion within organizations or communities can help ensure that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers are heard. This involves promoting diversity, equity, and inclusivity in all aspects of decision-making processes.
6. Provide language training: Offering language training programs specifically designed for beginner Arabic speakers can help them improve their communication skills and feel more confident participating in decision-making processes.
7. Use technology to facilitate communication: Technology can play a significant role in bridging the language gap between beginner Arabic speakers and those who are fluent in the language. Tools such as video conferencing, instant messaging apps, or social media platforms can help facilitate communication and ensure that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers are heard.
8. Build relationships: Building trusting relationships with beginner Arabic speakers can help them feel more comfortable participating in decision-making processes. This involves taking the time to listen to their concerns, build rapport, and establish common ground.
