Addressing the specific needs of native English speaker Nigerians in healthcare requires a comprehensive approach that considers their cultural background, language barriers, and healthcare seeking behaviors. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for healthcare providers to enable them to understand the cultural beliefs and practices of Nigerian communities, particularly those who speak English as a first language. This will help healthcare providers to communicate effectively with patients and provide care that is sensitive to their cultural needs.
2. Language Support: Provide language support services such as interpreters or translated materials to assist non-English speaking patients in navigating the healthcare system. This can help reduce language barriers and improve communication between healthcare providers and patients.
3. Patient Education: Develop patient education materials that are tailored to the needs of native English speaker Nigerians. These materials should be written in a way that is easy to understand, free of technical jargon, and include visual aids where possible. This can help patients better understand their health conditions and treatment options.
4. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to educate native English speaker Nigerians about the importance of preventive care and early disease detection. This can be done through community events, workshops, and health fairs where patients can receive free or low-cost health screenings and consultations with healthcare providers.
5. Collaboration with Community Leaders: Collaborate with community leaders and organizations to promote healthcare access and utilization among native English speaker Nigerians. This can involve partnering with local churches, mosques, and other community organizations to disseminate health information and provide referrals to healthcare services.
6. Healthcare Literacy: Develop healthcare literacy programs that are tailored to the needs of native English speaker Nigerians. These programs should be designed to improve patients' understanding of their health conditions, treatment options, and how to navigate the healthcare system.
7. Patient Advocacy: Train patient advocates who can provide cultural brokering services between healthcare providers and patients from diverse backgrounds. These advocates can help bridge language and cultural barriers and ensure that patients receive culturally sensitive care.
