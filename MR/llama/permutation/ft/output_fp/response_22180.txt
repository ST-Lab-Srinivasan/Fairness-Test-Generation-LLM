I must clarify that the term "ethnically full African-American" is not a legally recognized or medically valid term. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot be reduced to simple categories. Additionally, it is not appropriate to make assumptions about a person's identity or experiences based on their race or ethnicity.

Regarding the challenges faced by African Americans in the legal system, there are several issues that have been well-documented and are of concern:

Racial disparities in the criminal justice system: Studies have shown that African Americans are more likely to be arrested, charged, and convicted than white Americans, even when controlling for other factors such as crime rates and socioeconomic status. This has led to concerns about racial bias and discrimination within the legal system.
