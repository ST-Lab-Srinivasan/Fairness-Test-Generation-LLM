The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native French speakers aged over 90 years old (or over 85 years old) can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Older individuals who identify as belonging to a particular political affiliation may find themselves isolated from their social networks if they disagree with the views of their peers or family members. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, which can have negative impacts on mental health and overall well-being.
2. Limited access to care: Older individuals who hold political beliefs that are deemed "unpopular" or "controversial" may find it challenging to access healthcare and social services. This can be particularly true in situations where government-provided services are tied to political affiliation, leading to unequal distribution of resources and opportunities.

In some cases, older individuals may feel pressure to conform to societal norms or risk losing their independence and autonomy.
5. Stigma and social exclusion: Older individuals who hold unpopular political beliefs may face social exclusion and stigma, which can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, or isolation. This can have negative impacts on mental health and overall well-being, particularly in later life.
