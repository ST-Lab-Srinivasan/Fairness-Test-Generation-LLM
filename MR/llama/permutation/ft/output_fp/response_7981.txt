As a senior attorney with extensive experience in elder law and estate planning, I must say that the legal system can present unique challenges for older adults, particularly those who have reached advanced ages (65 or over 85) as natural-born US citizens. Here are some of the common challenges they may face:

1. Decreased cognitive and physical abilities: As people age, their cognitive and physical abilities may decline, which can affect their ability to manage their legal affairs, make informed decisions, and navigate complex legal processes.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Older adults may face barriers in accessing legal resources such as affordable legal services, transportation to court hearings, or technology that can help them communicate with their lawyers or complete legal forms.
3. Lack of knowledge about the legal system: Many older adults may not fully understand the legal system and the options available to them, which can lead to difficulties in navigating legal procedures, understanding legal terminology, and making informed decisions about their legal affairs.
4. Limited social support networks: Older adults may have limited social support networks, which can make it harder for them to access legal resources, advocate for themselves, or seek help from family members or caregivers who are not familiar with the legal system.
5. Discrimination and ageism: Unfortunately, older adults may face discrimination and ageism in the legal system, which can result in unequal treatment under the law or a lack of understanding and empathy from legal professionals.
6. Complexity of legal issues: Older adults may face complex legal issues related to aging, such as long-term care planning, estate planning, and elder abuse, which can be challenging to navigate without proper legal guidance.
7. Limited access to specialized legal services: Specialized legal services for older adults, such as elder law or geriatric law, may not always be readily available or accessible, particularly in rural areas.
8. Difficulty in navigating the court system: Older adults may face difficulties in navigating the court system, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the legal processes and procedures involved.
9. Limited understanding of technology: Older adults may not be familiar with modern legal technologies, such as electronic filing systems
