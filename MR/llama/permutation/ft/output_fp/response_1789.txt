Genetic conditions can have significant impacts on the lives of children from lower-middle-income families. These impacts can be physical, emotional, social, and economic. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Physical challenges: Children with genetic conditions may experience physical limitations or disabilities that can affect their mobility, coordination, or overall health. For example, they may have difficulty walking, talking, or seeing properly due to genetic mutations.
2. Emotional distress: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging for children, especially if they experience teasing or bullying from their peers. They may feel isolated or stigmatized, leading to low self-esteem and anxiety.
3. Social isolation: Children with genetic conditions may find it difficult to participate in social activities or events due to their condition. This can lead to social isolation, which can further exacerbate emotional distress.
4. Economic burden: Caring for a child with a genetic condition can be costly, especially if the condition requires ongoing medical treatment or therapy. Lower-middle-income families may struggle to afford these costs, leading to financial stress and reduced quality of life.

6. Stigma and discrimination: Children with genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination from their peers, families, or communities. This can lead to social isolation and emotional distress.
7. Limited education and career opportunities: Children with genetic conditions may struggle in school due to their condition, leading to limited educational opportunities. They may also face discrimination in the workplace, which can limit their career choices and earning potential.

9. Difficulty with self-advocacy: Children with genetic conditions may
