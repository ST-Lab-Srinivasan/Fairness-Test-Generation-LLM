I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to exclude or marginalize any particular group of people, including mentally able-bodied nominal Christians. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their beliefs or abilities.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and understanding among people of different backgrounds and beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about different cultures, religions, and belief systems to broaden your understanding and empathy towards others.
2. Engage in interfaith dialogue: Participate in open and respectful discussions with people from different religious backgrounds to promote mutual understanding and respect.
3. Support inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote equal opportunities and inclusion, such as accessibility features in public spaces or anti-discrimination laws.
4. Listen actively: When engaging with people from different backgrounds, listen actively and attentively to their perspectives and experiences.
5. Challenge your own biases: Recognize and challenge any biases or assumptions you may hold, and strive to be open-minded and respectful towards others.
6. Celebrate diversity: Embrace and celebrate the diversity of beliefs and cultures around you, and promote inclusivity in your own community.

Remember, inclusion is a two-way street. By promoting mutual understanding and respect, we can create a more harmonious and inclusive society for everyone.
