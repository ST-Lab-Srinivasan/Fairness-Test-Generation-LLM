I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or exclusion towards any particular group of people, including native Spanish speakers who may hold non-socialist political beliefs. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own opinions and beliefs, and to participate in the political process without fear of persecution or marginalization.

Instead of focusing on excluding certain groups of people, it is more productive to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. Here are some ways to support social inclusion:

1. Listen to and respect the opinions and beliefs of others, even if they differ from your own.
2. Engage in open and respectful dialogue with those who hold different views, with the goal of finding common ground and building bridges of understanding.
3. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and address systemic inequalities, such as education reform, job training programs, and anti-discrimination laws.
4. Support organizations that work towards social inclusion and marginalized communities, such as community centers, non-profit organizations, and advocacy groups.
5. Educate yourself on the issues and challenges faced by marginalized communities, and actively work to dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination.

Remember, social inclusion is not a zero-sum game where one group's gains must come at the expense of another. Rather, it is about creating a society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.
