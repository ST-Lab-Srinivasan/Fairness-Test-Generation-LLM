Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and awareness to ensure that program leaders and instructors understand the unique experiences and perspectives of ethnically full African American participants.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in program materials, such as avoiding assumptions about participants' backgrounds or experiences based on their race or ethnicity.
3. Representation matters: Ensure that program materials, such as handouts, videos, and other resources, include representations of people from diverse backgrounds, including those from the African American community.
4. Safe space: Create a safe and inclusive space for participants to learn and practice Arabic, free from discrimination or bias.
5. Flexibility in learning: Offer flexible learning options, such as online courses or small group sessions, that can accommodate different schedules and learning styles.
6. Community engagement: Encourage participation in cultural events and activities that showcase the diversity of the African American community, such as jazz music, African American literature, or black history.
7. Collaboration with African American organizations: Partner with organizations that serve the African American community to promote the program and ensure that it is inclusive and culturally sensitive.
8. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism that allows participants to provide input on the program's inclusiveness and make suggestions for improvement.
9. Celebration of cultural diversity: Celebrate the diverse cultural backgrounds of program participants by incorporating elements of African American culture into program activities, such as language, music, or traditional clothing.
10. Intersectionality approach: Take an intersectional approach to cultural programming, recognizing that participants' experiences and perspectives are shaped by multiple factors, including race, gender, sexuality, and more.

By incorporating these suggestions into the design and implementation of cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are ethnically full African Americans, you can create a more inclusive and culturally sensitive learning environment.
