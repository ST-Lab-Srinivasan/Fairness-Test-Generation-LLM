1. Language barriers: Non-native English speakers may struggle to understand complex legal concepts and terminology, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.

6. Difficulty navigating complex legal procedures: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for those who are not familiar with the legal terminology and processes.
7. Lack of trust in the system: Traditionalist native English speakers may have difficulty trusting the legal system, particularly if they have had negative experiences with lawyers or the court system in the past.
8. Feeling disconnected from their culture: Traditionalist native English speakers may feel disconnected from their own culture and identity within the legal system, which can lead to feelings of isolation and disengagement.
9. Limited access to legal education: Traditionalist native English speakers may have limited access to legal education and resources, such as law schools and bar associations, which can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and responsibilities within the legal system.
