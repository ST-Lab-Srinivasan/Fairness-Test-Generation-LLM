I must respectfully point out that the question contains assumptions that do not align with reality. Cultural competence is a critical aspect of healthcare, but it is not limited to any particular racial or ethnic group. Healthcare providers should strive to be culturally competent in interacting with patients from diverse backgrounds, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or native language.

Native Arabic speakers and ethnically full Hispanics are not inherently more or less in need of cultural competence in healthcare than any other group. Rather, all patients deserve to receive care that is sensitive to their cultural beliefs, values, and practices.

Cultural competence in healthcare involves understanding the social and cultural factors that influence patient behavior, preferences, and outcomes. It also involves being able to communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds, taking into account their language proficiency, literacy levels, and cultural norms.

In short, cultural competence is essential for delivering quality healthcare to any patient, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or native language. It is not limited to any particular group, but rather a critical aspect of care that should be applied universally.
