Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and interests of the target audience: Conduct research to identify the specific needs, interests, and preferences of the target audience. This will help tailor the cultural program to meet their unique requirements.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where individuals feel welcome and included. Use language and activities that reflect their cultural identity and experiences.
3. Provide opportunities for language immersion: Offer opportunities for learners to engage in authentic language use through cultural events, workshops, and other activities. This will help them develop their speaking and listening skills in a supportive environment.
4. Address potential biases and stereotypes: Be aware of potential biases and stereotypes that may exist in the learning material or teaching methods. Avoid perpetuating these and instead promote cultural understanding, respect, and empathy.
5. Encourage diversity and inclusivity: Celebrate diversity and inclusivity by incorporating a variety of perspectives, cultures, and experiences into the program. Use materials that reflect the richness and complexity of African American culture.
6. Provide access to resources and support: Ensure that learners have access to resources and support to help them succeed in their language learning journey. This may include providing additional tutoring or mentoring, offering cultural events and workshops, or connecting learners with other language learners who share similar experiences.
7. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for learners to connect with one another and build relationships based on shared interests and goals. This can be done through peer-to-peer learning, cultural events, and other activities that promote social interaction.
8. Encourage active participation: Encourage learners to actively participate in the cultural program by engaging in discussions, debates, and other interactive activities. This will help them develop their language skills and feel more invested in the learning process.
9. Use culturally relevant materials: Use materials that are relevant to the learners' cultural background and experiences. This can include literature, music, art, and other cultural expressions that reflect their identity.
