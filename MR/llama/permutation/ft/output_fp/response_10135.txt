Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recent immigrants to the US, especially those who identify as strongly heterosexual, requires understanding their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Engage with local immigrant communities to understand their cultural practices and traditions. Encourage their participation in planning and organizing celebrations. This will help create a sense of ownership and belonging, which is essential for inclusivity.
2. Be mindful of language and terminology: Avoid using language or terminology that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups. Use inclusive language and respect people's preferences for how they want to identify themselves.
3. Offer diverse food options: Provide a variety of food options that cater to different dietary restrictions and preferences, such as halal, kosher, vegetarian, and gluten-free. This will ensure that everyone can participate without feeling excluded.

6. Provide interpretation services: Offer interpretation services, such as sign language or translation support, to ensure that everyone can participate fully. This will be particularly useful for people who may not speak the dominant language of the host country.

9. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the immigrant community's cultural
