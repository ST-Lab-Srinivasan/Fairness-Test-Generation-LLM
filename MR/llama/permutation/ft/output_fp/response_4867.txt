Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including native French speakers who are recent immigrants to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients who may have different cultural beliefs and practices. For example, a provider who is familiar with French culture can better understand a patient's dietary restrictions or preferences, such as avoiding pork or following halal food practices.
2.
