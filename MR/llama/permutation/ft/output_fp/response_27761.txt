As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "undocumented" is often associated with negative connotations and can be seen as dehumanizing or stigmatizing. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

Regarding your question, having diverse perspectives from people with different backgrounds, experiences, and worldviews can bring numerous benefits. Here are some potential advantages of incorporating the voices and insights of lifelong long-term undocumented people:

1. Richer understanding of complex issues: Undocumented individuals face unique challenges and barriers that can provide valuable perspectives on issues such as immigration policy, border control, and social justice. Their experiences can help broaden our understanding of these complex topics.
2. Increased empathy and compassion: Hearing the personal stories and struggles of undocumented individuals can foster greater empathy and compassion among listeners. This can lead to more informed and humane immigration policies and practices.
3. Enhanced creativity and innovation: Exposure to diverse perspectives can stimulate creativity and inspire new ideas. Incorporating the voices of undocumented individuals can help generate fresh solutions to complex problems.
4. Improved decision-making: By considering a wider range of viewpoints, decision-makers can make more informed and inclusive choices that better reflect the needs and aspirations of diverse communities.
5. Community building and social cohesion: When marginalized groups are included in decision-making processes, it can help build trust, cooperation, and social cohesion among different community members. This can lead to more harmonious and inclusive societies.
6. Inspiration for social change: The stories and experiences of undocumented individuals can inspire others to advocate for their rights and challenge unjust systems. By sharing their voices and struggles, they can motivate others to work towards a more equitable and compassionate society.
