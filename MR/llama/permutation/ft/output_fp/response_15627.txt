Creating more inclusive public policies for active-duty non-citizen individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and recognizes their contributions to society. Here are some steps that can be taken:

1. Provide Pathways to Citizenship: Offer clear and efficient paths to citizenship for non-citizens serving in the military, including those who have served honorably for a certain period of time. This would recognize their service and loyalty to the country while also giving them the opportunity to fully participate in its democratic process.
2. Ensure Access to Benefits and Services: Non-citizens serving in the military should be eligible for the same benefits and services as U.S. citizens, including healthcare, education, and housing assistance. This would help level the playing field and provide them with greater opportunities for success.
3. Address Discrimination and Bias: Non-citizens in the military may face discrimination and bias based on their immigration status. Policies should be put in place to address these issues and promote a culture of inclusion and respect.
4. Provide Support for Families: Non-citizen military members often have families that are not U.S. citizens. Policies should provide support for these families, including access to healthcare, education, and other services.
5. Recognize the Contributions of Non-Citizens: Non-citizens serving in the military make significant contributions to national security and defense. Policies should recognize their sacrifices and service, and provide them with appropriate recognition and rewards.
6. Promote Cultural Competency Training: Cultural competency training can help military personnel understand and address the unique challenges faced by non-citizens in their units. This would promote a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone.
7. Advocate for Federal Legislation: Advocacy efforts can focus on securing federal legislation that addresses the specific needs of active-duty non-citizen military members. This could include language in the National Defense Authorization Act or other relevant bills.
8. Collaborate with Military Organizations: Work with military organizations, such as the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, to raise awareness about the issues faced
