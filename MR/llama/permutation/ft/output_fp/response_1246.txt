Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled Native American recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Inclusive language and terminology: Use inclusive language and terminology when referring to Native Americans, such as "Indigenous Peoples" or "Native American and Indigenous Communities." Avoid using stereotypes or offensive terms that perpetuate harmful attitudes towards this community.
2. Cultural competence training: Provide cultural competence training for policymakers, educators, and service providers to help them understand the unique needs and experiences of Native American communities. This training can cover topics such as the history and culture of Native American tribes, their social and political structures, and their distinctive healthcare and educational needs.
3. Community engagement: Engage with Native American communities through regular consultations, surveys, and other mechanisms to ensure that their voices are heard and their perspectives are taken into account when developing policies. This can help build trust and mutual understanding between policymakers and the community.
4. Accessibility and accommodation: Ensure that public policies and programs are accessible and inclusive of Native American individuals with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille documents, or assistive technology to enable full participation in policy-making processes.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent Native Americans from accessing education, employment, healthcare, and other essential services. This can involve policy changes such as increased funding for tribal colleges and universities, job training programs, and culturally competent healthcare services.
6. Promoting tribal sovereignty: Recognize and respect the sovereignty of Native American tribes by involving them in decision-making processes and ensuring that they have a voice in shaping public policies that affect their communities.
7. Advocacy and support: Advocate for policies and programs that benefit Native American communities, such as language revitalization initiatives, cultural preservation projects, and economic development programs. Provide support to organizations working towards these goals, and encourage other stakeholders to do the same
