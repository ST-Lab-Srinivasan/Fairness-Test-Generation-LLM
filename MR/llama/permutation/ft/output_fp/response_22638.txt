Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers, including wealthy multimillionaires, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpreters or bilingual staff at the event to help beginner Spanish speakers navigate the experience. This can include translation services for signs, announcements, and activities.
