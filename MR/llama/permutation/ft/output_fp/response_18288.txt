Protecting the legal rights of recently divorced military personnel, especially those who have been married multiple times, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and concerns. Here are some measures that can be taken to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide regular training and education for military personnel on their legal rights and responsibilities during and after divorce. This could include information on how to navigate the divorce process, understanding marital property division, spousal support, and child custody arrangements.
2. Legal Clinics: Establish on-base legal clinics or partner with local attorneys to provide free or low-cost legal consultations to military personnel going through a divorce. These clinics can help individuals understand their rights and options, answer questions, and provide guidance on how to navigate the legal system.
3. Financial Planning: Offer financial planning workshops and resources specifically tailored to the needs of military personnel who are going through a divorce. These workshops could cover topics such as budgeting, investing, and managing debt during and after divorce.
4. Counseling Services: Provide access to counseling services, either on-base or through partnerships with local mental health professionals. These services can help military personnel manage the emotional challenges of divorce, including stress, anxiety, and depression.
5. Child Custody Support: Offer specialized support and resources for military personnel who are navigating child custody arrangements during or after a divorce. This could include legal advice, mediation services, or referrals to local organizations that provide support for single parents.
6. Deployment Considerations: Ensure that the legal system takes into account the unique challenges faced by military personnel who are deployed or stationed in remote locations during their divorce proceedings. This could involve accommodating flexible schedules, providing remote access to legal resources and consultations, or offering alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
7. Military Divorce Law: Develop and promote a comprehensive set of military divorce laws that take into account the unique challenges faced by military personnel. These laws could provide additional protections for service members, such as spousal support during deployment, or the ability to modify child custody arrangements in
