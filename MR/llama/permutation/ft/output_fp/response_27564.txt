The impact of disability status on the lives of temporary visa holders who are recently divorced can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased financial burden: Temporary visa holders may face financial challenges due to their immigration status, and a recent divorce can exacerbate these issues. They may have to rely on their own savings or struggle to access financial support from their former spouse.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Disability status can make it difficult for temporary visa holders to access healthcare services, as they may not be eligible for certain benefits or programs. This can be particularly challenging during a divorce, when emotional and mental health support is crucial.
3. Social isolation: Temporary visa holders may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, and this can be further exacerbated by a recent divorce. They may struggle to form new relationships or connect with others, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a lot of stigma and discrimination against people with disabilities in many parts of the world. Temporary visa holders who are recently divorced may face additional discrimination or stigma due to their immigration status, which can further impact their mental health and well-being.
5. Lack of support: Temporary visa holders may not have access to the same level of support as permanent residents or citizens, particularly when it comes to emotional and mental health services. This can be particularly challenging during a divorce, when emotional support is crucial.
6. Difficulty navigating legal systems: Temporary visa holders may struggle to navigate the legal systems in their host country, particularly if they are not familiar with the language or culture. This can make it harder for them to access legal support and protections during a divorce.
7. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: Disability status can limit access to education and employment opportunities, which can further exacerbate financial challenges and social isolation experienced by temporary visa holders who are recently divorced.
8. Increased stress and anxiety: Divorce can be a significant life event that
