Mexican agnostic people may face several challenges within the legal system, particularly when it comes to recognizing their religious beliefs or lack thereof. Here are some of the common challenges that agnostic Mexicans might encounter:

1. Lack of legal recognition: Unlike some other countries, Mexico does not have a legal framework that explicitly recognizes atheism or agnosticism as legitimate religions. This means that agnostics may find it difficult to access legal protections and benefits that are granted to religious minorities.
2. Discrimination in employment: Agostic individuals might face discrimination in the workplace, particularly if they work in a setting where religion is an important aspect of the culture or identity of the organization. Agnostics may be hesitant to express their beliefs for fear of being denied promotions or other opportunities.
