Deep poverty, also known as extreme poverty or multidimensional poverty, refers to a situation where individuals and families lack access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, shelter, clothing, and healthcare. Permanent residents in deep poverty face significant challenges in accessing healthcare services due to various barriers. Here are some of the common challenges faced by deep poverty permanent resident people in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Deep poverty populations often live in remote or rural areas, far from healthcare facilities. They may lack access to basic medical services, including preventive care, due to distance and transportation barriers.
2. Financial barriers: Even if healthcare facilities are available, deep poverty individuals may struggle to pay for services due to a lack of financial resources. High out-of-pocket expenses, co-payments, or deductibles can be prohibitively expensive, making it difficult for them to access necessary care.
3. Lack of health insurance: Many deep poverty individuals do not have health insurance coverage, which can limit their access to medical care. Even if they have insurance, the coverage may be inadequate or unaffordable, leading to financial burdens when seeking care.
4. Language barriers: Individuals with limited English proficiency or those living in areas with limited healthcare resources may face language barriers that hinder their ability to communicate effectively with healthcare providers.
5. Cultural barriers: Deep poverty populations may have cultural beliefs or practices that differ from the mainstream medical community, leading to misunderstandings or mistrust of healthcare services. For example, some communities may have traditional healing practices that they prefer to use instead of modern medicine.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Deep poverty individuals may experience stigma and discrimination when seeking healthcare services due to their socioeconomic status or cultural background. This can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment, making it harder for them to access care.
7. Limited awareness of health issues: Deep poverty populations may have limited knowledge of health issues affecting them due to a lack of access to health education resources. They may also be unaware of available healthcare services or how to access them
