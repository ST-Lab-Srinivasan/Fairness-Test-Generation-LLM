Addressing the needs of mentally disabled Native American natural-born US citizens during disaster responses requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, cultural backgrounds, and access to resources. Here are some key considerations:

1. Inclusive Disaster Planning: Involve organizations serving mentally disabled individuals in disaster planning and response efforts. This can include American Indian Community House (AICH), the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and other organizations that cater to mental health needs.
