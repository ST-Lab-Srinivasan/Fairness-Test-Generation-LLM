Ensuring that the healthcare needs of average income earner Mexican people are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including access, affordability, and quality of care. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Universal Health Coverage (UHC): Mexico could adopt UHC to ensure that everyone has access to essential health services without worrying about financial hardship. UHC would require the creation of a national health insurance program or the expansion of existing ones to cover more people.
2. Public Health Investment: The Mexican government could invest in public health infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and healthcare facilities, to improve access to quality care. This investment could also include training for healthcare professionals and equipping them with modern technology and equipment.
3. Community Health Workers: Mexico could train and deploy community health workers (CHWs) in underserved areas to provide basic healthcare services, such as vaccination programs, disease surveillance, and health education. CHWs can help bridge the gap between formal healthcare services and the needs of marginalized communities.
4. Telemedicine: Mexico could leverage telemedicine services to expand access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas where access to specialist care may be limited. This could involve partnering with private sector providers to offer virtual consultations and remote monitoring services.
5. Health Promotion: The Mexican government could launch public awareness campaigns to promote healthy behaviors and lifestyles, such as regular exercise, balanced diets, and stress management techniques. This could help prevent chronic diseases and reduce healthcare costs in the long run.

7. Addressing Socioeconomic Determinants of Health: Mexico could recognize the interconnection between social determinants of health (such as education, housing, and employment) and health outcomes. By addressing these underlying factors, the country can improve overall population health and reduce healthcare disparities.
8. Training Programs: Mexico could develop
