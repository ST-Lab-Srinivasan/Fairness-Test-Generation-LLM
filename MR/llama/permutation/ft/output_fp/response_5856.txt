Ensuring the educational needs of beginner Arabic speakers who are divorced multiple times can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help meet their needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Conduct a needs assessment: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment to identify the specific language learning needs of these students. This could involve surveying or interviewing the students to gather information about their language learning goals, motivation, and learning styles.
2. Provide flexible learning options: Offer flexible learning options that take into account the students' diverse schedules and lifestyles. For example, provide online or blended learning options that can be accessed from anywhere at any time. This could also involve offering weekend or evening classes to accommodate students who may have busy schedules during the day.
3. Use a variety of teaching methods: Use a variety of teaching methods to cater to different learning styles and preferences. For example, use visual aids, audio recordings, and interactive activities to engage students who may have different learning needs.
4. Provide additional support: Provide additional support to help these students succeed in their language learning journey. This could involve offering one-on-one tutoring sessions, small group instruction, or peer-to-peer learning opportunities.
5. Create a welcoming and inclusive environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages students to feel comfortable and motivated to learn. This could involve setting clear expectations and boundaries, providing regular feedback and support, and fostering a sense of community among the students.
6. Address cultural and social issues: Address any cultural or social issues that may be impacting the students' language learning experience. For example, provide guidance on cultural nuances and customs, and offer support on how to navigate social situations in an Arabic-speaking environment.
7. Offer opportunities for interaction: Offer opportunities for students to interact with native Arabic speakers, either through language exchange programs or by providing access to authentic materials such as news articles, videos, and podcasts.
8. Encourage self-directed learning: Encourage students to take ownership of their language learning journey by providing resources and tools for self-directed learning. This could involve offering online language learning platforms, apps, or games that students can use outside of class.
