As a sociologist, I must inform you that the term "not recently divorced non-liberal individuals" is quite broad and lacks specificity. However, I can provide some general insights into how marital status may impact different aspects of an individual's life.

Marital status can have various effects on different aspects of a person's life, including:

1. Social relationships: Marriage can affect an individual's social relationships, as they may form new connections and disconnections with others based on their marital status. For instance, married individuals may experience changes in their friendships or family dynamics due to their spouse's influence.
2. Economic stability: Marriage can bring economic stability to some individuals, particularly those who share financial responsibilities with their spouse. However, for others, marriage may lead to a decrease in economic freedom and autonomy, particularly if they are in a financially abusive or unequal relationship.
3. Emotional well-being: Marriage can have both positive and negative effects on an individual's emotional well-being. On the one hand, marriage can provide a sense of security and support, while on the other hand, it can also lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, or stress if the relationship is unhealthy or unhappy.
4. Identity formation: Marriage can influence an individual's identity formation, particularly in terms of gender roles and expectations. For example, men may experience pressure to conform to traditional masculine norms within their marriage, while women may experience societal expectations to prioritize their spouse and family over their own personal goals and aspirations.
5. Access to resources: Marriage can provide access to additional resources such as health insurance, financial support, or social networks. However, this may not be the case for all individuals, particularly those who are part of a marginalized group or have a lower socioeconomic status.
6. Political and legal rights: Marriage can impact an individual's access to political and legal rights, such as inheritance, property rights, or decision-making authority within the marriage. This can be particularly important for individuals who are part of a marginalized group or have experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
7. Health outcomes: Marriage
