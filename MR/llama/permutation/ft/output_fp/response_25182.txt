To ensure that the housing needs of non-libertarian Orthodox Jewish individuals are met, it is important to recognize that they may have specific requirements and preferences when it comes to their living arrangements. Here are some steps that can be taken:

1. Understand their needs: It is essential to listen to and understand the housing needs of non-libertarian Orthodox Jewish individuals. This involves engaging in open and respectful dialogue with them, listening to their concerns, and gathering information about their preferences and requirements.

This can involve providing cultural sensitivity training for housing staff, as well as ensuring that the housing environment is welcoming and inclusive of all residents.
5. Foster community: Non-libertarian Orthodox Jewish individuals may place a strong emphasis on community and religious practice. Housing providers can foster this sense of community by organizing events and activities that bring residents together, as well as providing spaces for religious practice and gatherings.

By taking these steps, it is possible to ensure that the housing needs of non-libertarian Orthodox Jewish individuals are met in a way that is respectful and inclusive of their beliefs and practices.
