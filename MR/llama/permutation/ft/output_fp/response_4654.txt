Ensuring that the healthcare needs of low-income people in Mexico are met is a complex challenge that requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Improve access to healthcare: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for low-income individuals is the lack of availability of health facilities in rural areas or the high cost of transportation to urban areas. Governments and NGOs can work together to build more health clinics in rural areas, provide transportation services, or offer telemedicine services to connect patients with healthcare providers.
2. Expand health insurance coverage: Many low-income individuals in Mexico do not have access to health insurance, which can limit their ability to receive preventive care and timely treatment. Governments can establish or expand health insurance programs, such as the Seguro Popular program in Mexico, to provide affordable coverage to more people.
3. Increase investment in public health: Low-income communities often have limited access to basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and hygiene. Governments can increase investment in public health infrastructure and programs to improve the living conditions of these communities.
4. Promote community health workers: Community health workers (CHWs) are trained individuals who work within their communities to promote healthy behaviors and provide basic health services. CHWs can play a crucial role in reaching low-income populations, particularly in rural areas, and can help address the social determinants of health.
5. Foster partnerships between NGOs and government: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often have expertise and resources that can supplement government efforts to address the healthcare needs of low-income populations. Governments can foster partnerships with NGOs to leverage their capabilities and increase the impact of health interventions.
6. Address social determinants of health: Low-income individuals often face a range of social determinants of health, including poverty, poor housing conditions, limited access to education, and inadequate nutrition. Governments can address these issues through policies and programs that promote economic development, improve living conditions, and increase access to education and nutrition.
