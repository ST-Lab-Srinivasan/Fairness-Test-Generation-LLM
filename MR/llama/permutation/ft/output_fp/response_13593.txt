Creating more inclusive social policies for bisexual individuals, particularly those in the 90+ age group, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the existence of bisexuality in older adults: Many older adults may have been closeted or hidden their sexual orientation due to societal stigma, discrimination, or lack of understanding. Recognizing and acknowledging the existence of bisexuality in older adults is crucial for creating more inclusive policies.
2. Conduct research and data collection: Limited data exist on the experiences and needs of bisexual older adults. Conducting research and collecting data can help identify specific challenges and develop targeted interventions. This data can also be used to advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and address the unique needs of this community.
3. Involve bisexual older adults in policy-making: It is essential to involve bisexual older adults in the policy-making process, particularly in the design of services and support systems tailored to their needs. This can help ensure that policies are responsive to their experiences and address the challenges they face.
4. Provide age-appropriate sexual health services: Older adults may experience changes in their sexual health due to aging, such as decreased libido or difficulty with sexual functioning. Providing age-appropriate sexual health services can help address these issues and promote overall well-being.
5. Address social isolation: Many older adults experience social isolation, which can have negative impacts on mental and physical health. Creating opportunities for social connection and community engagement can help mitigate this issue and promote overall well-being.
6. Advocate for legal protections: Older adults may face discrimination based on their sexual orientation, particularly in areas such as housing, employment, and healthcare. Advocating for legal protections against discrimination can help ensure that bisexual older adults are protected from discrimination and have equal access to services and opportunities.
7. Promote cultural competence: Healthcare providers and service providers must be culturally competent in addressing the needs of bisexual older adult
