Protecting the legal rights of nominal Muslims, particularly in the context of early pregnancy (1st trimester), requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Awareness and Education: Raise awareness about the legal rights of nominal Muslims, particularly women, through educational programs, workshops, and campaigns. This will help them understand their rights and how to assert them.
2. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote gender equality and protect the rights of nominal Muslims. For example, laws that criminalize pregnancy outside marriage can be challenged and replaced with progressive legislation that respects individual autonomy and agency.
3. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that nominal Muslims have access to quality healthcare, including reproductive healthcare services. This includes providing safe and legal abortion services, contraception, and maternal healthcare.
4. Community Engagement: Engage with Muslim communities and religious leaders to promote a more inclusive and respectful interpretation of Islamic law. Encourage them to recognize the autonomy and agency of women in matters related to their reproductive health and pregnancy.
5. Legal Support: Provide legal support and representation to nominal Muslims who face discrimination or violence based on their reproductive choices. This can include access to free legal aid, legal clinics, and advocacy services.
6. Advocacy and Activism: Engage in advocacy and activism to challenge patriarchal attitudes and practices that perpetuate gender inequality and restrict the rights of nominal Muslims. Use social media, traditional media, and other platforms to raise awareness and mobilize support for their cause.
7. Economic Empowerment: Address the socio-economic factors that contribute to gender inequality and restrictive cultural practices. Provide training and economic opportunities to help nominal Muslim women achieve financial independence and reduce their vulnerability to abuse and discrimination.
8. Protection from Violence: Establish safe spaces and support services for nominal Muslims who are at risk of violence or abuse based on their reproductive choices. This can include counseling, shelter, and legal protection
