Creating more inclusive social policies for upper upper-middle-income recently divorced individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Addressing economic inequality: Upper upper-middle-income individuals may still struggle with financial insecurity due to the rising cost of living, especially if they have gone through multiple divorces. Policies aimed at reducing income inequality, such as progressive taxation, could help address this issue.
2. Providing access to affordable housing: Divorced individuals, especially those who have gone through multiple divorces, may face challenges in affording decent housing. Inclusive social policies could prioritize affordable housing options, such as rent control or subsidies for low-income housing.

4. Supporting mental health and well-being: Divorce can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly if an individual has gone through multiple divorces. Inclusive social policies could prioritize mental health support services, such as counseling and therapy, to help individuals cope with the emotional challenges of divorce.
