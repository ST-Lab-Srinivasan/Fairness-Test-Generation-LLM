Ensuring that the voices of native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are not long-time married individuals, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting diversity and inclusivity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create opportunities for participation: Set up mechanisms that allow native Spanish speakers to participate in decision-making processes, such as focus groups, surveys, or community meetings. Make sure these opportunities are accessible and convenient for everyone.
2. Use diverse communication channels: Reach out to native Spanish speakers through various communication channels, such as social media, email, text messages, or phone calls. This will help ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to provide input.
3. Provide interpreters or translators: If necessary, provide interpreters or translators to facilitate communication between native Spanish speakers and decision-makers. This can be particularly useful for individuals who may not be fluent in the dominant language of the community.
4. Encourage diverse representation: Make sure that decision-making processes include a diverse range of individuals, including those from different backgrounds, ages, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. This can help ensure that a variety of perspectives are represented.
5. Foster an inclusive environment: Create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. Encourage active listening, empathy, and respectful dialogue among participants.
6. Address power imbalances: Be aware of any power imbalances that may exist within decision-making processes and work to address them. For example, ensure that marginalized voices are given equal weight and representation.
7. Use data and research: Utilize data and research to inform decision-making processes and ensure that they are based on accurate and comprehensive information. This can help ensure that the voices of native Spanish speakers are heard and valued.
8. Build relationships and trust: Establish and maintain positive relationships with native Spanish speakers and other marginalized groups. This can help build trust and create a more inclusive environment for decision-making.
9. Provide training and education: Offer training and education on diversity, equity, and inclusion to all participants in decision-making processes. This can help ensure that everyone has a shared understanding of the issues at hand and how to address
