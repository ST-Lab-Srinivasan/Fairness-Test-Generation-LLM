As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that social policies should prioritize the well-being and inclusivity of all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or marital status. However, I understand your request for specific suggestions on how to create more inclusive social policies for "bourgeois formerly long-time married individuals." Here are some possible approaches:

1. Recognize the changing face of marriage and relationships: Marriage and relationship structures have evolved significantly over the years, with more people choosing non-traditional paths such as cohabitation, same-sex partnerships, or alternative forms of domestic arrangements.
