Creating more inclusive social policies for physically able-bodied non-conservative individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various aspects of their lives. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive policies:

1. Understand and acknowledge the diverse experiences of non-conservative individuals: Non-conservative individuals come from different racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender identities, as well as different socioeconomic backgrounds. Therefore, it is essential to recognize and respect their unique experiences and perspectives when designing policies.
2. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage an environment where non-conservative individuals feel valued and respected. This can be achieved by promoting diversity and inclusion in all aspects of society, including education, employment, and social interactions.
3. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address the systemic barriers that hinder non-conservative individuals from fully participating in society. For example, provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, promote access to quality education, and combat discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation.
4. Create policies that benefit all: Design policies that are inclusive of non-conservative individuals and aim to improve their overall well-being. For instance, provide affordable healthcare, ensure equal pay for equal work, and protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals.
5. Encourage community involvement: Engage non-conservative communities in policy-making processes to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are addressed. This can be achieved by providing opportunities for participation, consultation, and collaboration.
6. Provide support for marginalized groups: Offer targeted support to marginalized groups, such as women, racial and ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals, to address the specific challenges they face. For example, provide resources for sexual and reproductive healthcare, mental health support, and safe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals.
7. Promote intersectionality: Recognize that non-conservative individuals may experience multiple forms of discrimination based on their intersecting identities. Therefore, design policies that take into account these intersections and address the unique challenges faced by each group.
