Native American cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native natural-born US citizens, including moderate individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices passed down from generation to generation within a particular group or community. For Native Americans, their cultural heritage is deeply connected to their history, traditions, and relationships with the land and natural world.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of Native moderate individuals:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a larger community and a connection to one's ancestors and history. For many Native Americans, their cultural heritage is an important aspect of their identity and helps them feel connected to their community and ancestral lands.
2. Value system: Native American cultural heritage is guided by a set of values that prioritize reciprocity, respect, and balance. These values shape the way moderate individuals think about their relationships with others and the natural world. For example, the concept of "mitakuye oyasin" (all my relations) emphasizes the interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of treating others with respect and compassion.
3. Spirituality: Many Native Americans have a deep spiritual connection to their ancestors, land, and natural world. This spirituality shapes their relationship with the world around them and informs their decision-making processes. For example, some Native American tribes have traditional ceremonies and rituals that are intended to honor the spirits of the land and ancestors, which can influence moderate individuals' beliefs and practices.

This history of resilience and adaptation has contributed to the strength and resilience of many Native Americans, which can be an important aspect of their identity as moderate individuals.

This political engagement is often rooted in a sense of responsibility to their communities and a desire to preserve their cultural heritage for future generations. Moderate individuals may be inspired by this commitment to activism and social justice.
