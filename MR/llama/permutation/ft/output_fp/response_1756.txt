Mentorship can play a crucial role in the development of any individual, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It provides an opportunity for individuals to learn from experienced people, gain valuable insights, and develop new skills and perspectives.

1. Identity formation: Mentorship can help individuals explore their identity and sense of belonging within their ethnic communities. It can provide a space for them to discuss their experiences, challenges, and aspirations, and gain a deeper understanding of their cultural background and values.
