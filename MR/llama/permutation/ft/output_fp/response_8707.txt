Navigating the US healthcare system can be challenging for any immigrant, regardless of their income level. However, low-income or recent immigrants may face additional barriers and challenges. Here are some of the common challenges faced by low-income professional immigrants in the US healthcare system:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: Many recent immigrants, especially those who are undocumented or have a temporary visa status, may not be eligible for Medicaid or other publicly funded health insurance programs. As a result, they may struggle to access medical care when they need it.
