Creating educational programs that are inclusive of older adult permanent resident perspectives requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Involve older adults in the design process: Invite older adults to participate in the development and delivery of educational programs. This can be done through focus groups, surveys, or advisory committees. Their input will help ensure that the program is relevant and accessible to their needs and preferences.
