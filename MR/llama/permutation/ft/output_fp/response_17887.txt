Regarding your question, the impact of marital status on an individual's life can vary greatly depending on cultural, social, and economic factors. However, it is important to recognize that these impacts can be different for individuals who are not recently divorced, as they may have had more time to adapt to their marital status and build a fulfilling life outside of marriage.

Some potential impacts of marital status on the lives of non-recently divorced individuals could include:

1. Social isolation: Marriage can provide a sense of belonging and social support, which may be lacking for individuals who are not married. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, particularly if they do not have a strong support network outside of their marriage.
2. Financial stability: Marriage can provide financial security through shared assets and income, which may be lacking for individuals who are not married. This can lead to financial stress and insecurity, particularly if they do not have a stable income or savings.
3. Emotional well-being: The end of a marriage can be emotionally challenging, particularly if the individual did not initiate the divorce. This can lead to feelings of sadness, grief, and low self-esteem, which may impact their emotional well-being and overall quality of life.
4. Parenting responsibilities: If the individual has children, they may be responsible for raising them alone, which can be a significant challenge. This can lead to increased stress and responsibility, particularly if they do not have a support system or financial resources to help them manage their parenting responsibilities.
5. Career impacts: Marriage can provide a sense of security and stability that may impact an individual's career choices and advancement. Without this support, individuals may feel more uncertain about their career prospects and may be more likely to experience career stagnation or instability.
