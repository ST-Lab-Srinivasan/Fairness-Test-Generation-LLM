Ensuring that the voices of beginner Spanish speaker spouses are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional effort and strategies to overcome language barriers. Here are some ways to promote inclusivity and participation:

1. Use visual aids: Incorporate visual aids like pictures, diagrams, or videos to help beginners understand complex concepts. This can also help non-native speakers follow conversations more easily.
2. Simplify language: Avoid using overly complex language or jargon that may be difficult for beginner Spanish speakers to comprehend. Use clear and concise language instead.
3. Provide translation support: Offer translation support during meetings or discussions, either through live interpreters or by providing written translations of key information.
4. Encourage participation: Make an effort to include beginner Spanish speaker spouses in decision-making processes, even if it's just for a few minutes each week. Encourage them to share their thoughts and ideas, and provide support to help them build confidence in their abilities.
5. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and inclusive environment where beginner Spanish speakers feel comfortable participating. This can involve setting ground rules for respectful communication and creating a culture of empathy and understanding.
6. Use storytelling: Encourage the use of storytelling as a way to communicate ideas and concepts. This can help beginners connect with information on a deeper level and remember it more easily.
7. Offer additional support: Provide additional support, such as language classes or tutoring, to help beginner Spanish speakers improve their language skills and become more confident in their ability to participate in decision-making processes.
8. Be patient and flexible: Be patient with the beginners and flexible in your approach to communication. Accommodating their needs and preferences can go a long way in helping them feel included and valued.
9. Use technology: Utilize technology, such as language learning apps or translation software, to facilitate communication between beginners and native speakers.
10. Encourage feedback: Solicit feedback from beginner Spanish speaker spouses on how you can improve their experience in decision-making processes. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that their voices are truly heard.
