The impact of military status on the lives of non-liberal and non-upper middle-income individuals can be significant, as they may face unique challenges and limitations compared to those in more affluent positions. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: In many countries, the military is seen as a path for advancement and better economic prospects. However, for non-liberal and non-upper middle-income individuals, accessing these opportunities may be difficult due to financial constraints or limited access to educational resources.
