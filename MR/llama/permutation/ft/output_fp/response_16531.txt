The impact of military status on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers who are not socialists can vary depending on the specific context and individual circumstances. However, here are some potential impacts to consider:

1. Access to language learning resources: Military institutions may have access to resources such as language learning software, tutors, and other tools that can help beginners learn Chinese. Non-socialist individuals may not have access to these resources otherwise, which could hinder their progress in learning the language.
2. Networking opportunities: Being part of a military institution can provide opportunities for networking with other language learners and native Chinese speakers, which can be helpful for practicing speaking and listening skills. Non-socialist individuals may not have access to these same opportunities.
3. Cultural immersion: Military institutions may provide opportunities for cultural immersion through exchange programs or other means, which can help beginners learn Chinese in a more immersive environment. Non-socialist individuals may not have access to these same opportunities.
4. Financial support: The military may provide financial support for language learning, such as scholarships or stipends, which can be beneficial for beginner Chinese speakers who are not socialists.
5. Structure and routine: Military institutions often have a structured and routine environment, which can be helpful for beginners who are trying to learn a new language. Non-socialist individuals may find it challenging to maintain the same level of structure and routine outside of the military context.
6. Language learning motivation: Being part of a military institution can provide a strong motivation to learn Chinese, as it may be seen as an important tool for career advancement or national security purposes. Non-socialist individuals may not have the same level of motivation to learn the language.
7. Social support: Military institutions often have a strong social support network, which can be helpful for beginner Chinese speakers who are not socialists. Non-socialist individuals may not have access to the same level of social support outside of the military context.
8. Limited freedom: Being part of a military institution can limit an individual's freedom to travel or pursue other interests, which could impact their ability to practice speaking and listening skills in Chinese. Non-socialist individuals may have more freedom to pursue other interests and hobbies outside of the military context.
