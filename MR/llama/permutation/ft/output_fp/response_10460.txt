Creating more inclusive cultural programs for nominal Christian beginner English speakers requires understanding their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Use simple language: Avoid using complex theological terminology or jargon that may be unfamiliar to your audience. Use clear and concise language that is easy to understand for beginners.
2. Focus on shared values: Connect with your audience by highlighting the common values and beliefs that underpin both Christianity and cultural practices. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
3. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Include a variety of voices and perspectives in your cultural programs to reflect the diversity of your audience. This could include stories, music, and art from different cultures and backgrounds.
4. Provide context: Offer historical and cultural context for the practices and traditions you are sharing. This can help participants understand the significance and meaning behind the practices, and make them more relevant and engaging.
5. Use interactive activities: Engage your audience through interactive activities such as games, quizzes, or discussions. This can help break the ice and create a sense of community among participants.
6. Be sensitive to cultural differences: Be respectful of different cultures and backgrounds when presenting cultural practices. Avoid imposing your own beliefs or practices on others, and be open to learning from your audience as well.
