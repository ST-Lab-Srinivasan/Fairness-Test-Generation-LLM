Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Native and Recent Immigrant Ultra-Liberals in the US

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native and recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who identify as ultra-liberal. This group's cultural background and experiences of migration can influence their worldview, values, and political beliefs. In this essay, we will explore how cultural heritage shapes the identities of these individuals and how it impacts their political views.

I. Cultural Heritage and Identity Formation
A. Native Americans
Native Americans have a unique cultural heritage that is deeply rooted in their history, traditions, and beliefs. Their cultural identity is shaped by their connection to the land, their spiritual practices, and their communal way of life. These cultural practices and beliefs have been passed down through generations, creating a strong sense of community and shared identity among Native Americans.

B. Recent Immigrants
Recent immigrants to the US bring with them their own cultural heritage, which is often shaped by their country of origin, religion, and social and political experiences. Their cultural background can influence their language, cuisine, music, and other aspects of their identity. However, recent immigrants may also experience cultural shock and assimilation as they adapt to life in the US.

II. The Impact of Cultural Heritage on Political Views
A. Shared Values
Both Native Americans and recent immigrants often share similar values such as social justice, equality, and community. These shared values are shaped by their cultural heritage and experiences of marginalization or oppression. As a result, they tend to identify with political ideologies that align with these values, such as ultra-liberalism.

B. Cultural Practices and Political Engagement
Cultural practices and traditions can also influence an individual's political engagement. For example, many Native Americans have a deep connection to the land and natural world, which may inspire them to advocate for environmental protection and conservation policies. Similarly, recent immigrants may bring with them cultural practices that emphasize collectivism and community involvement, leading them to participate in social justice movements and political activism.
