Promoting the educational success of immigrant students, including those who have recently immigrated to the US, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some strategies that educators and administrators can consider:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for teachers and staff on cultural competency and how to support students from diverse backgrounds. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming learning environment.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services, such as English as a Second Language (ESL) classes or bilingual education programs, to help non-liberal immigrant students improve their language proficiency.
3. Academic Support: Provide academic support services, such as tutoring or mentoring, to help students who may be struggling academically due to the language barrier or cultural differences.
4. Social Integration: Encourage social integration by organizing events and activities that bring together students from different cultural backgrounds. This can help build a sense of community and belonging among students.
5. Family Engagement: Involve parents and families in their children's education through workshops, meetings, or other activities that provide information and support on how to navigate the US education system.
6. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with local organizations and community groups that can provide additional support services for immigrant students, such as legal aid, health services, or job training programs.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that support the educational success of immigrant students, such as providing in-state tuition rates for undocumented students or opposing discriminatory legislation that can hinder their academic progress.
8. Access to Technology: Provide access to technology, such as laptops or tablets, to help students who may not have access to these resources at home. This can help bridge the digital divide and provide equal opportunities for learning.
9. Career Guidance: Offer career guidance and counseling services to help immigrant students explore their career options and make informed decisions about their future.
10. Celebrating Diversity: Celebrate the diverse cultures and backgrounds of immigrant students by organizing cultural events, exhibitions, or performances that showcase their heritage.
