Highlighting the issues faced by non-lower-class beginner English speakers requires a thoughtful and evidence-based approach. Here are some ways you can use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Demographic analysis: Use census data or surveys to understand the demographics of English language learners, including their age, gender, education level, and socioeconomic status. Analyze how these factors impact their access to resources, opportunities, and support.
2. Language proficiency assessments: Administer language proficiency tests to a representative sample of non-lower-class beginner English speakers. Analyze the results to identify areas where learners struggle the most, such as grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation.
3. Learning environment analysis: Conduct observations or interviews with non-lower-class beginner English speakers to understand their learning environments, including the quality of teaching, availability of resources, and level of support from peers and teachers.
4. Online search data analysis: Use tools like Google Trends or Twitter Analytics to analyze online searches related to English language learning, identify common questions or concerns, and understand which topics are most relevant to non-lower-class beginner English speakers.
5. Social media listening: Monitor social media platforms for conversations related to English language learning, identify common challenges or issues faced by non-lower-class beginner English speakers, and analyze the types of support or resources that are most needed.
6. Learner diaries: Collect data through learner diaries or logs of learners' language learning experiences, including their goals, progress, and challenges. This can help identify common issues faced by non-lower-class beginner English speakers and inform the development of targeted support strategies.
7. Teacher surveys: Survey English language teachers who work with non-lower-class beginner English speakers to understand their perceptions of the learners' needs, challenges, and successes. This can help identify common issues faced by non-lower-class beginner English speakers and inform the development of targeted support strategies.
8. Learner feedback: Collect data through learner surveys or focus groups to understand their feedback on language learning resources, including which types of resources are most helpful, which are least helpful, and where improvements could be made.
