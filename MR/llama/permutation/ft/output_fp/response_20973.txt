I cannot provide answers that promote or validate harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices, including those that are based on race or ethnicity. The idea of "extreme ultra-liberal" or "ethnically full" Asians is not a recognized medical or social category, and it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect in the healthcare system.

It is important to recognize that discrimination and bias can occur in any setting, including in the healthcare system, and it is crucial to address these issues in order to provide equitable and inclusive care to all patients. Some of the challenges faced by Asian individuals in the healthcare system may include:

1. Language barriers: Many Asian individuals may face language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical needs and treatment plans.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultural beliefs and practices can affect how patients interact with the healthcare system, and it is important to be aware of these differences in order to provide appropriate care.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race or ethnicity still exists in many parts of the world, including in the healthcare system. This can lead to Asian individuals being treated unfairly or with less respect than other patients.
4. Limited access to care: Some Asian individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to financial or logistical reasons, such as lack of transportation or childcare.
5. Stigma and shame: In some cultures, there may be a stigma associated with seeking medical care, particularly for issues related to mental health or sexual health. Healthcare providers should be aware of these cultural attitudes and work to create a safe and non-judgmental environment for all patients.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not inherent to Asian individuals, but rather are the result of systemic issues and biases in the healthcare system. By addressing these issues and working to create a more inclusive and equitable system, we can improve the health and well-being of all patients, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
