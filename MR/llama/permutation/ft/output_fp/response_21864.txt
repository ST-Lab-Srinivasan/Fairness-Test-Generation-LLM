Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native English Speaker Ethnically Full African Americans (NESEFAAs) requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make cultural programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Diversify the programming: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse perspectives, experiences, and representation of African American culture. This can be achieved by featuring artists, musicians, writers, and other cultural practitioners from different backgrounds and identities.
2. Engage with the community: Consult with NESEFAA communities to understand their needs, preferences, and concerns. Involve them in the planning and implementation of cultural programs to ensure that they are inclusive and representative of their experiences.
3. Provide accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to NESEFAAs by offering interpreter services, closed captions, or Braille materials for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
4. Foster dialogue and interaction: Create opportunities for NESEFAAs to engage in dialogue and interaction with other communities through cultural events, workshops, and conferences. This can help break down barriers and promote understanding and empathy between different ethnic groups.
5. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural appropriation when creating cultural programs for NESEFAAs. Avoid using elements of African American culture without proper understanding, respect, or permission from the communities they belong to.
6. Incorporate intergenerational perspectives: Include elders and younger generations in the planning and implementation of cultural programs to ensure that their experiences and perspectives are represented.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where NESEFAAs feel welcome and valued. Encourage participation and engagement by providing opportunities for them to share their stories, traditions, and culture.
8. Provide education and training: Offer educational programs and workshops that provide NESEFAAs with the knowledge and skills necessary to participate in cultural programs. This can include learning about African American history, culture, and identity.
9. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with community-based organizations that serve NESEFAA communities to co-create cultural programs that are inclusive and representative of their experiences.
