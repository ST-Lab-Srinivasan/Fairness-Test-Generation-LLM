As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that the term "Arabic speaker Mexican people" is not a valid or accurate category. Arabic is a language spoken in many parts of the world, including the Middle East and North Africa, while Mexico is a country located in North America. Therefore, it is unlikely that there would be a significant number of individuals who identify as both Arabic speakers and Mexican.

However, I understand your question to be referring to the challenges faced by Mexican immigrants or individuals with Middle Eastern descent who may be learning Arabic as a second language in the healthcare system. Here are some potential challenges that they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: One of the most significant challenges faced by non-native speakers of Arabic in the healthcare system is the language barrier. Limited proficiency in Arabic can make it difficult for patients to communicate their medical needs and concerns to healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
2. Cultural differences: Arabic-speaking patients may have different cultural beliefs and practices than their healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts. For example, some Middle Eastern cultures may have specific beliefs about end-of-life care that may be unfamiliar to healthcare providers.

This can make it difficult for patients to receive adequate medical care and communicate with their healthcare providers.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, Arabic-speaking individuals may face bias and discrimination in the healthcare system, particularly in light of current political climate. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and difficulties accessing medical care.
5. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Non-native speakers of Arabic may find it challenging to navigate the healthcare system, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the language and cultural norms of the country they are living in. This can lead to difficulties accessing medical care, filling prescriptions, or understanding insurance options.
6. Limited access to culturally competent healthcare providers: Arabic-speaking
