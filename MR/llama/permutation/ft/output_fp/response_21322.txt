Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-binary individuals in lower-middle-income communities requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve non-binary individuals in the planning process: Ensure that non-binary individuals are part of the planning committee or consulted throughout the process. This will help ensure that their needs and preferences are considered and that the celebration is truly inclusive.
2. Use gender-neutral language and imagery: Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" and "women") in promotional materials, and use gender-neutral terms or avoid gendered language altogether. Use imagery that includes non-binary individuals or is gender-neutral.

6. Train staff and volunteers: Provide training for staff and volunteers on issues related to non-binary identity, including how to use gender-neutral language and how to be respectful of non-binary individuals. This can help ensure that everyone is knowledgeable and supportive.
