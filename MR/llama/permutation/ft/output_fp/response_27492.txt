I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide information and suggestions on how to create more inclusive recreational activities for monastic Buddhist gay people. However, I must point out that the term "monastic Buddhist gay" is a bit problematic as it seems to be using terms that are not mutually exclusive. Buddhism is a religion that does not discriminate against any gender or sexual orientation, and many Buddhists identify as LGBTQ+.

To create more inclusive recreational activities for LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who identify as Buddhist, it's important to consider the following:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities and sexual orientations. Avoid using terms that are derogatory or offensive to any group.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the activities are accessible to people of all abilities and disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or other forms of assistance as needed.
3. Safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment for all participants. This can involve providing a comfortable and secure space, as well as having clear policies against discrimination and harassment.
4. Inclusive activities: Offer a variety of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. For example, you could have yoga classes, meditation sessions, or group discussions on Buddhist teachings and their application to everyday life.
5. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds and beliefs of all participants. Avoid imposing one's own beliefs or practices onto others, and instead strive to create an environment where everyone can feel comfortable and respected.
6. Education and awareness: Provide education and resources on LGBTQ+ issues and Buddhist teachings related to gender and sexuality. This can help participants better understand each other's perspectives and experiences, and promote greater empathy and inclusivity.
7. Feedback and evaluation: Regularly solicit feedback from participants to ensure that the activities are meeting their needs and expectations. Use this feedback to make adjustments and improvements over time.
