Creating more inclusive community programs for native Chinese speakers who are not long-time married individuals requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to help you design such programs:

1. Understand the target audience: Conduct research to identify the specific needs, interests, and preferences of this demographic group. This will help you tailor your program offerings and marketing strategies to effectively reach and engage them.
2. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences, such as language classes, cultural events, social gatherings, and volunteer opportunities. This will help ensure that there is something for everyone, regardless of their age, marital status, or other factors.
3. Foster an inclusive atmosphere: Create a welcoming environment where individuals feel comfortable and included. This can be achieved by promoting cross-cultural understanding, encouraging participation from all members, and providing opportunities for social interaction.
4. Provide childcare support: Many native Chinese speakers may have young children who are not yet in school. Offering childcare services or activities specifically designed for families can help attract this demographic group and create a more inclusive environment.
5. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with other community groups, schools, or businesses to reach a wider audience and offer complementary programs and services. This can help leverage resources and expertise to create a more comprehensive and inclusive program.
6. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many individuals in this demographic group may have busy schedules or conflicting commitments. Providing flexible scheduling options, such as evening or weekend programs, can help accommodate their needs and increase participation.
7. Utilize digital platforms: Utilize social media, online forums, or other digital platforms to reach a wider audience and provide convenient access to program information and registration. This can help attract individuals who may not have previously been reached by traditional community programs.
8. Involve the community in program development: Encourage feedback and input from native Chinese speakers and other members of the community to ensure that your programs are responsive to their needs and preferences. This can help build trust and engagement within the community.
9. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Offer training or workshops
