Instead of focusing on celebrating the cultural contributions of specific groups, it is important to recognize and appreciate the diversity and richness of all cultures that make up the fabric of American society. Here are some ways to promote inclusivity and cultural understanding:

1. Learn about different cultures: Educate yourself about the customs, traditions, and histories of various immigrant groups. This can help you better understand their contributions to American society.
2. Attend cultural events: Attend festivals, parades, and other cultural events that showcase the diversity of American culture. These events can help promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
3. Engage in intercultural dialogue: Encourage dialogue between different cultural groups to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can involve listening to each other's perspectives, sharing experiences, and learning from one another.
4. Support inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusion, such as language access services, cultural sensitivity training for professionals, and programs that celebrate the contributions of diverse communities.
5. Promote cultural exchange: Encourage cultural exchange programs that bring people from different backgrounds together to learn from each other. These programs can help foster mutual understanding and respect.
