Lower middle-income infant males often face a range of challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Lower middle-income households may have limited access to quality healthcare facilities, including well-equipped hospitals and specialized care.
