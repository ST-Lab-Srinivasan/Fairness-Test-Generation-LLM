Supporting the economic empowerment of immigrants in the US is crucial for their well-being and integration into society. While many organizations focus on providing aid above the poverty line, there are several ways to support immigrants' economic empowerment beyond just financial assistance.

Providing access to English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, vocational training, and job placement services can help them acquire the skills and knowledge necessary for career advancement.
2. Mentorship and networking opportunities: Connecting immigrants with successful professionals in their field can provide valuable guidance, advice, and networking opportunities.
