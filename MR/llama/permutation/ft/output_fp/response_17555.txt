To highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish and French speakers, we can use data from various sources such as language learning apps, survey research, or linguistic studies. Here are some ways to analyze and present the data:

1. Language learning app usage: Analyze data from language learning apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to understand how many users are starting at the beginner level, how many are progressing through the levels, and how many are dropping out. This can help identify common challenges faced by beginner learners.
2. Survey research: Conduct surveys among language learners to gather information on their motivation, goals, and challenges. The survey could ask questions such as "What motivated you to start learning Spanish/French?", "What are your goals for speaking the language?", "What difficulties have you encountered so far?" etc.
3. Linguistic studies: Analyze linguistic data from academic studies or research papers to identify patterns and trends in the way beginner learners progress in their language learning journey. For example, studies have shown that beginner learners often struggle with the correct use of verb conjugation, noun gender, and sentence structure in Spanish and French.

5. User feedback: Collect feedback from language learners on how they found certain aspects of learning Spanish/French difficult. This can help identify common challenges and areas where beginner learners need more support.
6. Social media analytics: Analyze social media data to understand how beginner learners interact with each other and the language learning community. For example, you could analyze Twitter hashtags related to language learning or Instagram posts about language learning challenges.
7. Language proficiency levels: Analyze data on the proficiency levels of beginner learners in Spanish/French. This can help identify areas where beginner learners need more support and resources.
8. Learning styles: Analyze data on how beginner learners prefer to learn languages, such as through multimedia content, language exchange programs, or immersion experiences.
9. Age and gender: Analy
