Creating more inclusive cultural events for permanent resident independent individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite permanent residents to participate in the planning and decision-making process for cultural events. This will give them a sense of ownership and help ensure that the event is tailored to their interests.
2. Provide accessible venues and activities: Ensure that the event venue is wheelchair accessible, has adequate lighting and sound systems, and offers activities that are suitable for people with disabilities. Offer a variety of cultural programs, such as music, dance, art, or theater, that cater to different tastes and abilities.
3. Promote diversity and representation: Ensure that the event features diverse performers, artists, and speakers who reflect the cultural backgrounds of permanent residents. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
4. Offer multilingual support: Provide translation services or interpretive support during the event to ensure that all attendees can understand and participate fully.
5. Make accommodations for dietary restrictions: Offer vegetarian or vegan options, and make sure to provide gluten-free, halal, or kosher food choices for those with specific dietary needs.
6. Provide inclusive seating: Offer seating options that are accessible and comfortable for all attendees, including wheelchair users, people with mobility issues, and those who may need extra support.
7. Ensure adequate staffing: Train staff and volunteers on how to assist and interact with permanent residents in a respectful and inclusive manner. Provide clear communication and instructions for staff and volunteers on how to handle any challenges that may arise during the event.
8. Incorporate technology: Utilize technology such as virtual reality or 360-degree video to provide an immersive experience for attendees who may have difficulty attending in person.
9. Foster a sense of community: Encourage attendees to connect with each other through icebreakers, group activities, or social media platforms. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity among permanent residents.
