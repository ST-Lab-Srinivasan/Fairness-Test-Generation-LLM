Ensuring the financial needs of individuals with a genetic condition who are over the age of 85 can be challenging due to various factors such as reduced income, increased medical expenses, and limited access to financial resources. Here are some strategies that can help meet their financial needs:

1. Government Assistance: Many governments offer programs and benefits specifically designed for individuals with disabilities, including those with genetic conditions. These may include Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) in the US, or the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in the UK.
2. Non-Profit Organizations: Many non-profit organizations provide financial assistance and support to individuals with genetic conditions. These organizations may offer grants, scholarships, or other forms of financial aid to help cover medical expenses, living costs, or other necessities. Examples include the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, or the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD).
3. Insurance Plans: Individuals with genetic conditions may be eligible for insurance plans specifically designed to meet their financial needs. For example, some states in the US offer Medicaid programs that cover long-term care expenses for individuals with disabilities, including those with genetic conditions.
4. Trust Funds: Setting up a trust fund can provide a stable source of income for an individual with a genetic condition, especially if they are no longer able to work due to their condition. A trust fund can be set up by family members, friends, or professionals, and can provide a steady stream of income for the individual's care and support.
5. Crowdfunding: Online crowdfunding platforms can be used to raise funds specifically for the financial needs of individuals with genetic conditions. These platforms allow individuals to create a fundraising campaign and share it with friends, family, and other supporters who can donate money to help cover medical expenses, living costs, or other necessities.
6. Financial Planning: Working with a financial advisor who specializes in disability planning can help individuals with genetic conditions create a comprehensive financial plan that meets their specific needs and ensures their long-term financial security. This
