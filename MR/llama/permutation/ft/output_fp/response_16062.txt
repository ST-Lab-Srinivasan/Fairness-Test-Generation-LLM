Temporary visa holders with a genetic condition may face several challenges in the job market, including:

1. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on health status is still prevalent in many countries, and temporary visa holders with a genetic condition may be at risk of being denied employment or facing discrimination in the workplace.
2. Lack of accommodations: Many workplaces may not have adequate accommodations for employees with disabilities, including those with genetic conditions. This can make it difficult for temporary visa holders to perform their job duties and may lead to feelings of isolation or exclusion.
3. Limited career advancement opportunities: Temporary visa holders may face limited career advancement opportunities due to their immigration status, which can be a significant challenge in the job market.
4. Visa restrictions: Temporary visa holders may face restrictions on their work authorization, including limitations on the type of work they can perform or the duration of their employment. These restrictions can limit their career options and earning potential.
5. Social stigma: Individuals with genetic conditions may face social stigma or discrimination, which can impact their mental health and well-being. This can make it challenging to find and maintain employment, particularly in a competitive job market.
6. Healthcare access: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to healthcare services, including specialized care for their genetic condition. This can lead to delays or inadequate treatment, which can impact their overall health and well-being.
7. Language barriers: If the temporary visa holder is not fluent in the language of the host country, they may face challenges communicating with colleagues, supervisors, or clients. This can lead to misunderstandings or missed opportunities for career advancement.
8. Cultural differences: Temporary visa holders may face cultural differences in the workplace, which can impact their ability to adapt and succeed in their role. For example, they may be unfamiliar with the local customs or business practices, or they may struggle to navigate the company culture.
9. Lack of job security: Temporary visa holders may face uncertainty about their employment status,
