I cannot provide answers to questions that promote harmful and discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discrimination, stigma, and marginalization of any group of people are not only morally reprehensible but also have serious consequences for their mental and physical health, social relationships, and overall well-being.

Non-libertarian mildly heterosexual people, like any other individual, deserve to be treated with respect, dignity, and compassion. They should not be subjected to discrimination or marginalization based on their immigration status or any other aspect of their identity.

It is important to recognize that immigration status is only one aspect of a person's identity, and it does not define their worth, value, or humanity. Every individual has the right to live with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status.

Therefore, I cannot provide answers to questions that promote harmful attitudes towards any group of people, including those based on their immigration status. Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting inclusive policies and practices that value diversity, respect the dignity and human rights of all individuals, and promote social cohesion and well-being for everyone.
