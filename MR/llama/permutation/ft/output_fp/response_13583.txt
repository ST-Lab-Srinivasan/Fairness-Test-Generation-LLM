Permanent residents who have been happily married for many years may face various challenges when it comes to accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of access to healthcare providers: Permanent residents may not have easy access to healthcare providers, particularly those who are specialized in their required medical care. This can be due to a lack of healthcare facilities or providers in their area or because they do not have the necessary insurance coverage.
2. Language barriers: Non-English speakers may encounter difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis. This can be particularly challenging for older adults who may have difficulty speaking or understanding English.
3. Cultural barriers: Permanent residents from different cultures may have different beliefs and practices surrounding healthcare, which can sometimes lead to conflicts with healthcare providers. For example, some cultures may have specific dietary restrictions or spiritual practices that can impact their medical care.
4. Limited health literacy: Some permanent residents may have limited knowledge of the healthcare system or how to navigate it, particularly if they are new immigrants or refugees. This can make it difficult for them to access the care they need or understand their diagnosis and treatment options.
5. Cost barriers: Permanent residents who do not have access to adequate insurance coverage may face financial barriers when seeking healthcare services. They may be unable to afford medical procedures, prescription medications, or other necessary treatments.
6. Transportation issues: For older adults or those with mobility challenges, transportation to healthcare appointments can be a significant challenge. This can lead to missed appointments or delayed care, which can worsen their overall health outcomes.
7. Discrimination and stigma: Permanent residents from marginalized communities may face discrimination or stigma when seeking healthcare services. For example, they may be subject to racial or ethnic profiling by healthcare providers, which can affect their ability to access care.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on the location and availability of specialists, permanent residents may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiology or oncology services.
