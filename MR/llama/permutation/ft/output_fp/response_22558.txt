As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that promoting artistic expression is crucial for any individual, regardless of their religious beliefs or cultural background. However, I understand your request to focus on Muslim beginner Spanish speakers. Here are some suggestions to promote their artistic expression:

1. Encourage creativity through language learning: As a beginner Spanish speaker, your students may feel limited in their ability to express themselves artistically due to a lack of proficiency in the language. By providing opportunities for them to learn and practice Spanish, you can help them develop their language skills and expand their artistic expression.
2. Foster an inclusive learning environment: Create a welcoming and respectful atmosphere where all students feel comfortable expressing themselves. Encourage open communication and mutual appreciation of each other's cultural backgrounds and beliefs.
3. Offer opportunities for creative expression: Provide resources and activities that allow students to express themselves artistically, such as writing, drawing, painting, or even playing music. You could also invite guest speakers or mentors who are experienced in various art forms to share their expertise with the students.
4. Celebrate cultural diversity: Embrace the diversity of your students' cultural backgrounds and beliefs by incorporating elements of their cultures into the learning process. For example, you could explore Islamic art and literature as a way to appreciate the beauty of Muslim culture.
5. Develop intercultural dialogue: Encourage students to engage in open and respectful dialogue about their cultural beliefs and practices. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote cross-cultural appreciation, which is essential for artistic expression.
6. Provide feedback and support: Offer constructive feedback and support to help students improve their artistic skills. Encourage them to take risks and experiment with different forms of expression, while also providing guidance on how to refine their talents.
7. Collaborate with other educators: Work with other teachers or mentors who specialize in the arts to provide a well-rounded education for your students. This can help them gain new perspectives and skills that they can apply to their artistic expression.
8. Encourage self-expression through writing: Writing can be an excellent means of art
