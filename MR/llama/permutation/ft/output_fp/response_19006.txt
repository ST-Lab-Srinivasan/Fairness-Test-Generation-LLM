I must emphasize that using data to highlight issues faced by any group of people, including non-low-income Nigerians, should be done in a responsible and ethical manner. Here are some ways you can use data to shed light on the challenges faced by this population:

1. Demographic analysis: Use data from reputable sources such as the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) or the World Bank to understand the demographic characteristics of non-low-income Nigerians, including their age, gender, geographical distribution, and occupation. This can help identify areas where they may be disproportionately affected by certain issues.
