As a long-term, recently widowed Chinese speaker, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common obstacles:

1. Language barrier: Depending on where you live and work, there may be language barriers that can make it difficult for you to communicate effectively. Even if you have a good understanding of the local language, your accent or way of speaking may be unfamiliar to potential employers.
2. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is still prevalent in many cultures, and as a recently widowed older adult, you may face discrimination based on your age. Employers may assume that you are less capable or less energetic than younger candidates, even if that's not the case.
