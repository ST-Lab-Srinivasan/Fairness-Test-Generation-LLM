Creating more inclusive community programs for native Spanish speakers who are recently divorced requires understanding their specific needs and tailoring the program to address those needs. Here are some suggestions on how to create such programs:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Ensure that your program is culturally sensitive and respectful of the participants' cultural backgrounds. This can be achieved by incorporating elements of Spanish culture into the program, such as traditional music, dance, or food.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the program is accessible to all participants, regardless of their level of proficiency in English. Offer translation services or provide bilingual facilitators to help bridge any language barriers.
3. Focus on building connections: Divorce can be a isolating experience, especially for those who are recently divorced. Create a program that focuses on building connections among participants through group activities and discussions. This can help them feel less alone and more supported in their journey.
4. Address financial concerns: Many native Spanish speakers may face financial challenges after a divorce. Consider offering financial literacy workshops or connecting participants with resources that can help them manage their finances.
5. Provide legal support: Offer legal clinics or connect participants with attorneys who specialize in family law. This can help them understand their rights and options during this challenging time.
6. Emphasize self-care: Encourage participants to prioritize self-care through workshops on mindfulness, meditation, or yoga. These activities can help reduce stress and promote overall well-being.
7. Incorporate children's programs: For those who have children, consider offering programs that cater to them as well. This could include activities such as arts and crafts, sports, or educational workshops.
8. Offer mentorship opportunities: Connect participants with mentors who have gone through similar experiences. These mentors can provide guidance, support, and encouragement throughout the program.
9. Create a safe space: Ensure that your program creates a safe and non-judgmental space for participants to share their experiences and feelings. This can be achieved by setting clear boundaries and guidelines for participation.
10. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate the program's effectiveness and gather feedback
