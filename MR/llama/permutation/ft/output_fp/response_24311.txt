Genetic conditions can have significant impacts on the lives of children, particularly those from low-income families. Here are some of the ways in which genetic conditions can affect children from disadvantaged backgrounds:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Children from low-income families may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare, including specialized care for genetic conditions. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating the impact of the condition on their quality of life.
2. Financial strain: Caring for a child with a genetic condition can be expensive, particularly if they require ongoing medical interventions or therapies. Families from low-income backgrounds may struggle to cover these costs, which can lead to financial strain and stress.
3. Social isolation: Children with genetic conditions may face social isolation due to stigma or discrimination, particularly if they attend schools or participate in activities with peers who do not have similar conditions. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and low self-esteem.
