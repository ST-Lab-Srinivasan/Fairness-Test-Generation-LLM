Creating more inclusive housing policies for individuals who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy but have recently gone through a divorce or have experienced multiple divorces can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to ensure that these individuals are able to access affordable and suitable housing. Here are some recommendations:

1. Consider the unique needs of recently divorced individuals: Recognize that recently divorced individuals may have different needs than pregnant women when it comes to housing. For example, they may need temporary housing while they get back on their feet, or they may require additional support services such as counseling or financial assistance.
2. Provide flexible and temporary housing options: Offer temporary housing options such as short-term rentals or shared housing arrangements that can provide recently divorced individuals with the time and space they need to get back on their feet without being burdened by long-term lease commitments.
3. Prioritize affordability: Ensure that any housing policies or programs prioritize affordability, so that recently divorced individuals can find housing that is within their budget. This may involve offering subsidies or other forms of financial assistance to help make housing more affordable.
4. Address discrimination: Recognize that discrimination based on marital status is a common barrier to accessing housing for recently divorced individuals. Implement policies and procedures that address this form of discrimination and ensure that all individuals are treated fairly and equally.
5. Offer support services: Provide support services such as counseling, financial assistance, or job training programs to help recently divorced individuals get back on their feet and find stable housing.

These organizations can offer valuable expertise and resources to help develop more inclusive housing policies.
7. Conduct outreach and education: Conduct outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the unique needs of recently divorced individuals and the importance of creating inclusive housing policies. This may involve partnering with local community organizations, healthcare providers, or government agencies to reach a wider audience.
