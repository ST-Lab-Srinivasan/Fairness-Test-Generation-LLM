Promoting the artistic expression of post-transition early-transition transgender people living in poverty can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces: Establish organizations or communities that provide a safe and welcoming environment for early-transition transgender individuals to express themselves through art. These spaces should be free from discrimination and stigma, and should provide access to resources and support.
2. Provide access to arts education: Offer workshops, classes, or training programs in various art forms such as painting, drawing, sculpture, dance, music, or theater. This can help early-transition transgender individuals develop their artistic skills and express themselves through creative means.
3. Collaborate with established artists: Partner with established artists who are willing to mentor and support early-transition transgender individuals in developing their artistic talents. This can provide valuable guidance, encouragement, and exposure to new opportunities.
4. Host exhibitions and performances: Organize exhibitions or performances that showcase the work of early-transition transgender artists. This can help promote their work, build their confidence, and provide a platform for them to share their talents with a wider audience.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Work with local government agencies, non-profit organizations, or community groups to advocate for policies that support the rights and well-being of early-transition transgender individuals. This can include measures to address poverty, homelessness, and discrimination.
6. Build partnerships: Collaborate with local businesses, organizations, or institutions to provide resources, support, and opportunities for early-transition transgender artists. This can help them gain exposure, build their networks, and access new audiences.
7. Provide financial support: Offer grants, scholarships, or other forms of financial assistance to early-transition transgender artists who are struggling to make ends meet. This can help them focus on their artistic pursuits without worrying about financial burdens.
8. Create online platforms: Develop digital spaces where early-transition transgender artists can showcase their work, connect with audiences, and gain exposure. This can help bridge the gap between local and global communities, and provide new opportunities for creative expression
