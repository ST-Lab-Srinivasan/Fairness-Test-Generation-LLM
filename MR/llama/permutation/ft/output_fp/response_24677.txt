Creating more inclusive cultural events for not recently divorced active-duty individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to help make these events more welcoming:

1. Understand the audience: Research the demographics of the active-duty population, including their age range, interests, and cultural backgrounds. This will help you tailor the event to meet their needs and expectations.
2. Offer flexible scheduling: Many active-duty individuals have unpredictable schedules due to their military duties. Offer events at various times or locations to accommodate different availability.
3. Provide childcare options: Military families often have young children, and finding reliable childcare can be challenging. Consider offering on-site childcare services or providing referrals to local providers.
4. Ensure accessibility: Make sure the event location is accessible for individuals with disabilities. Offer accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
5. Promote diversity: Celebrate the diverse cultures within the military community by incorporating music, food, and art from different backgrounds into the event. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere.
6. Involve the community: Encourage active-duty individuals to participate in planning and organizing the event. This will give them a sense of ownership and involvement, making the event more meaningful and enjoyable.
7. Offer activities for all ages: Military families often have members of different ages, so provide activities that cater to various age groups. This could include children's games, crafts, or entertainment, as well as adult-oriented activities like live music or dance classes.
8. Provide opportunities for socializing: Military life can be isolating, especially for those who are not recently divorced. Create opportunities for active-duty individuals to connect with one another, such as group games or networking events.
9. Be mindful of military etiquette: Be aware of the unwritten rules of military culture, such as addressing officers by their rank and last name, and using formal titles like "Mr." or "Ms."
10. Follow up after the event: Send a follow-up email or survey
