Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach to design, programming, and community engagement. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for staff and volunteers to understand the needs and experiences of moderate native Spanish speakers. This will help them provide more effective support and services.
2. Language Accessibility: Ensure that all materials, signs, and announcements are available in both English and Spanish to cater to the diverse population. Provide language interpretation services for non-Spanish speakers and those who may need additional support.
3. Inclusive Programming: Develop programming that caters to the needs of moderate native Spanish speakers, such as cultural events, workshops, and activities that promote socialization and community building.
4. Accessible Spaces: Ensure that public spaces are accessible and inclusive for all individuals, including those with disabilities. Provide ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms to ensure equal access to facilities.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with the local Spanish-speaking community through outreach and partnerships. Listen to their needs and concerns, and work collaboratively to create more inclusive public spaces.
6. Education and Awareness: Educate staff, volunteers, and the broader community about the experiences and challenges faced by moderate native Spanish speakers. Encourage empathy and understanding through awareness-raising campaigns and events.
7. Inclusive Design: Incorporate design elements that cater to the needs of moderate native Spanish speakers, such as Braille signage, large print materials, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
8. Technology Accessibility: Ensure that technology, such as digital kiosks and wayfinding systems, is accessible and user-friendly for all individuals, including those with disabilities.
9. Collaborative Decision-Making: Involve moderate native Spanish speakers in decision-making processes to ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account when designing public spaces.
10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly assess and evaluate the inclusivity of public spaces
