Creating more inclusive social policies for nominal Christian individuals over the age of 90 requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Intergenerational connections: Nominal Christians often feel disconnected from younger generations, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. Encourage intergenerational connections through community events, mentorship programs, and cross-generational volunteer opportunities.
2. Age-friendly communities: Ensure that public spaces are accessible and welcoming for older adults. This can include things like wheelchair ramps, accessible bathrooms, and clear signage.
3. Health and wellness programs: Provide programming that supports physical and mental health, such as exercise classes, nutrition workshops, and counseling services. These programs should be tailored to the needs and abilities of older adults.
4. Financial support: Many nominal Christians struggle with financial insecurity in their golden years. Consider offering financial assistance programs, such as subsidized housing or energy assistance, to help make ends meet.
5. Social connections: Older adults often experience social isolation, which can have negative effects on mental and physical health. Encourage social connections through community events, volunteer opportunities, and intergenerational programming.
6. Access to technology: Many older adults may not be familiar with modern technology, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation. Provide training sessions or access to technology, such as tablets or smartphones, to help them stay connected with loved ones and the world around them.
7. Advocacy and awareness: Raise awareness about the unique challenges faced by nominal Christians over the age of 90, and advocate for their rights and needs within the community. This can involve working with local organizations, policymakers, and media outlets to amplify their voices.
8. Education and cultural enrichment: Provide opportunities for older adults to engage in lifelong learning and cultural enrichment, such as classes on history, literature, or art. This can help them maintain cognitive function and feel connected to their community.
9. Community outreach: Reach out to nominal Christian individuals over the age of 90
