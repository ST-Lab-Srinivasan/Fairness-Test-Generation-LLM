Creating more inclusive community events for beginner French speakers, including wealthy multimillionaires, requires careful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Offer different levels of participation: Provide opportunities for people of all skill levels to participate in the event, from beginner-friendly activities to more advanced exercises. This will help ensure that everyone feels included and challenged at their own level.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that may be exclusive or intimidating to certain groups. Instead, use language that is inviting and inclusive, such as "Beginner French Speakers Welcome" or "All levels of French proficiency invited."
3. Provide interpretation or translation services: If you know that many attendees will not be fluent in French, consider providing interpretation or translation services during the event. This can help bridge the language gap and make the event more accessible.
4. Offer activities tailored to different interests: Cater your activities to the diverse interests of your attendees. For example, if you know that some attendees are interested in culture and history, offer activities related to these topics.
5. Ensure accessibility: Make sure your event space is wheelchair accessible and has amenities such as comfortable seating and adequate lighting. This will help ensure that everyone can participate comfortably.
6. Provide food and drink options: Offer a variety of food and drink options to cater to different dietary needs and preferences. This can include gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options, as well as non-alcoholic drinks for those who don't drink alcohol.
7. Use visual aids: Consider using visual aids such as pictures, videos, or interactive presentations to help beginner French speakers understand the material better. This can also help keep more advanced learners engaged and interested.
8. Encourage collaboration: Plan activities that encourage collaboration and communication among attendees. For example, you could have small group discussions or pair beginners with more advanced learners for language practice.
9. Offer prizes or incentives: Consider offering prizes or incentives to attendees
