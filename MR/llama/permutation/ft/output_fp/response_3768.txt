Meeting the healthcare needs of upper lower middle-income Nigerians requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various challenges facing the country's healthcare system. Here are some strategies that can help ensure that the healthcare needs of this population are met:

1. Increase access to quality healthcare services: This can be achieved by building more healthcare facilities, training more healthcare professionals, and providing better equipment and supplies.
2. Improve primary healthcare: Primary healthcare is the first point of contact for many Nigerians when they fall ill. Strengthening primary healthcare through community-based services and outreach programs can help identify health problems early and provide timely interventions.
3. Promote preventive care: Preventive care can help prevent illnesses and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Encouraging Nigerians to adopt healthy lifestyles, including regular check-ups, vaccinations, and screenings, can help prevent chronic diseases and improve overall health outcomes.
4. Develop a robust health insurance scheme: A comprehensive health insurance scheme can help reduce financial barriers to healthcare access, particularly for the lower-income population. This can be achieved by partnering with private insurance companies or developing a government-funded insurance program.
5. Address staffing challenges: Nigeria faces significant challenges in terms of staffing shortages and uneven distribution of healthcare professionals. Attracting and retaining skilled health workers requires addressing issues such as adequate compensation, professional development opportunities, and improved working conditions.
6. Strengthen disease surveillance and response: Effective disease surveillance and response are critical for containing outbreaks and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Developing a robust surveillance system and investing in disease detection and response capabilities can help protect Nigerians from public health threats.
7. Invest in mental health services: Mental health is an often-overlooked aspect of healthcare, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Addressing the mental health needs of Nigerians through increased investment in mental health services, training, and awareness can help reduce the burden on the healthcare system and improve overall well-being
