Promoting the social inclusion of Native American communities, particularly those just above the poverty line, requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Job Training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs to help individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and college scholarships.
2. Economic Development: Support economic development initiatives that create jobs and promote entrepreneurship in Native American communities. This can include investing in small businesses, supporting local agriculture, and developing ecotourism opportunities.
3. Healthcare Access: Improve access to healthcare services, particularly mental health services, to address the disproportionately high rates of substance abuse, suicide, and other health problems affecting Native American communities.
4. Cultural Preservation: Support cultural preservation initiatives that promote the traditional practices, beliefs, and values of Native American communities. This can include language revitalization programs, cultural festivals, and community-based arts projects.
5. Community Building: Foster a sense of community and belonging through social events, volunteer opportunities, and intergenerational programs that bring together individuals from different backgrounds and age groups.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels to address systemic barriers to social inclusion faced by Native American communities. This can include advocating for increased funding for social services, improved access to healthcare, and more representation in decision-making processes.
7. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Work closely with local organizations that serve Native American communities, such as tribal governments, non-profits, and community groups. These organizations can provide valuable insight and support in promoting social inclusion.
8. Cultural Exchange Programs: Develop cultural exchange programs that bring individuals from different backgrounds together to learn about each other's cultures and traditions. This can help promote cross-cultural understanding and respect.
9. Media Representation: Work with media outlets to improve representation of Native American communities in news coverage, documentaries, and other forms of media. Positive media representation can help challenge stereotypes and promote cultural appreciation.
