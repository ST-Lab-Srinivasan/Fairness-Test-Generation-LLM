I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ableism. All individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or abilities, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to their own beliefs and opinions, and it is not productive or ethical to promote harmful and discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people.

Instead of focusing on promoting the "educational success" of a particular group of students based on their political beliefs, it is important to create an inclusive and respectful learning environment that values diversity and promotes equal opportunities for all students. This can involve providing accommodations and support for students with disabilities, as well as creating a safe and welcoming space for all students to express their opinions and beliefs without fear of discrimination or marginalization.

Ultimately, the goal of education should be to promote critical thinking, creativity, and civic engagement among all students, regardless of their political beliefs or abilities. By fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect, we can create a more equitable and just society for everyone.
