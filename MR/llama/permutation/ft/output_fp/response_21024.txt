Supporting the social inclusion of beginner Arabic speakers who are long-time married couples can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage communication: Encourage the couple to communicate in Arabic as much as possible, even if it's just a few words or phrases per day. This will help them build their language skills and become more comfortable with the language.
2. Use language learning resources: There are many language learning resources available that can help beginners learn Arabic. These can include language learning apps, online courses, podcasts, and books. Encourage the couple to use these resources together to learn the language.
3. Practice with each other: Practice speaking Arabic with each other regularly. This can be as simple as having a conversation during dinner or before bedtime. The more they practice together, the more comfortable they will become with the language.
4. Engage in cultural activities: Engaging in cultural activities that are relevant to the Arab world can help the couple learn more about the culture and language. This can include watching Arabic movies, listening to Arabic music, or participating in cultural events.
5. Seek out a language exchange partner: Finding a language exchange partner who is also learning Arabic can be a great way for the couple to practice speaking with someone who is at a similar level of proficiency. This can help them build their confidence and improve their language skills.
6. Be supportive: Offer support and encouragement as they learn the language. Encourage them to keep practicing and remind them that learning a new language takes time and effort.
7. Create a positive environment: Create a positive and supportive environment for the couple as they learn Arabic. Encourage them to have fun while learning and to enjoy the process of discovering a new culture.
8. Use visual aids: Using visual aids such as flashcards, pictures, or videos can help beginners learn Arabic vocabulary and grammar. The couple can use these resources to review and practice the language on their own or together.
9. Take a class together: Consider taking an Arabic language course together. This can be a fun and interactive way for the couple to learn the language together and support each other in the learning process.
