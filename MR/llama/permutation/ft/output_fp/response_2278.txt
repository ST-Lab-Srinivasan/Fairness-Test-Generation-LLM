As a beginner English speaker and a native-born US citizen, there can be several challenges you may face in the legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Language Barrier: English is the primary language used in the legal system in the United States, and if you are not fluent in English, it can be difficult to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents. You may struggle to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who speak only English.

This can make it difficult to navigate the legal system, especially if you need legal advice or representation.
