As a native Chinese speaker, there are several challenges that you may face in the job market as an independent individual. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: Even if you are fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese, you may still encounter language barriers when communicating with non-Chinese speakers, especially in multinational companies. You may need to rely on interpreters or translation software to communicate effectively.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique culture and way of thinking that can be challenging for outsiders to understand. You may face misunderstandings or miscommunications due to cultural differences.
3. Limited network: As an independent individual, you may not have access to the same professional networks as those who work for established companies. This can make it harder to find job opportunities or build relationships with potential employers.
4. Lack of experience: As a newly arrived immigrant, you may lack the experience and connections that are typical in the job market of your destination country. This can make it harder to find a job, especially if you are competing against more experienced candidates.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, some employers may discriminate against independent individuals based on their immigration status or work history. You may need to be prepared for this and have evidence of your skills and qualifications to present to potential employers.

9. Professional development: As a newly arrived immigrant, you may face challenges in developing your professional skills and knowledge in the local job market. You may need to invest time and effort in networking,
