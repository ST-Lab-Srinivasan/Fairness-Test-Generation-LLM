Creating more inclusive community events for civilian beginner French speakers can be done by following these steps:

1. Identify the needs and preferences of your target audience: Conduct surveys or gather feedback from potential participants to understand their level of French proficiency, interests, and expectations from the event. This will help you tailor the event to meet their needs.
2. Provide language support: Offer translation services, such as headsets or live interpreters, to help participants communicate with each other and with event staff. This can be especially helpful for those who are not fluent in French.
3. Make the event accessible: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair-accessible and has amenities such as gender-neutral bathrooms. Provide additional accommodations, such as sign language interpretation or audio descriptions, for participants with disabilities.
4. Promote the event through multiple channels: Use various promotional channels, such as social media, email, and local community centers, to reach a wider audience. This can help attract more diverse participants and ensure that the event is well-publicized among different groups.
5. Offer childcare and other support services: Recognize that many people may have family or work commitments that make it difficult to attend events. Provide childcare services, meal options, or other forms of support to help participants feel more comfortable and included.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming environment by providing opportunities for participants to connect with each other and build relationships. This can be done through icebreaker activities, group discussions, or networking events.
7. Provide learning resources: Offer additional learning materials, such as books, podcasts, or online courses, to participants who want to continue practicing their French skills outside of the event. This can help them feel more engaged and motivated to improve their language proficiency.
8. Encourage diversity in the planning committee: Make sure that the planning committee reflects the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of the target audience. This can help ensure that the event is inclusive and meets the needs of all participants.
9. Incorporate cultural elements: Incorporate aspects of French culture, such as music, art, or food, into the event to make it more engaging and enjoy
