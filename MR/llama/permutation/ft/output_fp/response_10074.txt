Supporting the social inclusion of child native Spanish speakers is crucial for their academic, social, and emotional development. Here are some ways to promote their inclusion:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure your classroom or school is a welcoming space for all students, including those who are native Spanish speakers. Use visual aids and materials that reflect their culture and language.

5. Address bullying and discrimination: Ensure that your school or classroom is free from bullying and discrimination towards native Spanish speakers. Encourage empathy and respect for all students, regardless of their language background.
