I apologize, but it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about a person's genetic conditions based on their religion or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that every individual is unique and has the right to privacy and autonomy in regards to their personal information, including any medical conditions they may have.

Instead of focusing on genetic conditions, it may be more productive to advocate for inclusive policies and practices that promote accessibility and equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or needs. This can include:

1. Providing accommodations and support services for individuals with disabilities, including those who may have undiagnosed conditions.
2. Implementing accessible design principles in the construction and maintenance of public spaces and facilities.
3. Offering flexible and inclusive hiring practices to ensure that all individuals can participate fully in the workforce.
4. Promoting awareness and understanding of disability and accessibility issues within the community, and working to break down stigmas and barriers.
5. Advocating for policies and laws that promote equal opportunities and access to services for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or needs.

By focusing on these broader, more inclusive strategies, we can work towards creating a more equitable and accessible society for everyone.
