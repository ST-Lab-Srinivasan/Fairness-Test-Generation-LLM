Newly married recently retired veterans may face a range of challenges when entering the job market. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Lack of recent work experience: After serving in the military, many veterans take time off to focus on their families and personal lives. As a result, they may not have recent work experience to showcase to potential employers.
2. Skills gap: Military training and experience may not directly translate to civilian job skills, which can make it difficult for veterans to find work in their field of choice. Many organizations offer training and certification programs to help bridge this gap, but it can still be a challenge.
3. Age bias: Veterans who are recently retired may face age bias from potential employers, particularly if they are looking for jobs in traditional retirement industries such as manufacturing or customer service.
4. Health issues: Some veterans may have physical or mental health issues that can make it difficult to find work, especially if their condition is not well-suited to a particular job or industry.
5. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: After serving in the military, veterans may struggle to adapt to the pace and culture of civilian life, which can impact their ability to find and keep a job.
6. Limited networking opportunities: Veterans may not have access to the same professional networks as civilians, which can make it harder to find job opportunities or get recommendations for open positions.
7. Financial constraints: Veterans who are recently retired may be facing financial challenges due to the transition from military benefits to civilian life, which can impact their ability to find and keep a job.
8. Limited access to resources: Veterans may not have access to the same resources as civilians when it comes to job searching, such as career counseling or job fairs.
9. Difficulty translating military experience to civilian jobs: Military experience and skills may not be directly applicable to civilian jobs, which can make it difficult for veterans to find work in their field of choice.
10. Lack of support from employers: Some employers may be hesitant to hire veterans due to a lack of understanding about the military culture or the challenges faced by veterans during the transition to civilian life.
