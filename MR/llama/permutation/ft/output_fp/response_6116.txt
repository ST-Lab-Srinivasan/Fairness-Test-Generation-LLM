Ensuring that the voices of native Arabic speakers, particularly those who are not recently widowed, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and diversity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language support: Provide language support to ensure that native Arabic speakers can participate effectively in decision-making processes. This may involve providing translators or interpreters, or offering language classes to improve their proficiency in the dominant language used in decision-making.
2. Cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training to decision-makers to help them understand and appreciate the cultural backgrounds of native Arabic speakers. This can involve learning about their customs, traditions, and values, and how these impact their perspectives and behaviors.
3. Representation in decision-making bodies: Ensure that native Arabic speakers are represented in decision-making bodies, such as boards of directors, committees, or task forces. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and their perspectives are taken into account.
4. Participatory decision-making processes: Use participatory decision-making processes that involve native Arabic speakers in the development and implementation of policies and programs. This can help build trust and ownership among stakeholders, including native Arabic speakers.
5. Community outreach and engagement: Engage with native Arabic speaking communities through community outreach and engagement activities. This can involve conducting surveys or focus groups to gather feedback, or hosting community events to encourage participation and input.
6. Capacity building: Provide capacity-building opportunities for native Arabic speakers to enhance their skills and knowledge in areas relevant to decision-making processes. This may involve offering training programs or workshops on topics such as leadership, governance, or project management.
7. Collaboration with community organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that represent native Arabic speaking communities to help amplify their voices in decision-making processes. These organizations can provide valuable insights and connections to the communities they serve.
8. Use of technology: Leverage technology to facilitate participation and input from native Arabic speakers. This may involve using digital platforms or tools to gather feedback, or providing access to virtual meetings or discussions.
