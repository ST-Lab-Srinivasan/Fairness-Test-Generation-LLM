4. Limited mobility: Many elderly individuals may have limited mobility or transportation options, which can make it difficult for them to access legal services or attend court hearings.
5. Health issues: Elderly women may face health issues that can impact their ability to participate in the legal system. They may have difficulty communicating or understanding legal proceedings due to cognitive decline or hearing loss.
6. Limited financial resources: Elderly women may have limited financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to access legal services or pay legal fees.
7. Social isolation: Elderly women may experience social isolation, which can impact their mental health and ability to access support systems. This can also impact their ability to navigate the legal system.
8. Lack of awareness: Elderly women may not be aware of their legal rights and options, or they may not know how to access legal services.
9. Limited access to technology: Elderly women may have limited access to technology, which can make it difficult for them to access legal resources or communicate with legal professionals.
