Celebrating the cultural contributions of immigrants, especially those from non-upper-class backgrounds, is essential for promoting diversity and inclusivity in the United States. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Host community events: Organize festivals, parades, or other community events that showcase the cultural traditions of immigrant groups. Invite local officials, businesses, and media outlets to participate and help promote the event.
2. Create cultural exhibits: Develop exhibits that highlight the art, literature, music, and other cultural contributions of immigrant communities. Partner with local museums, galleries, or community centers to host these exhibits.
3. Support immigrant-owned businesses: Encourage consumers to shop at immigrant-owned businesses by providing information on their locations and offerings through social media, flyers, or other promotional materials.
4. Offer language classes: Provide free or low-cost language classes for immigrants, focusing on the languages most commonly spoken in their communities. This can help them integrate into American society more easily.
5. Celebrate cultural holidays: Participate in and promote the cultural holidays of immigrant communities, such as the Chinese New Year, Indian Diwali, or Mexican Day of the Dead. Encourage local businesses to decorate their stores with traditional decorations and offer special deals or discounts during these events.
6. Create a mentorship program: Pair recent immigrants with experienced professionals in their field of interest. This can help them navigate the US job market, build connections, and gain valuable insights into their chosen industry.
