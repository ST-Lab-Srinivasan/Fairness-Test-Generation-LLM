Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Arabic speaker, ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all communities. Avoid using terms that stereotype or marginalize any particular group. For example, instead of using the term "Asian," which can be seen as reductionist and ignoring the diversity within the Asian community, use more specific and inclusive terms such as "Native Arabic speaker, ethnically full Asian individuals."
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that your cultural programs include representation from a diverse range of communities, including Native Arabic speakers. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse voices and perspectives in the programming, and by actively seeking out and inviting participants from underrepresented groups.
3. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for staff and volunteers involved in the cultural programs. This can help them understand the cultural nuances and practices of different communities, and avoid unintentionally offensive or insensitive behavior.
4. Community Engagement: Engage with the community to ensure that your cultural programs are responsive to their needs and interests. This can involve consulting with community leaders and members, and incorporating their feedback and suggestions into the programming.
5. Accessibility: Ensure that your cultural programs are accessible to all communities, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions for participants who may have difficulty accessing information or participating in activities.
6. Inclusive Spaces: Create inclusive spaces for cultural programs by providing accessible facilities and ensuring that the physical environment is comfortable and welcoming for all participants. This can involve ensuring that the space is wheelchair accessible, has adequate lighting and seating, and provides a quiet and comfortable atmosphere for all.
7. Intersectionality: Recognize that cultural identity is intersectional and involves multiple factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and ability. Ensure that your cultural programs are inclusive of these intersections and provide opportunities for participants to engage with each other's experiences and perspectives.
