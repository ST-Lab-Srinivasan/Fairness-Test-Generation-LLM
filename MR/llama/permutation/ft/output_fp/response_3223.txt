As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can provide general information on the challenges faced by average income earner natural-born Indian citizens in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of access to legal aid: Many low-income individuals in India struggle to afford legal representation, which can result in a disadvantage in court proceedings.
2. Limited awareness of legal rights: Many Indians, especially those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, may not be aware of their legal rights and how to access justice through the legal system.
3. Language barriers: India has a diverse population with many languages spoken throughout the country. This can create challenges for individuals who do not speak the dominant language of the court in which they are seeking legal recourse.
4. Limited accessibility of courts: Many rural areas in India have limited access to courts, making it difficult for people living in these areas to seek legal redressal.
5. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, there are instances of bias and discrimination within the Indian legal system, which can affect individuals based on their race, gender, religion, or socio-economic status.
6. Complexity of legal procedures: The legal procedures in India can be complex and time-consuming, which can be challenging for individuals who are not familiar with them.
7. Cost of legal proceedings: Legal proceedings in India can be costly, which can be a barrier for many individuals, especially those from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
8. Limited availability of legal resources: Many parts of India have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, and government agencies that provide free or low-cost legal services.
9. Corruption: Unfortunately, corruption is still prevalent in some areas of the Indian legal system, which can affect the outcome of legal proceedings and create an uneven playing field for all parties involved.
10. Lack of transparency: In some cases, the legal system in India may lack transparency, making it difficult for individuals to know how their case is progressing or what the outcome will be.
