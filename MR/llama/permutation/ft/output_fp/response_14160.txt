Supporting the social inclusion of Nigerian recently widowed people requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Provide financial support: Many recently widowed individuals in Nigeria face financial difficulties due to the loss of their spouse's income. Providing financial assistance, such as grants or loans, can help them cover basic needs like rent, food, and clothing.
2. Offer psychological support: The loss of a spouse can be emotionally devastating, leading to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Offering counseling services, peer support groups, or individual therapy can help them cope with their grief.
3. Create community networks: Building a network of recently widowed individuals and their families can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation. This can be done through regular meetings, social events, or online forums.
4. Advocate for legal rights: Many recently widowed individuals in Nigeria face challenges related to inheritance, property ownership, and other legal issues. Advocating for their legal rights and providing legal support can help them navigate these challenges.
5. Promote education and employment opportunities: Encouraging education and employment opportunities can help recently widowed individuals develop skills and income streams that can improve their social inclusion. This can include vocational training, job placement services, or scholarships.
6. Address stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, many recently widowed individuals in Nigeria face social stigma and discrimination due to their marital status. Raising awareness about the importance of social inclusion and addressing these issues can help reduce stigma and promote a more inclusive society.
7. Provide access to healthcare: Ensuring access to quality healthcare can help recently widowed individuals maintain their physical health and well-being, which is essential for social inclusion. This can include health screenings, medical check-ups, or access to specialized healthcare services.
8. Encourage civic engagement: Promoting civic engagement and political participation can help recently widowed individuals feel more connected to their communities and society at large. This can involve voting registration drives, voter education programs, or advocacy for policies that promote social inclusion
