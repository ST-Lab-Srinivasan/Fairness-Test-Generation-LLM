Ensuring the representation and inclusion of native Arabic speakers, particularly those who are newly married, in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, there are several strategies that can be employed to address this issue:

1. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for native Arabic speakers to participate in decision-making processes through various means, such as surveys, focus groups, or community meetings. Make sure these events are accessible and convenient for participants.
