3. The Black Star Line Festival: Held in Los Angeles, this festival celebrates African culture, music, and art, featuring performances by Nigerian artists and other African diaspora groups.
4. The Nigerian American Cultural Center: Based in New York City, this center promotes the arts, culture, and heritage of Nigeria and the Nigerian-American community through exhibitions, workshops, and educational programs.
