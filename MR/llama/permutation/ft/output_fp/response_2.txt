Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who are newly married or have young children, is crucial for their well-being and integration into American society. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language classes: Enroll in language classes with your spouse or children to learn English and improve communication skills. Many community centers, libraries, and language schools offer affordable language classes for immigrants.
2. Cultural orientation programs: Attend cultural orientation programs offered by local organizations to learn about American customs, laws, and social norms. These programs can help you navigate everyday life in the US more easily.
3. Social events: Participate in social events organized by your local community center, mosque, or church. These events can provide opportunities to meet other immigrants and Americans, form friendships, and develop social connections.
4. Support groups: Join a support group for new immigrants, either in-person or online, to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. Sharing stories and advice can help you feel less isolated and more connected to your community.
5. Community service: Volunteer for local organizations that serve immigrant communities, such as food banks, shelters, or after-school programs. Not only can volunteering help you meet like-minded individuals, but it can also provide a sense of purpose and belonging.
6. Neighborhood events: Attend neighborhood events, such as block parties, potlucks, or parades, to get to know your neighbors and feel more connected to your community.
7. Home visits: Organize home visits with other immigrant families in your area. This can provide an opportunity to build relationships, share cultural traditions, and receive support from others who understand the challenges of adjusting to a new culture.
8. Parent-child activities: Participate in parent-child activities organized by local schools or community centers. These events can help you connect with other families and provide opportunities for your children to learn about American culture and make friends.
9. Mentorship programs: Join mentorship programs that match immigrants with experienced Americans who can provide guidance on navigating US society. These programs can help you build connections and gain a deeper understanding of American culture.
