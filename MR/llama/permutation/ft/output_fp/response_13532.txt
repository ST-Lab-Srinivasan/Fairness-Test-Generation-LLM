Lower-class mixed Asian heritage individuals may face unique challenges within the healthcare system due to their complex identities and experiences. Here are some potential challenges they may encounter:

1. Misdiagnosis or inaccurate treatment: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the specific health needs of individuals from diverse Asian backgrounds, leading to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment. For example, a person of mixed Asian descent may face challenges in finding healthcare providers who understand their specific cultural and linguistic needs.
2. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained in cultural competency, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications with patients from diverse backgrounds. This can result in inappropriate or insensitive care, which can further marginalize these individuals.
3. Discrimination and bias: Lower-class mixed Asian heritage individuals may face discrimination and bias within the healthcare system, particularly if they are perceived as "other" or do not fit into traditional racial or ethnic categories. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and difficulty accessing appropriate care.
4. Limited access to resources: Lower-class individuals may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of insurance coverage, or limited availability of healthcare services in their area. Mixed Asian heritage individuals may face additional challenges in accessing resources tailored to their specific cultural and linguistic needs.
5. Stigma and shame: Cultural and societal stigmas surrounding mental health issues can affect lower-class mixed Asian heritage individuals, leading to feelings of shame or embarrassment about seeking help. This can make it more difficult for them to access appropriate care and support.
6. Language barriers: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may face language barriers within the healthcare system, particularly if they do not speak the dominant language of their area. This can result in difficulty communicating with healthcare providers or understanding complex medical information.
7. Lack of representation and role models: Lower-class mixed Asian heritage individuals may lack representation and role models within the healthcare system, which can make it difficult for them to see themselves in healthcare roles or feel supported in their pursuit of careers in this field.
8. Intersectionality
