As an advanced aged (over 85) Native American natural-born US citizen, you may face several challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Ageism: Unfortunately, age can be a significant factor in the legal system, and older adults may face discrimination or bias due to their age. This can result in a lack of understanding or empathy from legal professionals, which can negatively impact your case.
2. Decline in cognitive abilities: As you age, your cognitive abilities may decline, which can affect your ability to understand and navigate the legal system. You may need additional support or accommodations to ensure that your rights are protected.
3. Health issues: Older adults may have chronic health issues that can impact their ability to participate in legal proceedings. For example, mobility issues may prevent you from attending court hearings, and hearing or vision loss may make it difficult to understand legal documents.
4. Limited access to resources: Older adults may face financial challenges that limit their access to legal resources such as lawyers, experts, and investigators. This can put them at a disadvantage compared to younger individuals who have more financial resources.
5. Lack of representation: Older adults may not have family members or friends who are aware of their legal issues or able to assist them in navigating the legal system. As a result, they may not have adequate representation in court proceedings.
6. Difficulty understanding legal terminology: Legal language can be complex and confusing, especially for those without a legal background. Older adults may struggle to understand legal documents and procedures, which can lead to mistakes or misunderstandings that can negatively impact their case.
7. Limited mobility: As you age, you may experience physical limitations that can make it difficult to travel to court hearings or meet with legal professionals. This can result in missed opportunities for resolution or settlement.
8. Limited access to transportation: Public transportation options may be limited in some areas, making it challenging for older adults to attend court hearings or appointments with legal professionals.
9. Lack of familiarity with technology: The legal system increasingly relies on technology, such as electronic filing systems and online case management
