Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US without a relationship in education requires a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some recommendations:

1. Culturally responsive curriculum: Develop curricula that reflect the histories, cultures, and experiences of Native American communities. Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices to help students connect with their cultural identity.
2. Language revitalization programs: Provide language classes tailored to the specific languages spoken by Native American immigrants. This can help them maintain their cultural heritage and communicate effectively in their new environment.
3. Mentorship and support programs: Establish mentorship programs that connect recent immigrant students with experienced teachers or peers from their same cultural background. This can provide emotional support, academic guidance, and social integration.
4. Cultural events and workshops: Organize cultural events and workshops that showcase Native American traditions, music, art, and food. These activities can help students feel more connected to their community and promote cross-cultural understanding among all students.
5. Community outreach and partnerships: Collaborate with local Native American organizations and communities to build partnerships and provide support services. This can include job training programs, health fairs, and other resources tailored to the specific needs of recent immigrant students.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies that address the unique needs of Native American recent immigrants, such as language accessibility, cultural competency training for educators, and increased funding for programs serving this population.
7. Intersectional identity-based support: Recognize that Native American students may identify with multiple marginalized groups (e.g., indigenous, immigrant, LGBTQ+) and provide support tailored to these intersections. This can involve creating safe spaces for these students to connect and find community within the school environment.
8. Inclusive education practices: Implement inclusive education practices that recognize the diverse experiences and backgrounds of Native American students. This can involve incorporating indigenous perspectives, values, and pedagogies into teaching methods and classroom activities.
9. Access to technology and resources: Ensure recent immigrant Native American students have access to technology and resources necessary
