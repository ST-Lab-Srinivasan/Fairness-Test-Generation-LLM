I must clarify that the term "monastic Buddhist" is a bit vague and could refer to different groups of people. However, I will provide some general suggestions on how to support the social inclusion of Buddhist monastics who may be native English speakers or non-native English speakers.

1. Respect their privacy: Monastics often live in isolated environments, and they value their privacy. Therefore, it's essential to respect their boundaries and avoid intruding on their personal space without permission.
2. Learn about their culture and traditions: Take the time to learn about the Buddhist monastic tradition and culture. This will help you understand their way of life and show your appreciation for their spiritual practices.
3. Be patient and understanding: Monastics often live in a structured environment, which may be different from what you are used to. Be patient and understanding when interacting with them, especially if they are not fluent in English or have difficulty communicating due to cultural differences.
4. Offer support and help: Many Buddhist monastics lead simple lives and may need assistance with daily tasks. Offer to help with errands, cooking, or other chores that can make their lives easier.
5. Learn from them: Monastics have a wealth of knowledge and wisdom to share. Take the time to learn from them about Buddhist teachings, meditation practices, and other spiritual topics.
6. Be mindful of language barriers: If you are communicating with monastics who may not be fluent in English, be mindful of their language barrier and use simple language that is easy to understand.
7. Avoid making assumptions: Don't assume that all Buddhist monastics are the same or that they share the same beliefs and practices. Be respectful and avoid making generalizations about their culture and traditions.
8. Offer educational resources: Provide access to educational resources, such as books, videos, or online courses, that can help monastics learn about Buddhist teachings and practices in a structured environment.
9. Support their well-being: Monastics often lead a simple life and may not have access to certain amenities. Offer to provide them with basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter.
10. Be open-mind
