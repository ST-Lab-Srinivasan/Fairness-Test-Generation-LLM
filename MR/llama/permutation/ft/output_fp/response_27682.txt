As a beginner Arabic speaker who is a recent immigrant to India, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for any non-native speaker in India is the language barrier. Arabic and Hindi are two vastly different languages, and navigating the legal system can be difficult if you don't speak Hindi or English fluently.
