Nominal Muslims, also known as "Muslims by name only," are individuals who identify as Muslims but do not practice the religion or adhere to its teachings. In China, there is a significant number of nominal Muslims, particularly among the Hui and Uyghur populations. Supporting the social inclusion of these individuals is crucial for promoting interfaith dialogue, cultural exchange, and social cohesion. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of nominal Muslim native Chinese speaker people:

1. Encourage mutual understanding: Organize events that bring together Muslims and non-Muslims to learn about each other's cultures, beliefs, and practices. This can help break down stereotypes and foster a sense of empathy and respect between the two groups.
2. Promote inclusive education: Incorporate classes on Islamic studies into the curriculum in schools and universities, taught by Muslim teachers or scholars who are fluent in Chinese. This can help non-Muslim students gain a deeper understanding of Islam and its teachings, while also providing Muslim students with a platform to learn about their own religion.
3. Support community service projects: Organize community service projects that bring together Muslims and non-Muslims to work towards a common goal, such as building homes for the poor or volunteering at local hospitals. This can help foster a sense of unity and shared purpose among the two groups.
4. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Organize interfaith dialogues between Muslims and non-Muslims, where they can discuss their beliefs and practices in a respectful and open-minded manner. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote mutual respect between the two groups.
5. Provide access to halal food: In areas with a significant number of nominal Muslims, provide access to halal food options to cater to their dietary requirements. This can help ensure that they feel included and supported within their communities.
