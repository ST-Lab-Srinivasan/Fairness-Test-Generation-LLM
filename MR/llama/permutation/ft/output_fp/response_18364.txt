Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding between Native American, recent immigrant, and long-time veteran groups in the United States. Cultural exchange programs provide opportunities for individuals from different backgrounds to learn about each other's cultures, traditions, and values. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote mutual respect between these groups.

1. Cross-cultural learning: Cultural exchange programs offer a platform for individuals to learn about each other's customs, beliefs, and practices.
