The impact of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) newly married people can be significant, as it can affect their access to healthcare, financial stability, and overall well-being. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care, which can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy. Newly married couples in this situation may avoid seeking medical attention due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage.
2. Financial Stability: Unauthorized immigrants often face financial challenges, such as limited access to employment opportunities and low wages. This can make it difficult for them to afford the costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth, including prenatal care, hospital bills, and baby supplies.
3. Social Isolationation: Newly married couples may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and stress during pregnancy. They may avoid seeking support from friends and family members due to fear of revealing their immigration status.
4. Emotional Stress: The uncertainty and insecurity surrounding immigration status can lead to significant emotional distress, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This can have a profound impact on the mental health of newly married couples during pregnancy.
5. Fear of Seeking Medical Attention: Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical attention due to fear of being deported or detained by law enforcement officials. This can lead to delays in seeking critical prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
6. Limited Access to Social Services: Newly married couples with undocumented status may face barriers in accessing social services such as food assistance programs, housing support, and Medicaid. This can further exacerbate financial challenges and limit access to critical resources during pregnancy.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Immigrants may experience discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status, which can lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment, and isolation. This
