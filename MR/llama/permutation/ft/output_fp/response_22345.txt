As a freedom advocate for Native American recent immigrants to the US, there are several challenges that they may face in the healthcare system. Here are some of the key issues:

1. Language barriers: Many Native Americans may not speak English fluently, which can create communication barriers when trying to access healthcare services. Interpreters or translators may be needed to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients.
