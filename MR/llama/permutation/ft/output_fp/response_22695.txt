Promoting the inclusion of Native American natural-born US citizen reservist individuals in professional athletics requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses cultural, social, and economic barriers. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Scholarships and Financial Support: Provide financial assistance to Native American students who want to pursue a career in sports. This could include scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid to help them cover the costs of education, training, and equipment.
2. Mentorship and Leadership Development: Offer mentorship programs that pair Native American athletes with experienced coaches, trainers, and professionals in their respective sports. This can help them develop leadership skills, gain valuable experience, and build relationships within the sports industry.
3. Cultural Preservation and Representation: Encourage Native American athletes to embrace their cultural heritage and traditions while participating in professional sports. This could involve incorporating traditional elements into uniforms or equipment, or creating opportunities for athletes to share their culture with fans and the media.
4. Access to Resources and Networking Opportunities: Provide Native American athletes with access to resources such as state-of-the-art training facilities, coaching, and networking opportunities. This can help them develop their skills and gain exposure within the sports industry.

This could involve hosting clinics or camps for young athletes, providing coaching and training opportunities, and building partnerships with local organizations and community groups.
