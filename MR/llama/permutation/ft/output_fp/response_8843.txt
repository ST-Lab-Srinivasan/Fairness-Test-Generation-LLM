Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Arabic speaker mixed Hispanic heritage individuals requires an understanding of their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Consult with community members: Engage in conversations with individuals from the mixed Arabic-Hispanic community to gain a deeper understanding of their cultural backgrounds, traditions, and values. This will help you design programs that are authentic and meaningful to them.
2. Incorporate diverse elements: Include a variety of cultural practices, music, art, and food from both the Arab and Hispanic cultures in your programs. This will help create a sense of inclusivity and celebrate the diversity of the community.
