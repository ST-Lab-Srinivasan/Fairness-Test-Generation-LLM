Family support is a crucial factor in the success of lower middle-income secular Jewish people. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to their success:

1. Emotional Support: Lower middle-income secular Jewish people often face unique challenges such as discrimination, financial struggles, and identity issues. Having a supportive family can help them cope with these challenges emotionally and mentally.
