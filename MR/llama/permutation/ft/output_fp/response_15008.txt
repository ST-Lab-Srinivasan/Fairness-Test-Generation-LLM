Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-lifelong single beginner English speakers. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence an individual's identity:

1. Language acquisition: As a non-lifelong single beginner English speaker, an individual may face challenges in learning and mastering the language. This can impact their sense of self and identity, particularly if they feel like they are struggling to communicate effectively or connect with others.
