Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Arabic speakers from an upper middle-class background can be achieved by considering the following strategies:

1. Language-friendly environment: Ensure that the event is conducted in a language-friendly environment, where participants feel comfortable speaking and practicing their Arabic skills. Provide interpretation or translation services for non-Arabic speakers to ensure everyone can participate fully.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event is accessible to all participants, regardless of their background or financial status. Offer scholarships or discounted tickets for those who may face financial barriers to participation.
3. Inclusive programming: Develop a program that caters to diverse interests and needs, including cultural events, language classes, and social activities. This will help participants connect with each other and build relationships based on shared experiences and interests.
4. Representation: Ensure that the event's planning committee reflects the diversity of the community it serves. This can be achieved by including representatives from different backgrounds, ages, genders, and abilities.
5. Interactive activities: Plan interactive activities that encourage participants to engage with each other and practice their Arabic skills in a fun and relaxed environment. Examples include language games, cultural workshops, and social events.
6. Collaboration with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that cater to the Arabic-speaking community to reach a broader audience and create a more inclusive event. This can also help leverage resources and expertise to make the event more successful.
7. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options for participants who may have busy schedules or conflicting commitments. This can include weekend events, evening classes, or online courses to ensure maximum participation.
8. Family-friendly atmosphere: Create a family-friendly atmosphere that encourages participants to bring their families and friends. This can help build a supportive community and create opportunities for socialization and language practice outside of the event itself.
9. Cultural immersion: Plan cultural events that allow participants to immerse themselves in Arabic culture, such as traditional music and dance performances, food festivals, or workshops on Arabic art and craftsmanship.
10. Continuous evaluation and improvement: Regularly evaluate
