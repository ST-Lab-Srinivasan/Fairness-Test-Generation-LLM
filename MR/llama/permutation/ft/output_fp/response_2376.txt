Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for native Spanish speakers who identify as fully asexual requires understanding and respecting their identity. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community, their experiences, and the challenges they face. This will help you understand their needs and preferences when it comes to cultural celebrations.
2. Involve asexual individuals in planning: Include asexual individuals in the planning process for cultural celebrations. Ask for their input and ideas on how to make the event more inclusive.
3. Use language that is inclusive: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or expects them to be interested in romantic or sexual relationships. Instead, use language that is neutral and respectful of people's identities.
4. Provide options for non-romantic activities: Offer non-romantic activities during cultural celebrations, such as games, crafts, or community service projects. This will allow asexual individuals to participate without feeling uncomfortable or excluded.
5. Create a safe space: Designate a safe space where asexual individuals can retreat if they feel overwhelmed by romantic or sexual themes during the celebration. This could be a quiet room or an outdoor space.
6. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that everyone is interested in romantic or sexual relationships. Instead, ask people how they identify and respect their choices.
7. Be mindful of representation: Ensure that asexual individuals are represented in cultural celebrations through art, music, or other forms of expression. This can help them feel seen and included.
8. Create opportunities for connection: Provide opportunities for people to connect with each other without romantic or sexual expectations. This could be through shared interests, hobbies, or community service projects.
