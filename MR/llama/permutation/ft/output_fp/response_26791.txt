As a sociolinguist, I can provide some insights on the challenges that native French speakers newly married people may face in the job market. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barriers: For native French speakers who are newly married to someone from another country or region, there may be language barriers that can affect their ability to communicate effectively in the workplace. They may need to learn a new language or dialect, which can be a significant challenge, especially if they are not familiar with the language or culture of their spouse's region.
2. Work-life balance: Newly married people may find it challenging to balance their work and personal life, particularly if their spouse has different work schedules or cultural expectations around family responsibilities. This can lead to stress and burnout, which can impact their job performance and overall well-being.
3. Career advancement: Newly married people may face challenges in advancing their careers due to various factors such as lack of experience, limited networking opportunities, or discrimination based on their marital status. They may also feel pressure from their spouse or family members to prioritize family over career goals.
4. Stereotyping and bias: Unfortunately, there are still stereotypes and biases against married people in the workplace, particularly if they have children. Employers may assume that married people are less committed to their jobs or less flexible, which can affect their opportunities for advancement.
5. Childcare responsibilities: Newly married people with young children may find it challenging to manage childcare responsibilities while also maintaining a demanding job. They may need to adjust their work schedules or take time off to care for their children, which can impact their career progress.
6. Lack of support: Newly married people may not have access to the same level of support and resources as their single colleagues, particularly if they are from a different cultural background. They may feel isolated or excluded from workplace social events or networking opportunities.
7. Cultural differences: If the newly married person is from a different culture or region than their spouse, there may be cultural differences that affect their job performance and communication styles. For example, they may have different expectations around work hours, communication channels, or office dynamics.
