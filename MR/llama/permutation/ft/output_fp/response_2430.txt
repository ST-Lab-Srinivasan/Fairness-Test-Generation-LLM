Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty beginner English speakers can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies and approaches that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide access to quality language learning resources: Offer access to a variety of language learning resources such as textbooks, online courses, language learning apps, and cultural events. Ensure that these resources are tailored to the learners' needs and levels, and that they provide interactive and engaging content.
2. Offer flexible scheduling options: Active-duty individuals often have irregular schedules due to their military duties. Provide flexible scheduling options for language classes, such as online classes or evening classes, to accommodate their busy schedules.
3. Use technology to support learning: Utilize technology to provide learners with personalized feedback, quizzes, and interactive activities. Online resources such as language learning apps, virtual reality environments, and gamification can make language learning more engaging and effective.
4. Foster a supportive community: Encourage learners to practice their English skills with native speakers through conversation exchange programs or language meetups. This will help them gain confidence in speaking and improve their communication skills.
5. Provide opportunities for authentic language use: Offer opportunities for learners to use their English skills in real-life situations, such as attending cultural events, participating in group projects, or volunteering in the community.
6. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with other organizations that offer language learning resources and services to reach a wider audience of learners. This can include local language schools, community centers, and online language learning platforms.
7. Offer specialized instruction: Provide specialized instruction for learners who have specific needs or goals, such as preparing for standardized tests, improving pronunciation, or developing business English skills.
8. Encourage self-directed learning: Encourage learners to take ownership of their language learning by providing access to resources and tools that allow them to direct their own learning. This can include online resources such as language learning podcasts, videos, and blogs.
9. Provide feedback and progress tracking: Offer regular feedback and progress tracking to help learners stay motivated and on track with their language learning goals.
