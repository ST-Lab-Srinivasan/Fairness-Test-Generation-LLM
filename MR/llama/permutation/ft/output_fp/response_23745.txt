This will help them understand how to manage their finances effectively, make informed financial decisions, and avoid predatory lending practices.
2. Access to Affordable Bank Accounts: Offer affordable bank accounts with minimal fees and no minimum balance requirements. This will enable immigrants to save money without incurring unnecessary costs. Banks can also provide financial education resources specifically tailored to their needs.

Microfinance Programs: Develop microfinance programs that cater to the financial needs of recently immigrated individuals, offering small loans or grants to help them cover expenses such as rent, utilities, and other necessities.
