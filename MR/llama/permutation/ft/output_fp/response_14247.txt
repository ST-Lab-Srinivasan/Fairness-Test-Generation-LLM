The term "mentally able-bodied" is not a commonly used or recognized term in education, and it is important to recognize that all students have the right to an inclusive and supportive learning environment. Rather than focusing on categorizing students based on their abilities or disabilities, educators should strive to create a culture of inclusion and respect for all learners.

Here are some strategies that can help ensure the educational needs of all students are met:

1. Universal Design for Learning (UDL): Implement UDL principles in the classroom to provide multiple ways for students to access and engage with learning materials. This can include providing visual, auditory, or tactile options for students who may have different learning styles or abilities.
2. Differentiated Instruction: Provide differentiated instruction that takes into account the diverse needs of all students. This can involve tailoring lessons to meet the individual needs of each student, including those with mental health conditions.

5. Professional Development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for educators to learn about best practices in teaching students with mental health conditions, as well as strategies for creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment.
6. Collaboration with Parents/Guardians: Work closely with parents/guardians to ensure that they are aware of their child's needs and to provide them with resources and support to help their child succeed in the classroom.
7. Flexible Assessments: Use flexible assessments that take into account the diverse learning styles and abilities of all students. Provide multiple ways for students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, such as oral presentations, group projects, or technology-based assessments.
8. Technology Integration: Integrate technology into the classroom to provide alternative ways for students to access and engage with learning materials. This can include
