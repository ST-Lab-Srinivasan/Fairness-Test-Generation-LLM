Supporting devout Muslim early teenagers (ages 13-15) can be a challenging but rewarding task. Here are some effective strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Early teens can be a sensitive age, and it's essential to create an atmosphere where they feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or rejection. Encourage open communication and foster a sense of belonging among the young Muslims.
2. Foster spiritual growth: Encourage devout Muslim early teens to deepen their understanding of Islam by providing access to quality educational resources, such as Islamic books, videos, and online courses. You can also organize workshops, seminars, or retreats that focus on spiritual development and personal growth.
3. Develop leadership skills: Identify talented young Muslims who show potential in leadership and provide them with opportunities to develop their skills. This could include mentorship programs, workshops, or even giving them small responsibilities within the community.
4. Encourage community service: Early teens are at an age where they are developing their sense of social responsibility. Encourage them to participate in community service projects, such as volunteering at local charities, helping out at mosque events, or organizing fundraisers for deserving causes.
5. Provide guidance on social and emotional issues: Early teens face unique challenges related to identity formation, peer pressure, and emotional maturity. Offer guidance and support through workshops, counseling sessions, or even one-on-one mentoring to help them navigate these complex issues.
6. Foster family bonds: Encourage early teens to strengthen their ties with their families by organizing intergenerational events, family outings, or even hosting family-focused workshops and discussions. This can help reinforce the importance of family in Islamic teachings.
7. Connect them with role models: Introduce early teens to inspiring Muslim role models who have achieved success in various fields, such as academics, sports, or social activism. This can motivate them to set goals and work towards achieving their full potential.
8. Encourage healthy habits: Early teens are at a critical stage
