Providers who are culturally competent can recognize and respect these practices, leading to more accurate diagnoses and treatments.
4. Enhanced patient satisfaction: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they create a positive experience for patients. Patients are more likely to feel satisfied with their care when they feel that their provider understands and respects their cultural background.
