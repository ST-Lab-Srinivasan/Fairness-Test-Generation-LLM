Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique cultural background, experiences, and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Incorporate traditional Native American teachings and practices into the classroom curriculum to make it more relevant and engaging for students. This could include incorporating stories, songs, and art from Native cultures into lessons.
2. Language support: Provide language support for Native American students who may be learning English as a second language. This could include bilingual education programs or language classes specifically designed for recent immigrants.
3. Cultural competency training: Offer cultural competency training for teachers to help them understand the specific needs and experiences of Native American students. This could include training on cultural norms, traditions, and history.
4. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Native American students with successful Native American role models in their community. This can help build confidence and provide a sense of belonging for students who may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers.
5. Traditional knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum to help students connect with their cultural heritage. For example, incorporating traditional plant medicine knowledge into science lessons can help students see the relevance of their culture to their education.
6. Community engagement: Foster partnerships between schools and local Native American communities to provide support and resources for students. This could include guest speakers, cultural events, and opportunities for students to participate in community service projects.
7. Family engagement: Engage with the families of Native American students to provide support and resources for them as well. This could include parent-teacher conferences, family events, and opportunities for families to learn about their child's education.
8. Addressing historical trauma: Recognize the historical trauma that Native American communities have experienced and how it has impacted their education. Provide resources and support for students who may be struggling with the lingering effects of historical trauma.
9. Cultural celebrations: Celebrate Native American cultural events and traditions in schools to help create a sense of community and belonging among students. This could include Powwows,
