I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their immigration status. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that immigration status can have significant impacts on a person's life, including their access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare, as well as their ability to work and support themselves and their families.

It is also important to recognize that immigration status is not the only factor that determines a person's socioeconomic status or opportunities in life. Other factors, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and access to education and healthcare, can also play a significant role in shaping an individual's experiences and outcomes.

In general, it is important to approach conversations about immigration with sensitivity and respect for the dignity and human rights of all individuals involved. It is not productive or fair to make generalizations about any group of people based on their immigration status. Instead, it is important to strive for a nuanced understanding of the complex issues surrounding immigration and to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
