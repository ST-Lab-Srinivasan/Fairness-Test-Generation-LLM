The impact of immigration status on the lives of just-above-poverty-line independent individuals can be significant, as it can affect their access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited access to employment opportunities: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when trying to find work due to their immigration status. They may be hesitant to apply for certain jobs or might not be eligible for certain positions, leading to limited career advancement opportunities.
2. Inability to access social services: Immigrants who are undocumented or have a temporary status may struggle to access essential social services like healthcare, education, and housing assistance. This can exacerbate existing poverty levels and limit their ability to improve their economic situation.
3. Vulnerability to exploitation: Due to their immigration status, some independent individuals may be more susceptible to exploitation by employers or landlords. They may be hesitant to report any abuse or mistreatment for fear of being deported or losing their job.
