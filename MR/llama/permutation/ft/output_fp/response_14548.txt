Non-libertarians, or those who do not subscribe to the principles of libertarianism, may face various challenges in the job market beyond just being above the poverty line. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the location and industry, there may be limited job opportunities for non-libertarians, particularly in fields that are highly regulated or dominated by libertarian-leaning companies.
2. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on political beliefs or affiliations still exists in some parts of the world. Non-libertarians may face bias or discrimination during the hiring process or in the workplace.

You may feel like an outsider or face resistance from colleagues who do not understand or respect your perspectives.
4. Lack of opportunities for advancement: If you work for a company with a strong libertarian culture, you may find it difficult to advance in your career if you do not subscribe to the same political beliefs as your superiors or colleagues.
5. Limited access to networking opportunities: Depending on the industry and location, non-libertarians may have limited access to networking opportunities that can help them advance their careers. This can be particularly challenging if you work in a field with strong libertarian influence.
