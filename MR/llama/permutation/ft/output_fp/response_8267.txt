3. Language support: Provide language support services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to facilitate communication between public space staff and users who are not fluent in the dominant language of the area.
4. Inclusive programming: Offer a range of programs and activities that cater to the diverse interests and needs of independent native Arabic speaker individuals. This could include cultural events, language classes, or recreational activities like sports or art.

6. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support independent native Arabic speaker individuals, such as community centers, cultural associations, or advocacy groups. These partnerships can help amplify outreach efforts and ensure that the designed public spaces are responsive to local needs.
