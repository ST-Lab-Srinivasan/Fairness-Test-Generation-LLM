The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of older adults (those over 90 years old) can be significant and varied. Some common challenges faced by this population include:

1. Increased risk of developing age-related diseases: As people age, their risk of developing age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and osteoporosis increases. Genetic conditions can also increase this risk.
2. Reduced mobility and dexterity: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience reduced mobility and dexterity, making it more difficult to perform daily tasks and maintain independence.
3. Increased risk of falls and injuries: As people age, their balance and coordination decline, increasing the risk of falls and injuries. Genetic conditions can also contribute to this increased risk.
4. Emotional and psychological challenges: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience emotional and psychological challenges such as anxiety, depression, and social isolation.
5. Limited access to healthcare: Older adults may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of specialized care for genetic conditions.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience stigma and discrimination from family members, communities, and healthcare providers, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Older adults with genetic conditions may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system, including finding specialized care and accessing resources.
8. Impact on family dynamics: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on family dynamics, particularly if the condition affects multiple generations. This can lead to emotional stress, financial burdens, and changes in family roles and responsibilities.
