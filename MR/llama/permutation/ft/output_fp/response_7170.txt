Creating more inclusive community programs for Nigerian lifelong recently single individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and supportive:

1. Conduct a needs assessment: Engage with the target population, including recent widows/ers, to understand their specific needs, challenges, and preferences. This will help inform the design of the community program.
2. Develop a diverse steering committee: Assemble a group of individuals from different backgrounds and experiences to guide the development and implementation of the program. This can include representatives from various age groups, genders, ethnicities, and socio-economic statuses.
3. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for older and younger generations to interact, learn from each other, and build relationships. This can be done through joint activities, mentorship programs, or simply by providing a space for people of different ages to socialize.
4. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that the community program is accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, braille signage, and assistive listening devices. This can also involve hiring staff who are fluent in local languages and have experience working with people with disabilities.
5. Offer flexible programming options: Develop a range of activities and events that cater to different interests, abilities, and schedules. For example, some individuals may prefer group exercise classes, while others may find one-on-one mentorship more beneficial.
6. Promote cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural practices and values of the Nigerian community when designing the program. This can involve incorporating traditional music, dance, or art forms into activities, as well as respecting dietary restrictions and religious practices.
7. Encourage social connections: Create opportunities for individuals to connect with one another through shared interests or experiences. This can be done through group outings, potlucks, or simply providing a space for people to meet and interact.
8. Provide support services: Offer resources such as counseling, legal aid, or financial planning to help recent widows/ers navigate the challenges of loss and transition.
9. Engage with local organizations: Collaborate with other community groups, non-profits
