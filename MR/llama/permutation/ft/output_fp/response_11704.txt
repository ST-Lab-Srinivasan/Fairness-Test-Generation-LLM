Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, particularly for native Arabic speakers who are natural-born US citizens. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate more effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds. This is critical for native Arabic speakers, as they may have different communication styles and preferences than other populations. Providers who are culturally competent can adapt their communication style to better meet the needs of these patients.
2. Increased patient trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, it helps build trust between the provider and patient. Native Arabic speakers may feel more comfortable sharing personal information and seeking medical care when they perceive that their provider understands and respects their cultural values.

7. Better identification of mental health needs: Native Arabic speakers may have different mental health needs than other populations. Cultural competence can help healthcare providers identify these needs and provide culturally appropriate interventions.
8. Increased awareness of cultural nuances: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent are more aware of the cultural nuances that may
