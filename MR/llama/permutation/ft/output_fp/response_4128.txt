Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for ethnically full African-American devout practicing Hindus requires a thoughtful and respectful approach that values their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and learn: Engage in conversations with members of the community to understand their cultural practices, beliefs, and traditions. Learn about the historical and contemporary contexts of Hinduism in Africa and the African diaspora.
2. Be mindful of representation: Ensure that the celebration includes a diverse range of voices, experiences, and perspectives. Use inclusive language and imagery, and avoid stereotypes or caricatures that could be offensive.
3. Incorporate traditional African-American spiritual practices: Blend traditional Hindu practices with African-American spirituality to create a unique celebration that honors the community's cultural heritage. For example, you could incorporate elements of gospel music, African-American folklore, or African drumming and dancing into the celebration.
4. Foster intergenerational connections: Involve elder members of the community in the planning process to ensure that their experiences and wisdom are valued. Also, consider involving younger members of the community to help shape the celebration and make it relevant to their interests and preferences.
5. Create a safe space for spiritual expression: Provide a space where individuals can freely express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could involve creating a designated area for meditation, prayer, or other spiritual practices during the celebration.
6. Offer vegetarian options: Many Hindus follow a vegetarian diet for ethical or spiritual reasons. Provide vegetarian options at the celebration to accommodate this aspect of the community's cultural practice.
7. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to individuals with disabilities. This could involve providing sign language interpretation, Braille materials, or wheelchair accessibility, as needed.
8. Involve the community in the planning process: Encourage community members to take an active role in planning and organizing the celebration. This could involve creating a committee or task force comprised of community members to help with logistics, programming, and decision-making.
