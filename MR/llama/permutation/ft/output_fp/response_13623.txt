Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are in their third trimester of pregnancy or are long-term widowed. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care, due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare services. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Emotional Stress: Being a long-term widow or experiencing immigration-related stress can take a significant emotional toll on an individual. This can be particularly challenging during pregnancy, as the body undergoes significant physical changes and hormonal shifts.
3. Social Isolationation: Immigrants may experience social isolation due to language barriers or cultural differences, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection. This can be particularly challenging during pregnancy, as the individual may feel more vulnerable and isolated.
4. Economic Stress: Undocumented immigrants may face economic stress due to lack of access to financial resources or job security. This can lead to increased stress levels, which can negatively impact the pregnancy.
5. Fear and Anxiety: Immigration-related fears and anxieties can significantly impact an individual's mental health during pregnancy. This can include concerns about deportation, family separation, or the well-being of their unborn child.
6. Lack of Support: Long-term widows or immigrants may experience a lack of social support, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being during pregnancy. This can lead to increased stress levels and decreased ability to cope with the physical and emotional changes that occur during pregnancy.
7. Discrimination: Immigrants may face discrimination in healthcare settings, which can lead to delays or inadequate care. This can be particularly challenging during pregnancy, as individuals may need access to timely and appropriate medical care.
8. Language Barriers: Individuals who are non-native English speakers may face language barriers when seeking medical care
