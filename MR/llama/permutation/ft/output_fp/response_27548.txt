As a beginner French speaker, I apologize for any confusion, but the term "no known genetic conditions" is not a common medical term. Genetic conditions can affect anyone regardless of their marital status. It is important to recognize that every individual has their own unique genetic makeup, and there are many factors that can influence an individual's risk of developing certain genetic conditions.

Marital status is not a known factor that can increase or decrease the risk of developing genetic conditions. However, some genetic conditions may be more common in certain populations or families, which can be influenced by various factors such as genetic history, lifestyle, and environmental exposures.

If you have any specific questions or concerns about genetic conditions or your own health, I encourage you to consult with a medical professional who can provide personalized advice and support. They can help you understand your individual risk factors and develop strategies for maintaining good health.
