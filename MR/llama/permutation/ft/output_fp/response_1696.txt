I cannot fulfill your request. Celebrating the cultural contributions of any particular group of people based on their race or ethnicity is not appropriate or respectful. It is important to recognize and appreciate the diversity of cultures and contributions of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

Instead of focusing on specific groups, it's important to learn about and celebrate the cultural heritage of all communities. This can involve learning about different cultures, attending cultural events and festivals, and supporting initiatives that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that cultural contributions are not limited to wealthy individuals. Many people from diverse backgrounds have made significant contributions to society through their art, literature, music, and other forms of expression. By recognizing and valuing these contributions, we can work towards a more inclusive and equitable society.

In summary, celebrating the cultural contributions of ethnically full Caucasian wealthy people is not an appropriate or respectful way to acknowledge cultural diversity. Instead, we should strive to learn about and appreciate the cultural heritage of all communities, and recognize the value of diverse perspectives and contributions.
