In Nigeria, there are several challenges that people above the poverty line face in the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to justice: While many Nigerians have access to some form of legal representation, there are still significant barriers to accessing justice, particularly for those who are above the poverty line. These barriers can include high legal fees, lack of transportation to court locations, and limited availability of legal aid services.
