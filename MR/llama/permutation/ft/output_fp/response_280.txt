The impact of immigration status on the lives of long-term widowed individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Long-term widows may face challenges accessing healthcare due to their immigration status. They may worry about being denied medical care or facing discrimination in healthcare settings. This can lead to delays or neglect of medical needs, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the unborn child.
2. Financial strain: Widows often face financial challenges, particularly if their spouse's death resulted in a loss of income. Immigration status can further complicate matters by limiting access to financial resources and social support networks. Long-term widows in their third trimester of pregnancy may struggle to afford basic necessities, let alone unexpected medical expenses or other costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth.
3. Social isolation: Long-term widows may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their community. This can be particularly challenging during pregnancy, when social support is crucial for both the mother's mental and physical health.
4. Fear and anxiety: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can lead to significant fear and anxiety for long-term widows in their third trimester of pregnancy. This can manifest as depression, anxiety attacks, or other mental health issues that can impact the mother's well-being and the health of her unborn child.
5. Lack of representation: Long-term widows may face barriers to accessing legal representation due to their immigration status. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the immigration system, seek refugee protection, or access other forms of support.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Immigration status can lead to stigma and discrimination against long-term widows in their third trimester of pregnancy. This can result from societal attitudes towards immigration, as well as biases within the healthcare system. As a result, long-term widows may experience marginalization or exclusion from medical care,
