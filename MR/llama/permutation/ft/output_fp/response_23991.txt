Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American recent immigrants to the United States as it provides them with guidance, support, and encouragement. Here are some ways mentorship can benefit Native American recent immigrants:

1. Cultural Navigation: Navigating a new cultural environment can be challenging for anyone, especially for those from marginalized communities. A mentor who is familiar with the cultural nuances of both the Native American community and the US society can help mentees navigate these differences and avoid cultural shocks or misunderstandings.
