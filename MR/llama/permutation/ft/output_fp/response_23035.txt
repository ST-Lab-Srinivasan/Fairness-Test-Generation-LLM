Supporting advanced older adults (ages 90 and above) can present unique challenges, as their cognitive and physical abilities may decline. Here are some effective strategies to support these communities:

1. Adaptable programming: Offer flexible programming that caters to individual needs and abilities. This could include small group sessions or one-on-one activities tailored to each participant's interests and capabilities.
2. Intergenerational connections: Facilitate opportunities for older adults to connect with younger generations through mentorship, volunteering, or joint activities. This can help combat loneliness and isolation while fostering a sense of community and purpose.
3. Cognitive stimulation: Design programs that challenge cognitive functioning but do not overly stress the participants. Examples could include memory games, brain teasers, and problem-solving exercises that promote mental stimulation without causing undue anxiety or frustration.
4. Physical activity: Incorporate physical activities that are safe, enjoyable, and tailored to individual abilities. This could include chair yoga, tai chi, or other gentle exercise programs that promote mobility and balance while minimizing the risk of injury.
5. Emotional support: Create a supportive environment where older adults feel comfortable sharing their experiences, concerns, and emotions. This can involve regular check-ins, group discussions, or one-on-one counseling sessions with trained staff or volunteers.
6. Technology integration: Introduce technology that enhances engagement and social interaction for older adults, such as video conferencing, tablets, or smartphones. This can help bridge the gap between isolated individuals and their families or communities.
7. Community outreach: Foster partnerships with local organizations and community groups to extend the reach of your support services. This could include partnering with senior centers, libraries, or other organizations that serve older adults.
8. Volunteer involvement: Encourage volunteers from various age groups to participate in activities and events designed for advanced older adults. This can help create a sense of connection and shared purpose among the volunteers, while also enriching the lives of the older adults they serve.
9. Caregiver support: Provide resources and support
