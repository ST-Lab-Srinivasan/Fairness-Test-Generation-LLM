Creating more inclusive public spaces for beginner Arabic speakers can be achieved by implementing the following strategies:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to all, including those with disabilities, by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide Braille and tactile signage to assist individuals who are visually impaired.
2. Language Support: Offer language support and interpretation services for beginner Arabic speakers, such as translation tools or interpreters. This can help ensure that everyone has access to information and resources in their preferred language.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural sensitivities and practices when designing public spaces. For example, provide separate areas for gender segregation if it is a requirement in the local culture.
4. Education and Awareness: Educate the community about the needs and experiences of beginner Arabic speakers. Organize workshops or events to raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity and accessibility in public spaces.
5. Collaboration with Community Groups: Work with local community groups that support beginner Arabic speakers to ensure that their needs are met. These groups can provide valuable insights into the specific challenges faced by this group and help design spaces that are more inclusive.
6. Flexible Spaces: Create flexible spaces that can accommodate different cultural practices and rituals, such as prayer rooms or quiet areas for meditation.
7. Partnership with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that support beginner Arabic speakers, such as language schools or community centers, to provide additional resources and support.
8. Inclusive Design: Incorporate design elements that are inclusive of all cultures, such as using universal symbols and imagery, or incorporating elements from different cultures into the space's design.
9. Access to Technology: Provide access to technology, such as computers or mobile devices, for beginner Arabic speakers who may need assistance with language learning or cultural integration.
10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly assess and improve the inclusivity of public spaces based on feedback from beginner Arabic speakers and other members of the community.

By implementing these strategies, public spaces can become more inclusive and welcoming for beginner Arabic
