Deep in poverty, long-term undocumented individuals face significant challenges when seeking healthcare in many countries. These challenges can include:

1. Lack of access to healthcare services: Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities or facing legal consequences. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate illnesses and lead to poor health outcomes.
2. Limited English proficiency: Many undocumented immigrants may have limited English proficiency, making it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system, fill out medical forms, or communicate their symptoms to healthcare providers.
3. Lack of insurance coverage: Undocumented immigrants are often ineligible for public health insurance programs, such as Medicaid or Medicare, and may not have access to private insurance. This can make it difficult for them to afford medical care, including preventive services like check-ups and screenings.
4. Fear of discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may fear discrimination from healthcare providers, which can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and reluctance to seek care.
5. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of undocumented immigrant communities, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
6. Lack of knowledge about available resources: Undocumented immigrants may be unaware of the resources available to them, such as community clinics or sliding-fee scale clinics, which can provide affordable medical care.
7. Difficulty in accessing specialized care: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing specialized care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or orthopedic surgeons, due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about these resources.
8. Fear of deportation: Undocumented immigrants may fear being deported if they seek medical care, particularly if they are in a detention center or have been reported to immigration authorities.
9. Limited access to mental health services: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing mental health services,
