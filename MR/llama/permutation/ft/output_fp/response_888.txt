Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently converted Christian individuals, especially those who come from non-Christian backgrounds. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Intersection of Faith and Culture: For many people, their religious beliefs are deeply intertwined with their cultural identity. As a result, when they convert to Christianity, they may feel like they are losing an important part of themselves. This can lead to a sense of disconnection from their cultural heritage and a struggle to reconcile their new faith with their old cultural practices.
2. Loss of Cultural Practices: Many newly converted Christians may feel pressure to abandon their traditional cultural practices in favor of Christian ones. This can lead to a loss of cultural identity and a feeling of not belonging. For example, if a person grows up in a Muslim family but converts to Christianity, they may feel like they are giving up an important part of themselves by no longer observing Islamic practices such as prayer or fasting.

They may feel like they don't fit in with their new Christian community, or that they are not living up to the expectations of their new faith. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from both their old cultural identity and their new religious community.

For example, they may have grown up believing in spirits or ancestor worship, but now they are expected to reject these practices as part of their Christian faith. This can lead to inner turmoil and confusion about one's identity.
