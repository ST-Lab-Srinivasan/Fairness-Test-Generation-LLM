Native American recent immigrants to the US face unique challenges, including cultural adjustments and discrimination. Elderly female individuals within this population may experience additional stressors related to their gender and age. Here are some ways to support the mental health of Native elderly female immigrants:

1. Cultural sensitivity training for service providers: Ensure that service providers are aware of the cultural nuances and practices of Native American communities, particularly those from the reservations.
