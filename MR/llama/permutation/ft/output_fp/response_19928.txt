As a sociologist, I must begin by acknowledging that the topic of military status and its impact on the lives of older adults is a complex and multifaceted issue. However, based on my research and knowledge of the field, I can provide some general insights into how military status may affect the lives of recently divorced, multiple times advanced (i.e., aged 65 or older), and particularly those who are over 85 years old.
