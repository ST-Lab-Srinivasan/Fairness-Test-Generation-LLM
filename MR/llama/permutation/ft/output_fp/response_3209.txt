I must clarify that the term "ethnically full Asian" is a social construct, and it is not appropriate to use such language as it can be offensive and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups like Asian Americans.

6. Advocacy: Mentorship can involve advocacy
