As a AI language model, I do not have access to real-time data or research on the experiences of beginner Chinese speakers in the healthcare system. However, I can provide some general insights on the challenges that non-native English speakers may face when interacting with medical professionals and accessing healthcare services in an English-speaking country like Mexico.

1. Language barriers: One of the biggest challenges faced by non-native English speakers is the language barrier. Limited proficiency in English can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively with medical professionals, understand medical terminology, and navigate the healthcare system.
2. Cultural differences: Mexican culture has different customs, values, and beliefs than those of English-speaking countries. As a result, beginner Chinese speakers may find it challenging to adapt to the local culture and practices in the healthcare system.
3. Lack of familiarity with medical terminology: Non-native English speakers may struggle to understand medical terminology and procedures, which can lead to confusion and anxiety when interacting with medical professionals.
4. Difficulty accessing healthcare services: Beginner Chinese speakers may face challenges in accessing healthcare services due to language barriers or cultural differences. They may have difficulty navigating the healthcare system, finding the right medical professionals, or understanding how to access necessary services.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, non-native English speakers may experience stigma and discrimination in the healthcare system due to their language proficiency or cultural background. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can negatively impact their overall health and well-being.
6. Limited resources: Beginner Chinese speakers may have limited access to healthcare resources, such as interpreters or translation services, which can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively with medical professionals.
7. Difficulty trusting medical professionals: Non-native English speakers may have difficulty building trust with medical professionals due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can lead to delays in seeking medical care or misunderstandings about their health conditions.
8. Limited access to preventive care: Beginner Chinese speakers may have limited access to preventive care services, such as routine check-ups or screenings
