Addressing the needs of blue-collar beginner Arabic speaker individuals in disaster response requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique language barriers and cultural backgrounds. Here are some strategies to help address these needs:

1. Provide Language Support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for blue-collar workers who may not have had the opportunity to learn Arabic before. This can help them communicate more effectively with local communities and responders during disaster situations.
2. Adapt Disaster Response Materials: Create disaster response materials, such as posters, flyers, and brochures, in simple Arabic language that blue-collar workers can easily understand. Use visual aids and images to help convey important messages.
