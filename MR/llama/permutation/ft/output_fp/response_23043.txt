There have been several successful advocacy campaigns for the rights of native French speakers, particularly in regions where French is not the dominant language. Here are some examples:

1. Quebec, Canada: In the 1970s and 1980s, the Quebecois independence movement gained momentum, leading to demands for greater recognition of French as a official language in Quebec. Advocacy groups such as the Mouvement Ontarion pour la Langue Française (MOLF) and the Association Quebecoise pour la Francophonie (AQF) worked to protect the rights of French speakers in Quebec, including the right to receive public services in French.
