Family support plays a significant role in the success of Native American recent immigrants to the US with a genetic condition. Here are some ways in which family support can impact their success:

1. Emotional Support: Having a strong support system within one's family can help alleviate stress and anxiety related to the genetic condition, as well as the challenges of adapting to a new country and culture. Family members can provide emotional support through listening, offering words of encouragement, and helping to problem-solve.
2. Practical Assistance: Family members can offer practical assistance in managing the condition, such as help with daily tasks, errands, and medical appointments. They can also act as caregivers, providing physical and emotional support during periods of crisis or when the individual is unable to care for themselves due to illness or injury.
3. Cultural Knowledge and Understanding: Family members who are familiar with the cultural nuances and beliefs of both the Native American and US cultures can provide valuable insights and guidance in navigating these complex cultural contexts. They can help individuals navigate cultural differences, build relationships with healthcare providers, and access resources that may be specific to their cultural background.
4. Advocacy: Family members can act as advocates for the individual, helping them access resources and services that may not be readily available or accessible. This can include navigating complex healthcare systems, securing financial support, and building relationships with community organizations and service providers.
5. Social Support: Having a strong network of family and friends can help individuals with genetic conditions build social connections and a sense of belonging in their new community. This can help combat feelings of isolation and loneliness that may arise from being a recent immigrant to a new country.
6. Role Modeling: Family members who have successfully navigated similar challenges can serve as role models for the individual, providing inspiration and motivation to overcome their own challenges. This can include sharing their own experiences, offering advice and guidance, and demonstrating resilience and determination in the face of adversity.
7. Legal Support: Family members may be able to provide legal support, such as helping with paperwork, translating documents, or providing access to legal resources that may be specific to their cultural background.
