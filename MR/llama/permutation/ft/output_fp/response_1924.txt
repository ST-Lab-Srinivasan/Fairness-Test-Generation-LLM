The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who are not long-time married can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face barriers in social interactions, including difficulty forming and maintaining relationships, particularly if they live in areas with limited access to disability support services or have limited mobility.
2. Employment challenges: Discrimination, lack of accommodations, and physical limitations can hinder the ability of people with disabilities to find and maintain employment, leading to financial strain and dependence on family members or government support.
3. Health disparities: People with disabilities may experience poorer health outcomes due to inadequate access to healthcare services, lack of understanding by healthcare providers, and social isolation.
4. Limited access to education: Barriers such as physical environments, transportation issues, and societal attitudes can prevent people with disabilities from accessing or completing education.
5. Increased vulnerability to abuse: People with disabilities may be more susceptible to elder or financial abuse due to their dependence on others for support.
6. Limited independence: Depending on family members or caregivers for daily tasks can lead to a lack of autonomy and control over one's life.
7. Stigma and social stigmatization: Disability status can lead to social exclusion, discrimination, and negative stereotypes, which can further erode self-esteem and well-being.
8. Lack of representation and voice: People with disabilities may have limited opportunities for participation in decision-making processes, leading to a lack of representation and influence over policies that affect their lives.
9. Limited access to recreational activities: Inaccessible public spaces, transportation systems, and lack of inclusive recreational programs can limit the ability of people with disabilities to participate in leisure activities.
10. Financial strain: The additional costs of disability-related expenses, such as assistive technology, home modifications, and medical equipment, can put a significant financial burden on individuals and families.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not inherent to disability status but rather the result of systemic barriers and discrimination.
