As a native French speaker and an Indian citizen, you may face several challenges when accessing healthcare services in India. Here are some of the common difficulties that you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: As a non-native English speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers who may not speak French or your native language. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can have serious consequences in the healthcare setting.
2. Cultural differences: India has a diverse culture, and you may find that some cultural practices or beliefs are not widely accepted or understood by healthcare providers. For example, some Indian communities may have different beliefs about what constitutes appropriate medical care, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts with healthcare providers.
3. Limited accessibility: Many parts of India have limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. This can make it difficult for you to access the care that you need, especially if you are living in an area with limited healthcare facilities.
