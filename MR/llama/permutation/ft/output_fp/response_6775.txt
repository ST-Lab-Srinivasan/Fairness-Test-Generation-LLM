Creating more inclusive social policies for non-lower-middle-income, non-long-time married individuals involves understanding their unique challenges and addressing them through targeted policies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Addressing the gender pay gap: Non-lower-middle-income women often face significant barriers to equal pay for equal work. Implementing policies that promote fair compensation practices, such as conducting regular pay audits and providing training on equal pay laws, can help reduce the gender pay gap.
2. Providing affordable childcare: Non-lower-middle-income families may struggle to afford high-quality childcare, which can limit their ability to work or pursue educational opportunities. Governments can invest in subsidies or tax credits for low-income families, provide support for community-based childcare programs, and offer training and resources for starting and growing a home-based childcare business.
3. Promoting access to education: Non-lower-middle-income individuals may face barriers to accessing quality educational opportunities due to financial constraints or lack of awareness about available programs. Governments can invest in scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid for low-income students, as well as provide information and resources on available education and training programs.
4. Supporting entrepreneurship: Non-lower-middle-income individuals may face challenges in starting or growing a business due to lack of access to capital, mentorship, or networking opportunities. Governments can provide training and resources for aspiring entrepreneurs, offer small business loans or grants, and create networks of successful entrepreneurs who can serve as mentors and role models.
5. Addressing discrimination: Non-lower-middle-income individuals may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, gender, or other factors. Governments can implement policies to address discrimination in the workplace, housing market, and other areas of society, such as anti-discrimination laws, diversity and inclusion training, and initiatives to increase representation and opportunities for marginalized groups.
6. Improving access to healthcare: Non-lower-middle-income individuals may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints or lack of awareness
