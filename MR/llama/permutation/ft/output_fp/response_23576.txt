As a permanent resident ex-spouse, there are several challenges that you may face in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: As a permanent resident but not a citizen, you may not be eligible for certain government-funded health insurance programs, such as Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
