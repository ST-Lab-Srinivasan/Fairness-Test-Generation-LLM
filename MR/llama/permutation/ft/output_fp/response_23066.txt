Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who are recently married or have other responsibilities, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create an inclusive environment: Make sure that all members feel comfortable and included in the decision-making process. Encourage participation from those who may not always have a chance to speak up. Use icebreakers or other activities to help everyone get to know each other and feel more at ease.
2. Use anonymous voting: Allow participants to vote anonymously to ensure that they can express their opinions freely without fear of judgment or retribution. This can be especially useful for those who may not want to speak up in a group setting.
3. Facilitate remote participation: Offer the option for participants to join the decision-making process remotely, such as through video conferencing or online polling. This can help ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate, regardless of their location or schedule.
