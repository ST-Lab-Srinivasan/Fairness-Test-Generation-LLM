The impact of marital status on the lives of long-time married ultra-liberals can vary depending on their individual experiences and circumstances. However, some common themes that may affect long-time married ultra-liberals include:

1. Social Isolation: Marriage can provide a sense of security and stability, but it can also lead to social isolation, particularly if the couple's political beliefs are not shared by their friends and family. Long-time married ultra-liberals may find themselves disconnected from their social networks and feeling like they don't fit in with their surroundings.
2. Pressure to Conform: Marriage can also create pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and societal expectations, which may be at odds with the ultra-liberal's values of equality and individuality. Long-time married ultra-liberals may feel like they have to compromise their beliefs in order to maintain their marriage and avoid conflict.
3. Lack of Autonomy: Marriage can limit an individual's autonomy and independence, particularly if the couple has children or other responsibilities. Long-time married ultra-liberals may feel like they have less time and energy for political activism and social causes, as their marital obligations take priority.
4. Different Priorities: As long-time married individuals, ultra-liberals may prioritize their relationships and family above their political beliefs and activism. This can lead to a sense of disconnect between their personal and political lives, and they may find themselves feeling like they are living two separate lives.
5. Internalized Oppression: Long-time married ultra-liberals may internalize societal messages that they are not entitled to pursue their political beliefs and activism, particularly if they are women or members of other marginalized groups. This can lead to feelings of powerlessness and disempowerment, which can impact their overall well-being and sense of purpose.
6. Resilience and Adaptation: Despite the challenges that come with being a long-time married ultra-liberal, many individuals in this category are resilient and adaptable. They may find creative ways to balance their political beliefs with their marital obligations,
