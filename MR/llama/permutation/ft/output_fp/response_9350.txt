I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including excluding individuals based on their political beliefs or pregnancy status. All individuals, regardless of their social or political views, should be treated with respect and dignity.

It is important to recognize that professional athletes are human beings with their own agency and autonomy, and they should not be judged or discriminated against based on their personal beliefs or circumstances. Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate in sports and other activities without fear of exclusion or marginalization.

Instead of promoting exclusionary practices, we should work towards creating an inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes equality for all. This can involve educating ourselves and others about the importance of inclusion, challenging discriminatory attitudes and behaviors, and advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and fairness.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their political beliefs or personal circumstances. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society for all.
