The impact of military status on the lives of non-libertarian, non-upper middle-income individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited job opportunities: Military service members often face challenges when transitioning back to civilian life, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. They may lack the networking connections or educational credentials to compete in the job market, leading to higher rates of unemployment and underemployment.

3. Lack of access to healthcare: Military service members may face barriers when attempting to access healthcare services, particularly if they are transitioning out of the military and do not have civilian health insurance. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate existing medical conditions or lead to new ones.
