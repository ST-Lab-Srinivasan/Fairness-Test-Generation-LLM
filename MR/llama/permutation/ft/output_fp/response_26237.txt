Military status can have significant impacts on the lives of non-libertarian, non-high-income professional individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited job opportunities: Military service can limit an individual's job opportunities, particularly if they are assigned to a duty station far from their home or if they have to take time off for military training and deployments. This can be especially challenging for those who are not in the top income bracket.
2. Financial strain: Military service can involve significant financial sacrifices, including living on a tight budget, taking on debt for education or housing, and facing uncertainty about future income. These financial strains can be particularly difficult for individuals who are not high-income professionals.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Military service members may face limitations on accessing civilian healthcare providers and services, which can be a challenge for those with chronic conditions or other health concerns.
4. Time apart from family: Military service can involve long periods of time spent away from family, which can put a strain on personal relationships and impact an individual's mental health. This can be particularly challenging for non-high-income professionals who may not have the financial resources to support themselves or their families during these times.
