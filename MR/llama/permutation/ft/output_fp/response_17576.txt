Creating more inclusive cultural events for recently divorced, multiple times civilian individuals requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming:

1. Flexibility in scheduling: Offer events at different times and days of the week to accommodate various schedules, including those who may have limited time or energy after a divorce.
2. Accessible venues: Choose venues that are easily accessible for people with mobility issues or transportation challenges. Provide clear directions and parking information to make it easier for attendees to get there.
3. Affordable ticket prices: Consider offering free or low-cost tickets to make the event more inclusive, especially for those on a tight budget after a divorce.
4. Family-friendly activities: Include events that are suitable for families with children, such as kid-friendly entertainment, play areas, or babysitting services. This can help divorced individuals who may be struggling to balance work and family responsibilities.
5. Supportive atmosphere: Create a comfortable and supportive environment by providing mental health resources, such as counseling services or support groups, during or after the event. This can help attendees feel more at ease and open up about their experiences.
6. Representation in media: Use diverse marketing materials and promotional content to showcase the diversity of attendees, including those who may have gone through multiple divorces. Highlight the unique perspectives and experiences of this group to create a more inclusive atmosphere.
7. Educational content: Offer workshops or seminars on topics relevant to recently divorced individuals, such as financial planning, co-parenting, or mental health management. This can help provide practical support and resources during a challenging time.
8. Social activities: Organize social events that encourage mingling and networking, such as speed dating or group outings. These activities can help divorced individuals meet new people and build connections in a welcoming environment.
9. Safe space: Establish a safe space for attendees to share their experiences and emotions without fear of judgment. This could be through designated discussion groups, anonymous feedback channels, or simply creating a comfortable atmosphere where people feel free to express themselves
