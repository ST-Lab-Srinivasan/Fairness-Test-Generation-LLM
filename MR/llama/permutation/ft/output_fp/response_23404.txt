As a non-binary person, I face many challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the issues that I encounter:

1. Gendered language and forms: The legal system is filled with gendered language and forms that do not acknowledge my identity. For example, many legal documents and forms require me to check a male or female box for my gender, which is not only offensive but also invalidates my identity.
