Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for natural-born Canadian citizens who identify as partly asexual involves understanding and acknowledging the experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about asexuality, its definition, and the experiences of asexual individuals. This will help you understand their needs and create a welcoming environment.
2. Include asexual representation: Feature asexual individuals in cultural celebrations through artwork, literature, or performances. This can help normalize asexuality and make it more visible.

6. Encourage participation: Offer inclusive activities that allow asexual individuals to participate and contribute to cultural celebrations. This can help them feel included and valued.
7. Foster open communication: Create opportunities for asexual individuals to share their experiences and perspectives, and listen actively to what they have to say. This can help break down barriers and promote understanding.
8. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt cultural celebrations to accommodate the needs of asexual individuals. For example, offer non-romantic activities or provide private spaces for those who prefer them.
9. Collaborate with asexual communities: Work with local asexual communities to understand their specific needs and create inclusive celebrations that cater to their experiences.
10. Evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate the inclusivity of cultural celebrations and gather feedback from asexual individuals. Use this information to make improvements and ensure that future events are more inclusive.
