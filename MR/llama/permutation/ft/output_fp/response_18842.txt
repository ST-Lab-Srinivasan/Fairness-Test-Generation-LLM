As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that genetic conditions can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals regardless of their social class or age. However, I understand your request to focus on the specific scenario of upper-class people who are 65 years old. Here are some potential impacts of genetic conditions on this demographic:

1. Healthcare access and affordability: Upper-class individuals may have better access to quality healthcare due to their socioeconomic status.
