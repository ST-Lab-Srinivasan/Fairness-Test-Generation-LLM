Creating more inclusive public policies for physically disabled ethnically full African Americans requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Inclusive Policy Making: Ensure that individuals with disabilities are included in policy-making processes through mechanisms such as advisory committees, citizen juries, or participatory budgeting. This will help ensure that policies reflect the needs and priorities of the community.
2. Accessibility Standards: Develop and enforce accessibility standards for public spaces, buildings, and services to ensure that they are accessible to individuals with disabilities. This can include things like wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio signals for emergency alerts.
3. Education and Awareness: Implement education and awareness campaigns to promote disability inclusion and challenge ableism in society. This can include workshops, training programs, and public events that raise awareness about disability rights and inclusion.
4. Employment Opportunities: Create employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities by providing job training and placement services, as well as making workplaces more accessible. This can include things like flexible work arrangements, telecommuting options, and accommodations such as sign language interpreters or braille documents.
5. Healthcare Access: Ensure that individuals with disabilities have access to quality healthcare services by providing accessible facilities, equipment, and staff training on disability-related issues. This can include things like wheelchair-accessible exam rooms, Braille labels on medical equipment, and trained interpreters for patients who are deaf or hard of hearing.
6. Transportation Access: Improve transportation options for individuals with disabilities by providing accessible public transportation services, such as wheelchair-accessible buses and trains, and training for drivers on how to assist passengers with disabilities.
7. Housing Accessibility: Ensure that housing is accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing incentives for landlords to make necessary modifications, such as installing grab bars or widening doorways, and enforcing accessibility standards for new construction.
8. Social Inclusion: Promote social inclusion by creating opportunities for individuals with disabilities to participate in community activities
