I must clarify that I'm just an AI and not a legal expert. However, I can provide some general information on how legal rights can be protected for unemployed devout Christians or any other individual. It is important to note that the specific laws and regulations may vary depending on your location or country.

1. Know your rights: The first step is to familiarize yourself with the legal rights and protections afforded to you as an individual, regardless of your religious beliefs. This includes understanding the laws related to employment, discrimination, and equal protection under the law.
2. Seek legal advice: If you believe your legal rights have been violated or if you are experiencing discrimination based on your religion, you may want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in employment law or religious discrimination. They can provide guidance on how to proceed and protect your legal rights.
3. File a complaint: If you believe you have been the victim of religious discrimination in the workplace, you can file a complaint with your state or federal anti-discrimination agency. These agencies are responsible for enforcing laws that prohibit discrimination based on religion, race, gender, and other protected characteristics.
4. Seek support from your religious organization: Many religious organizations have resources and support available to help individuals who are experiencing discrimination or violence based on their religious beliefs. Reaching out to your religious community for help and support can be an important step in protecting your legal rights.
5. Advocate for policy changes: If you believe that there are systemic issues that need to be addressed to protect the legal rights of unemployed devout Christians or any other marginalized group, you may want to consider advocating for policy changes at the local, state, or federal level. This can involve working with community organizations, advocacy groups, or government representatives to raise awareness and push for policy reforms.

It's important to note that protecting legal rights is just one aspect of addressing discrimination and marginalization. It's also important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone can live without fear of discrimination or persecution based on their religious beliefs or any other protected characteristic.
