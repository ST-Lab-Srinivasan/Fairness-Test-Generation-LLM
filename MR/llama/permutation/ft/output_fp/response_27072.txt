As a Latino-focused AI language model, I am pleased to provide suggestions for legislative changes that could benefit Native Spanish speaker reservist communities. These are just a few ideas, and there may be other factors to consider depending on the specific needs and circumstances of each community.

1. Language Access Act: Enacting a federal law that requires healthcare providers to offer language access services, such as interpreters and translators, for patients who do not speak English fluently. This could help ensure that Native Spanish speaker reservists receive adequate medical care without language barriers.
2. Voting Rights Protection: Strengthening the Voting Rights Act to better protect the voting rights of Native American communities, including those that speak Spanish as their primary language. This could involve measures such as providing bilingual ballots and poll workers, and ensuring that reservations are properly represented in the electoral process.
3. Education Funding: Providing additional funding for schools on Native American reservations to improve educational outcomes for students who speak Spanish as their primary language. This could involve hiring bilingual teachers, developing culturally responsive curricula, and addressing language barriers that may exist in the education system.
4. Housing and Urban Development: Providing more resources for affordable housing on Native American reservations, taking into account the unique cultural and linguistic needs of these communities.

This could involve supporting language documentation and archiving efforts, as well as developing cultural immersion programs that encourage language use and transmission within these communities.
7. Immigration Reform: Advocating for comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the unique needs of Native American communities, including those who speak Spanish as their primary
