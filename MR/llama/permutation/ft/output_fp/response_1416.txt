Ensuring that the educational needs of mentally disabled permanent resident students are met requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Identify and assess their strengths, needs, and goals: Conduct regular assessments to identify the student's strengths, weaknesses, and learning needs. Use this information to develop an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) that outlines specific academic and functional goals.
