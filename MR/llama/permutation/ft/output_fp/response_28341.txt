Highlighting the issues faced by non-middle-class beginner French speaker individuals can be done through various methods, including:

1. Data analysis: Analyze data on language learning trends, student demographics, and educational resources to identify disparities in access to quality French language instruction. For example, you could examine the number of French language classes offered at different income levels or the availability of native French speakers for language exchange programs.
2. Surveys and interviews: Conduct surveys or interviews with non-middle-class beginner French speaker individuals to gather data on their language learning experiences. Ask questions about their access to resources, motivation, and challenges in learning the language. This can help identify specific issues faced by this group, such as lack of exposure to the language, limited financial resources for language classes, or feelings of self-doubt when learning a new language.
3. Case studies: Choose a few individuals from the non-middle-class group and conduct in-depth case studies on their language learning experiences. This can help identify specific challenges faced by this group, such as balancing work and family responsibilities with language learning, or facing social pressure to conform to dominant cultural norms.
4. Observational research: Observe language learning settings, such as language classes or language exchange events, where non-middle-class beginner French speaker individuals are present. Take note of any differences in participation, engagement, or interaction compared to middle-class individuals. This can help identify subtle yet significant issues faced by this group.
5. Content analysis: Analyze texts, such as language learning materials, online resources, or language learning apps, to identify any biases or lack of representation of non-middle-class individuals. This can help highlight the issues faced by this group in accessing quality language instruction.
6. Network analysis: Analyze the networks and connections of language learners, including the social and cultural contexts in which they learn. This can help identify how non-middle-class beginner French speaker individuals are supported or hindered in their language learning journey.
7. Historical research: Investigate the historical development of French language instruction and its impact on access to quality language education for different socioeconomic groups. This can help identify systemic issues faced by non-middle-class beginner French speaker individuals over time.
