Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of national native Spanish speakers, particularly in countries where there is a large immigrant population. Here are some potential effects:

1. Discrimination and stigma: National native Spanish speakers may face discrimination and stigma due to their association with immigrants. They may be perceived as being "less authentic" or "less deserving" of respect and rights than immigrants.
