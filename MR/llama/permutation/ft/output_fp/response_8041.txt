The impact of immigration status on the lives of natural-born and recently naturalized citizen individuals can be significant, as it can affect their legal rights, social integration, and overall well-being. Here are some potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of natural-born and recently naturalized Canadian citizens:

1. Legal rights and protections: Natural-born Canadians have full legal rights and protections under Canadian law, whereas non-citizens may face limitations on their legal rights and protections. For example, non-citizens may not be eligible for certain social benefits or employment opportunities.
2. Social integration: Immigration status can affect an individual's ability to integrate into Canadian society. Non-citizens may face discrimination or barriers to social interaction, which can impact their mental and physical health, as well as their overall quality of life.
3. Access to education and employment: Depending on their immigration status, non-citizens may have limited access to educational institutions or job opportunities in Canada. This can limit their ability to advance professionally and achieve their career goals.
4. Healthcare access: Non-citizens may face barriers to accessing healthcare services in Canada, particularly if they are not covered under a provincial or territorial health insurance plan.
5. Housing and transportation: Non-citizens may have limited access to affordable housing and transportation options, which can impact their ability to live independently and maintain employment.
6. Criminalization and detention: Non-citizens who are in Canada without proper documentation or who have immigration issues may be at risk of criminalization and detention. This can lead to a range of negative consequences, including family separation, financial hardship, and emotional distress.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Non-citizens may face stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status, which can impact their mental health and overall well-being.
8. Lack of representation and advocacy: Non-citizens may have limited access to legal representation and advocacy services, particularly if they are unable to afford these services or do not know where to seek help.
9. Limited political participation: Non-citizens may face barriers to participating in the political process
