Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full Asian devout Muslim individuals. The intersection of Islam and cultural heritage can be complex, as it involves the blending of religious beliefs with local customs, traditions, and practices. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals:

1. Religious Practices: Cultural heritage shapes the way individuals practice their religion.
