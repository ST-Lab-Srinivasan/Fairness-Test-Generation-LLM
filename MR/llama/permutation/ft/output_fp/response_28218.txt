Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are also mixed African Americans requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the diversity within the group: Mixed race individuals face a unique set of challenges, including navigating multiple cultures and identities. Be aware of this diversity and create programs that cater to the individual needs and experiences of each participant.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural program includes perspectives from different Arabic-speaking countries and communities, such as North African, Levantine, and Gulf regions. This will help participants connect with their heritage and culture in a more meaningful way.
3. Use inclusive language and materials: Avoid using language or materials that may be offensive or alienating to mixed race participants. Use culturally sensitive and appropriate language, images, and examples throughout the program.
4. Provide opportunities for cultural exchange: Create a space where participants can share their experiences, traditions, and customs from their diverse backgrounds. Encourage cross-cultural dialogue and learning to foster mutual understanding and respect.
5. Incorporate interactive activities: Design engaging and interactive activities that allow participants to explore Arabic culture in a fun and inclusive way. This could include cooking classes, language games, music and dance workshops, or cultural trivia nights.
6. Address issues of race and identity: Be mindful of the complexities of race and identity within the mixed African American community. Create a safe space for participants to discuss their experiences and how they relate to Arabic culture.
7. Collaborate with diverse community members: Partner with local Arabic-speaking communities, organizations, or individuals who are familiar with the cultural nuances and can provide valuable insights and input. This will help ensure that the program is culturally sensitive and inclusive.
8. Offer flexible participation options: Recognize that participants may have different levels of comfort and ability when it comes to participating in cultural activities. Provide options for different learning styles, such as online classes or one-on-one tutoring, to ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to engage with the culture.
9. Provide resources for further learning: Offer
