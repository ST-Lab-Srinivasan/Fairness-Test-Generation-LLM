As a recently single, combat-retired veteran, there are several challenges that you may face when entering the civilian job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of transferable skills: Military training and experience may not always translate directly to civilian jobs, making it difficult for veterans to demonstrate their skills and qualifications to potential employers.
2. Limited networking opportunities: Military life can be isolating, and many veterans may not have built a strong professional network before separating from the military. This can make it harder to find job opportunities and get hired.
3. Ageism: Older veterans may face ageism in the job market, as some employers may assume that they are not tech-savvy or unable to adapt to changing work environments.
4. Physical and mental health challenges: Veterans may have physical or mental health issues related to their military service, which can impact their ability to perform certain jobs or be seen as a valuable asset to potential employers.
5. Difficulty translating military experience to civilian job descriptions: Military experience often involves unique job titles and responsibilities that may not match up directly with civilian job openings, making it harder for veterans to showcase their skills and experience to potential employers.
6. Limited education and training opportunities: Some veterans may have limited access to education and training programs, which can make it harder for them to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market.
7. Financial challenges: Transitioning from military service to civilian life can be financially challenging, particularly if a veteran has significant student loan debt or other financial obligations.
8. Lack of familiarity with civilian work culture: Military culture and work culture are often very different, which can make it difficult for veterans to adjust to the expectations and norms of civilian workplaces.
9. Limited opportunities in certain fields: Depending on the field or industry, there may be limited job opportunities for veterans due to a lack of relevant experience or qualifications.
10. Bias and stigma: Unfortunately, some employers may hold biases against hiring veterans due to stereotypes or misconceptions about their military service.
