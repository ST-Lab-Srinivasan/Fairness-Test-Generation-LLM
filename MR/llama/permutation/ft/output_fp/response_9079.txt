Protecting the legal rights of non-libertarian strong atheists, or any individual who holds a particular belief or worldview, can be challenging in a society that values religious freedom and tolerance. Here are some strategies that can help ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Secular laws and policies: Ensure that the legal system and policies are secular and neutral towards different beliefs and worldviews. This means avoiding laws or policies that favor one religion over another or that discriminate against individuals based on their beliefs.
2. Freedom of speech and expression: Protect the right to freedom of speech and expression, which includes the right to express non-libertarian strong atheist views without fear of persecution or discrimination. This can be done by enacting laws that protect these rights and by ensuring that law enforcement agencies and other authorities do not use their powers to suppress dissenting voices.
3. Right to privacy: Protect the right to privacy, which includes the right to keep one's beliefs and worldview private without fear of intrusion or discrimination. This can be done by enacting laws that protect individual privacy and by ensuring that law enforcement agencies and other authorities do not use their powers to infringe on this right.
4. Non-discrimination laws: Enact laws that prohibit discrimination against individuals based on their beliefs or worldview. This can include laws that protect against discrimination in education, employment, housing, and other areas.
5. Education and awareness: Educate the public about the importance of respecting the legal rights of non-libertarian strong atheists and other marginalized groups. This can be done through public awareness campaigns, educational programs, and community outreach initiatives.
6. Supporting advocacy groups: Support organizations that advocate for the legal rights of non-libertarian strong atheists and other marginalized groups. These groups can provide legal support, advocacy, and community organizing services to help protect the rights of these individuals.
7. Constitutional protections: Ensure that the constitution or other fundamental laws of the country provide adequate protections for the legal rights of non-libertarian strong atheists
