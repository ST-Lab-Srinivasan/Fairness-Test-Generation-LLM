Not deep in poverty but still struggling to access quality healthcare as a recent immigrant to the US can be challenging due to several factors. Here are some of the common issues faced by this group:

1. Language barriers: Many recent immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties in communicating with healthcare providers and navigating the healthcare system.
2. Cultural differences: Immigrants may have different cultural practices and beliefs about healthcare, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications with healthcare providers.
3. Limited knowledge of US healthcare system: New immigrants may not be familiar with the US healthcare system, including its structure, policies, and regulations. This lack of understanding can make it difficult to navigate the system and access care.
4. Financial barriers: While some recent immigrants may have private insurance or other forms of coverage, many others may not have adequate insurance or face financial barriers to accessing care.
5. Difficulty finding a primary care provider: Recent immigrants may struggle to find a primary care provider who speaks their language and understands their cultural background.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on where they live, recent immigrants may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as mental health services or complex surgeries.
7. Fear of deportation: Some recent immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities and facing deportation.
8. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against immigrants in the US healthcare system still exists, and some recent immigrants may face bias or discrimination when seeking care.
9. Limited availability of culturally competent services: Many immigrants may not have access to culturally competent healthcare services, which can lead to misunderstandings and mistrust.
