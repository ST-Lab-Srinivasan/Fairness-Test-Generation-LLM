Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Jewish recent immigrants to Canada requires understanding their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some strategies to help make these programs more welcoming:

1. Understand the diversity of Jewish identity: Secular Jewish immigrants may not identify with traditional religious practices or beliefs, but they still have a strong connection to Judaism and its culture. Be sensitive to this diverse range of identities and experiences.
2. Incorporate a variety of perspectives: Include programming that reflects the diverse backgrounds and experiences of secular Jewish immigrants. This could include art, music, literature, and other cultural expressions that are meaningful to them.
3. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that your cultural programs are accessible and inclusive for everyone, regardless of their level of religious observance or identity.
