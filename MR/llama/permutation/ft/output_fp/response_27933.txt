Mentorship can play a significant role in the development and well-being of older adults, particularly those in their 90s. As individuals age, they may face various challenges such as cognitive decline, social isolation, and physical limitations, which can impact their mental and emotional health. Mentorship can provide older adults with a sense of purpose, belonging, and connection to others, which are essential for overall well-being. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to the development of very old (90s+) moderate people:

1. Social interaction and support: Older adults may experience social isolation due to declining health or the loss of loved ones. Mentorship can provide an opportunity for social interaction, emotional support, and a sense of belonging, which are critical for maintaining mental and emotional well-being.
2. Cognitive stimulation: Engaging in mentorship activities can help older adults to maintain cognitive function and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Mentoring can provide opportunities for problem-solving, decision-making, and creative thinking, which are important for cognitive health.
3. Emotional support: Older adults may face emotional challenges such as grief, loss, or anxiety. Mentorship can offer a safe space for older adults to express their emotions and receive emotional support from someone who understands their experiences.
4. Networking opportunities: Mentorship can provide older adults with opportunities to connect with other individuals in similar situations, which can help them feel less isolated and more connected to their community.
5. Personal growth and development: Mentorship can encourage older adults to reflect on their experiences, skills, and values, and to identify areas for personal growth and development. This can help them to continue learning and growing throughout their lives.
6. Building confidence and self-esteem: Mentorship can help older adults to build confidence and self-esteem by providing opportunities for success and recognition. This can be particularly important for older adults who may have experienced declining health or loss of identity due to retirement or other life changes.
7. Preserving cultural heritage: Mentorship can provide older adults with the opportunity to share
