Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Hispanic individuals requires a thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the community's needs and interests: Conduct research or surveys to understand the cultural background and preferences of the target audience. This will help you tailor the programs to their specific needs and interests.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural program is inclusive by incorporating perspectives from a variety of cultures, including Hispanic culture. This can be done through the use of diverse materials, such as books, films, music, and art.
3. Provide language support: Offer language support for participants who may not be fluent in Chinese. Provide translations or interpretation services to ensure that everyone can fully participate in the program.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for participants to connect with each other and build relationships. This can be done through group activities, social events, or cultural workshops.
5. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic power dynamics that may affect the target audience. Be sensitive to the ways in which they may have been marginalized or excluded from mainstream cultural programs.
6. Involve community members in the planning process: Engage with local community members and involve them in the planning and implementation of the cultural program. This can help ensure that the program is culturally sensitive and responsive to the needs of the target audience.
7. Offer culturally relevant programming: Develop programs that are relevant to the target audience's cultural background and interests. This can include programs that explore Hispanic culture, as well as programs that introduce Chinese culture in a way that is respectful and inclusive.
8. Provide opportunities for skill-building: Offer workshops or classes that teach skills such as language, music, dance, or art. These skills can help participants connect with their cultural heritage and build a sense of identity and belonging.
9. Create intergenerational connections: Encourage participation from older adults in the community by offering programs that cater to their interests and needs. This can help build connections between different generations and create a more inclusive cultural program.
