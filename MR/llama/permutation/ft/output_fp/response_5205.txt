4. Foster a sense of community: Create an environment where students feel valued and supported, and where they can collaborate and learn from one another.
5. Provide support for students with diverse needs: Offer accommodations and resources that cater to the unique requirements of students with disabilities, learning difficulties, or other challenges.
6. Encourage civic engagement and social responsibility: Teach students about their rights and responsibilities as members of society, and encourage them to participate in community service and advocacy activities.
