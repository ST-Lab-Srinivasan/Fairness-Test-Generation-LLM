5. Builds bridges: Cultural exchange can help build bridges between different ethnic and sexual minority groups by fostering a sense of connection and shared understanding. By working together on cultural projects or initiatives, individuals can develop a sense of solidarity and mutual support.
6. Empowers marginalized communities: Cultural exchange can empower marginalized communities, including those that are partially asexual, by giving them a platform to share their stories and experiences. This can help build confidence and self-esteem within these communities and promote greater visibility and recognition.
