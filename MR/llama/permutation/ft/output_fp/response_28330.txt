Creating more inclusive community programs for native Arabic speakers who are not newly married individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your community programs more inclusive:

1. Understand the needs of the community: Conduct research or surveys to identify the specific needs and interests of the native Arabic speaker population in your area. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their unique requirements.
2. Offer flexible programming options: Provide a range of program options that cater to different age groups, interests, and lifestyles. For example, you could offer programs during the day, evening, or weekends to accommodate various schedules.
3. Promote cultural exchange: Design programs that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange. Organize events where participants can share their cultural practices, traditions, and customs with one another. This will help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
4. Incorporate language classes: Offer language classes specifically tailored to the native Arabic speaker population. This will enable them to communicate more effectively in their local community and beyond.
5. Provide childcare options: Many native Arabic speakers may have young children, so consider offering childcare services during your programs. This will help ensure that parents can participate without worrying about the care of their children.
6. Encourage intergenerational connections: Organize events that bring together different age groups within the community. This could include activities such as mentorship programs, cultural workshops, or social gatherings.
7. Foster community partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and businesses to create a network of support for native Arabic speakers. This can help provide access to additional resources, services, and opportunities within the community.
8. Offer mental health support: Many immigrant communities face unique mental health challenges. Provide counseling services or mental health workshops specifically tailored to the needs of native Arabic speakers.
9. Create a welcoming space: Ensure that your programs and events are held in safe, welcoming spaces that reflect the cultural values and practices of the community. This can help participants feel more comfortable and included.
10. Engage with local leaders: Build relationships with local leaders and community figures to gain support for your initiatives
