Promoting the inclusion of natural-born Canadian citizen temporary visa holder individuals in casual athletes can be achieved through several measures. Here are some suggestions:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops to raise awareness about the challenges faced by temporary visa holders in accessing sports facilities and opportunities. This can help to create a more inclusive environment and encourage more people to get involved.
2. Outreach and Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support immigrant and refugee communities to reach out to these individuals and provide them with information about athletic opportunities. Building partnerships with community groups and sports clubs can help to create a more inclusive environment.
3. Scholarships and Financial Support: Offer scholarships or financial support to temporary visa holders who are interested in participating in sports but may face financial barriers. This can help to reduce the financial burden of participation and make sports more accessible.

7. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair temporary visa holders with experienced athletes or coaches who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement. This can help to build confidence and skills, and promote a sense of belonging.
8. Accessibility and Inclusive Facilities: Ensure that sports facilities are accessible and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve providing accessible changing rooms, showers, and other amenities.
9. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local and national levels to
