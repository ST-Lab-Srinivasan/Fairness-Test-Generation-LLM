As a responsible AI language model, I believe it is essential to ensure that the voices of beginner Spanish speaker lifelong single individuals are heard in decision-making processes. Here are some suggestions on how to achieve this:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Designate specific times and spaces for beginner Spanish speakers to share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or intimidation. This could be through virtual meetings, focus groups, or community events.
