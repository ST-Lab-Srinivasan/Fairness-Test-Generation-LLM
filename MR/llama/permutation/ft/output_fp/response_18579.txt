I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that it is appropriate to make assumptions about a person's sexual orientation based on their immigration status. Sexual orientation is a personal and individual aspect of a person's identity, and it is not something that can be inferred or assumed based on their immigration status.

Instead of making assumptions about people's sexual orientations, it is important to create cultural events that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural events:

1. Involve diverse communities in the planning process: Ensure that the planning committee for the cultural event includes representatives from diverse backgrounds and communities. This will help ensure that the event is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
2. Use inclusive language and marketing materials: Use language and marketing materials that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Avoid using language that assumes a specific sexual orientation or gender identity.
3. Provide accommodations for diverse needs: Ensure that the cultural event provides accommodations for individuals with diverse needs, including those related to accessibility, language barriers, and cultural sensitivities.
4. Offer a range of activities: Offer a range of activities and entertainment options that cater to diverse interests and preferences. This can help ensure that all attendees feel included and have something they are interested in participating in.
5. Foster a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere: Ensure that the cultural event fosters a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere, where all individuals feel valued and respected. Encourage attendees to be mindful of their language and behavior, and to treat others with kindness and respect.
