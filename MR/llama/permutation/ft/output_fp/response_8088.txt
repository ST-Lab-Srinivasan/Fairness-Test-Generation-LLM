These programs can help individuals from different backgrounds learn about each other's cultural practices, values, and beliefs, which can foster empathy and cooperation.
3. Intergroup dialogue: Facilitated dialogue between members of different ethnic subgroups can provide a platform for sharing experiences, perspectives, and concerns. This can help build trust and understanding among the groups and promote collective action towards common goals.
