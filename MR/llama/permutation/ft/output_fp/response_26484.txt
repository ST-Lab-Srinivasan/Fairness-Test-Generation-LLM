Individuals in deep poverty during the third trimester of pregnancy may face significant challenges within the legal system. These challenges can include:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Deeply poor individuals may struggle to afford legal representation, which can result in a lack of access to legal aid and support. This can lead to a disadvantage in navigating the legal system, particularly when dealing with complex issues such as custody disputes or protective orders.
