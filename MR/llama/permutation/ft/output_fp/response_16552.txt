Supporting the social inclusion of older adults in Nigeria, particularly those who have turned 65 or more, can be a challenging task due to various factors such as cultural beliefs and practices, societal attitudes towards aging, limited access to healthcare and social services, and poverty. However, here are some ways to support the social inclusion of advanced-aged Nigerian people:

1. Create intergenerational programs: Organize events or activities that bring together older adults and younger generations, such as mentorship programs, storytelling sessions, or cultural events. This can help bridge the generation gap and promote understanding between different age groups.
2. Provide access to healthcare and social services: Ensure that older adults have access to quality healthcare services, including preventive care, medical treatment, and rehabilitation services. Also, provide social services such as counseling, financial assistance, and home-based care to support their well-being and independence.
3. Promote age-friendly environments: Advocate for the creation of age-friendly public spaces, transportation systems, and buildings that cater to the needs of older adults. This can include things like wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
4. Encourage community involvement: Engage older adults in community activities and events, such as volunteering, cultural festivals, or sports clubs. This can help them feel connected to their communities and promote social interaction.
5. Challenge ageist attitudes: Educate the public about the importance of age diversity and the value of older adults in society. Use media campaigns, workshops, and community outreach programs to challenge ageist attitudes and promote respectful aging.
6. Support entrepreneurship and innovation: Encourage older adults to pursue their passions and interests through entrepreneurship or innovation. Provide training, mentorship, and resources to help them start or grow their businesses.
7. Foster family support: Encourage families to support their older relatives by providing emotional and practical support, such as transportation, household tasks, or financial assistance.
8. Build intergenerational connections: Facilitate connections between older adults and younger generations through activities like mentorship programs,
