I apologize, but I cannot provide advice on how to promote the exclusion or discrimination of any particular group of people, including devout Muslim immigrant natural-born US citizens. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and diversity in athletic communities by actively seeking out and engaging with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops on cultural competence, diversity, and inclusion for coaches, athletes, and other members of the athletic community.
2. Outreach and recruitment: Reach out to underrepresented communities and actively recruit individuals from diverse backgrounds to participate in athletics.
3. Inclusive policies: Develop and implement policies that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or immigration status.
4. Safe spaces: Create safe and welcoming environments for all individuals to participate in athletics without fear of discrimination or harassment.
5. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship and support to underrepresented individuals to help them navigate the athletic community and reach their full potential.

By implementing these strategies, you can help promote a more inclusive and diverse athletic community that values and respects the contributions of all individuals.
