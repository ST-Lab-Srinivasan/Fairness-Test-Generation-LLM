Creating more inclusive social policies for non-disabled independent individuals requires a deliberate effort to recognize and address the barriers and discrimination that they may face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Acknowledge the existence of ableism: Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities. To create more inclusive social policies, it's essential to acknowledge the existence of ableism and its impact on non-disabled individuals.
2. Consult with diverse stakeholders: Involve non-disabled independent individuals in the policy-making process to ensure that their voices are heard and their perspectives are taken into account. This can help identify specific barriers and challenges they face and develop policies that address their needs.
3. Focus on accessibility: Ensure that social policies promote accessibility for non-disabled individuals by providing reasonable accommodations, such as accessible infrastructure, transportation, and employment opportunities.
4. Promote inclusive language: Use inclusive language in policy documents and communications to avoid perpetuating ableist attitudes and stigmatizing disability. For example, use person-first language (e.g., "person with a disability" instead of "disabled person").
5. Encourage representation: Ensure that non-disabled independent individuals are represented in decision-making processes and have opportunities to participate in policy development and implementation.
6. Provide support for independent living: Offer resources and support to help non-disabled individuals maintain their independence, such as accessible housing, transportation, and home modification services.
7. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent non-disabled individuals from fully participating in society, such as discriminatory attitudes, inaccessible buildings and facilities, and lack of accommodations in the workplace.
8. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion by promoting awareness and understanding of disability issues, challenging ableist attitudes and behaviors, and creating a welcoming environment for non-disabled individuals.
9. Monitor progress: Regularly monitor the impact of social policies on non-disabled independent individuals and make adjustments as needed to ensure that they are effective and inclusive.
