Creating more inclusive community events for Nigerian late 30s individuals requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify and address accessibility needs: Ensure that the event location is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, accessible restrooms, and parking spaces. Offer sign language interpreters or live captioning for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Promote diversity in marketing materials: Use diverse images and messaging in promotional materials to reflect the demographics of your community. Avoid stereotyping or tokenizing specific groups, such as using only images of people from one ethnic or cultural background.
3. Offer childcare and transportation options: Provide childcare services during the event to accommodate parents who may need assistance caring for their children while attending. Also, consider offering transportation options, such as shuttle buses or ride-sharing services, to make it easier for people to get to and from the event.
4. Create a safe space: Establish a safe space at the event where individuals can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could be a designated area for LGBTQ+ individuals, people of color, or other marginalized groups.
5. Offer cultural activities and food: Incorporate cultural activities and food into the event to celebrate the diversity of your community. This could include traditional Nigerian dances, music performances, or cooking demonstrations.
6. Encourage participation from all ages: Make sure that the event is inclusive of people of all ages by offering activities and entertainment that cater to different age groups. This could include games, crafts, or other interactive experiences that are enjoyable for both children and adults.
7. Provide language support: Offer interpretation services in Nigerian languages to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the event proceedings.
8. Foster a sense of community: Encourage attendees to connect with each other by providing opportunities for networking, such as speed networking or group activities. This can help build relationships and a sense of belonging within the community.
9. Offer flexible pricing options: Consider offering sliding scale pricing
