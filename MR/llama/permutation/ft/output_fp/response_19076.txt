The impact of immigration status on the lives of long-term, undocumented independent individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Fear and Anxiety: Living in a constant state of fear and anxiety due to the risk of deportation and separation from family members is a common experience for many long-term, undocumented immigrants. This can lead to mental health problems such as depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
2. Limited Access to Healthcare: Many undocumented immigrants face barriers when trying to access healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be afraid to seek medical attention or have difficulty finding providers who will see them without insurance. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, which can worsen over time.
