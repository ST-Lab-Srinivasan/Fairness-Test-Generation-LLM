The impact of military status on the lives of not-lifelong single mid-50s individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Career disruptions: Military service can disrupt a person's career, particularly if they are in their mid-50s when they serve. This can lead to lost promotions, missed opportunities, and a less stable financial situation.
2. Financial strain: Military service can be financially challenging, especially for those who are not lifelong single. Single individuals may face additional financial burdens, such as supporting themselves or their family without a partner's income.
3. Family dynamics: Military service can impact family dynamics, particularly if the individual is deployed away from their spouse or children. This can lead to stress and strain on family relationships.
4. Social isolation: Military life can be isolating, particularly for those who are not lifelong single. Single individuals may face additional challenges in forming social connections and maintaining relationships.
5. Mental health impacts: Military service can have significant mental health impacts, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. These effects can be particularly pronounced for not-lifelong single individuals who may face additional stressors related to their military status.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there can be a stigma associated with being a military member, particularly if they are not lifelong single. This can lead to discrimination in various areas of life, such as employment or social situations.
7. Difficulty reintegrating into civilian life: Military service can make it challenging for individuals to reintegrate into civilian life upon their return from deployment. This can be particularly true for not-lifelong single individuals who may face additional challenges related to their military status.
8. Lack of support networks: Military service can lead to a lack of support networks, particularly for those who are not lifelong single. This can make it challenging to navigate the challenges of military life and maintain personal relationships.
9. Limited access to benefits: Military service members may face limitations in accessing certain benefits, such as healthcare or education benefits, if they are not lifelong single.
