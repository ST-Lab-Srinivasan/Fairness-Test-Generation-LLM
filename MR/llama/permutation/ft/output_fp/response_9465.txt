Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native French speakers, particularly those who identify as progressive. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes their perspectives and behaviors:

1. Sense of identity: Cultural heritage is an important aspect of a person's identity, and for native French speakers, it can shape their sense of self and belonging. They may feel a strong connection to their cultural traditions and practices, which can influence their values, beliefs, and behaviors.
2. Respect for tradition: Progressive native French speakers often have a deep respect for their cultural heritage, even as they challenge traditional norms and practices. This can manifest in a desire to preserve and promote cultural traditions while also adapting them to contemporary society.
3. Understanding of social hierarchy: Cultural heritage can provide native French speakers with a nuanced understanding of social hierarchy and power dynamics. By examining the ways in which cultural practices have been shaped by historical events, social norms, and economic systems, they may be able to better understand how these factors influence their own lives and communities.
4. Appreciation for diversity: Progressive native French speakers often appreciate the diversity of cultures and perspectives that exist within their own culture and community. This can manifest in a desire to celebrate and learn from other cultures, while also challenging dominant narratives and power structures.
5. Critique of cultural appropriation: Native French speakers may be critical of cultural appropriation, or the act of adopting elements of another culture without proper understanding, respect, or compensation. They may see this as a form of exploitation or oppression, particularly when it involves cultures that have been historically marginalized or oppressed.
6. Engagement with social and political issues: Progressive native French speakers may be actively engaged in social and political issues affecting their community, such as inequality, discrimination, and social justice. They may see their cultural heritage as a source of strength and inspiration for these efforts.
7. Nostalgia and longing: For some native French speakers, cultural heritage can evoke feelings of nostalgia and longing for a past that they feel was lost or suppressed. This can be particularly true for individuals who have experienced cultural erasure
