The role of cultural heritage can vary greatly among individuals, depending on their personal experiences and identities. For natural-born Indian citizen mixed-Caucasian heritage people, cultural heritage can play a complex and multifaceted role in their lives. Here are some possible ways:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a community or group, regardless of the individual's racial or ethnic background. Mixed-heritage individuals may feel connected to both Indian and Caucasian cultures, and they may find themselves navigating between these two cultures in their daily lives.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity, particularly during formative years of childhood and adolescence. Mixed-heritage individuals may struggle to reconcile their multiple cultural identities, leading to questions of identity, belonging, and self-esteem.
3. Intersectionality: For mixed-heritage individuals, cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. This intersectionality can lead to unique experiences of discrimination, privilege, or marginalization, depending on the individual's various identities.
4. Cultural exchange: Mixed-heritage individuals may experience cultural exchange between their Indian and Caucasian cultures, leading to a richer understanding of both cultures. They may also learn about cultural practices, traditions, and values that they would not have encountered otherwise.
5. Resilience and adaptability: Navigating between multiple cultural identities can build resilience and adaptability in mixed-heritage individuals. They may develop strategies to manage competing cultural demands and find ways to integrate their diverse heritages into their daily lives.
6. Cultural pride: Mixed-heritage individuals may experience a sense of cultural pride in both their Indian and Caucasian cultures, which can be a source of strength and inspiration. They may also feel proud of their unique cultural identity, which blends elements from two or more cultures.
7. Challenges to cultural preservation: Mixed-heritage individuals may face challenges in preserving their cultural heritage, particularly if they are not part of the dominant culture. They may encounter language barriers
