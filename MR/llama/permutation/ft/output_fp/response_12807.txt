Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of elderly male individuals, particularly those who are beginners in learning Chinese. As the population ages and the number of older adults increases, it is essential to understand how marital status affects this group's language learning experience. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Chinese speaker elderly male individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect an individual's language learning experience in various ways. For example, married individuals may have more opportunities to practice their target language outside of the classroom due to their social interactions with their spouse and children (Kim, 2015). On the other hand, widowed or divorced individuals may face challenges in finding language learning partners due to their social isolation (Liu & Zhang, 2016). Additionally, research has shown that older adults who are married tend to have better cognitive functioning and a lower risk of dementia compared to those who are not married (Fratiglione et al., 2014).

Methodology:
This study will investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Chinese speaker elderly male individuals. The sample size will consist of 30 participants, aged 65 and above, who are enrolled in a Chinese language learning program at a local community center. Participants will be recruited through posters and flyers distributed at the center and surrounding communities.

Data Collection:
Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews with participants. The interview questions will focus on participants' marital status, social interactions, language learning experiences, and overall well-being. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Data Analysis:
The data will be analyzed using thematic analysis. The interviews will be transcribed and the content will be analyzed based on the themes that emerge from the data. The findings will be organized into categories and subcategories, and the quotes will be attached to each category.

Expected Results:
The results of this study are expected to show that marital status has a significant impact on the language learning experience of elderly male individuals. Specifically, married participants are expected to have better language
