Disability can have significant impacts on the lives of permanent resident freedom advocates, including:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face barriers in accessing social and community activities, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Discrimination and lack of accommodations can limit the educational and career opportunities for people with disabilities, hindering their ability to fully participate in society.
3. Health disparities: People with disabilities may face discrimination in healthcare settings, leading to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can exacerbate their conditions.
4. Increased poverty and economic insecurity: Disability can lead to increased poverty and economic insecurity due to barriers in accessing employment and other resources.
5. Lack of representation and voice: People with disabilities may lack representation and a voice in decision-making processes, leading to policies and practices that do not adequately address their needs.
6. Stigma and negative attitudes: Disability can lead to stigmatization and negative attitudes from society, which can further marginalize and isolate individuals with disabilities.
7. Limited access to transportation: People with disabilities may face barriers in accessing transportation, limiting their ability to participate fully in society.
8. Inadequate support services: Disability can lead to a lack of access to support services such as home care, personal care attendants, and assistive technology, hindering an individual's ability to live independently.
9. Limited access to cultural and recreational activities: People with disabilities may face barriers in accessing cultural and recreational activities, leading to a lack of opportunities for socialization and personal growth.
10. Increased risk of violence and abuse: Disability can increase the risk of violence and abuse, particularly for women and children with disabilities.

It's important to recognize that these impacts are not inherent to disability but rather a result of societal barriers and discrimination. By working towards creating an inclusive and accessible society, we can reduce the impacts of disability on the lives of permanent resident freedom advocates and promote full participation and equality for all.
