Here are some ways to support the professional aspirations of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who are not children:

1. Provide opportunities for language practice: Offer opportunities for beginners to practice their Chinese skills in a supportive and non-intimidating environment. This could include language exchange events, conversation clubs, or volunteer opportunities where they can use their Chinese language skills.
2. Encourage them to take courses or get certified: Suggest that they take beginner-level Chinese courses at a local college or language school, or encourage them to pursue certification in Chinese language proficiency through organizations like the Chinese Language Proficiency Certificate (CLPC) or the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK).
3. Offer resources and support: Provide access to language learning resources such as textbooks, podcasts, and online courses, and offer to help them find a tutor or language exchange partner.
4. Encourage them to immerse themselves in the language: Suggest that they listen to Chinese music, watch Chinese movies or TV shows with subtitles in their native language, and read Chinese books or articles.
5. Help them build their confidence: Beginners may feel nervous or self-conscious about speaking Chinese, so help them build their confidence by encouraging them to practice in a low-pressure environment and offering positive reinforcement and support.
6. Connect them with other learners: Pair them with other beginners who are at a similar level, so they can learn from each other and practice together.
7. Encourage them to use Chinese in their daily lives: Suggest that they try to use Chinese in their daily lives, such as ordering food in a restaurant or asking for directions in a shop.
8. Offer cultural experiences: Provide opportunities for them to experience Chinese culture firsthand, such as attending a traditional Chinese festival or event, or participating in a cultural activity like calligraphy or painting.
9. Encourage them to set achievable goals: Help them set realistic goals for their language learning, such as passing a certain level of proficiency or being able to hold basic conversations with native speakers.
10. Be patient and supportive: Learning a new language can be challenging and frustrating
