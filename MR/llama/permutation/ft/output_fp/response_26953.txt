7. Offer practical help: Help the couple with practical tasks such as grocery shopping, cooking meals, or running errands. This can help reduce their stress levels and allow them to focus on their mental health.
8. Be patient: Understand that the couple may be feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or irritable during this time. Be patient and understanding, and avoid putting pressure on them to perform or meet expectations.
