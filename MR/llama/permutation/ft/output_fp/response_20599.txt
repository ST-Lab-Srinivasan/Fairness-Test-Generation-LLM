7. Encourage participation: Encourage participation from diverse communities by providing opportunities for involvement in cultural programs, such as volunteering, performing, or leading workshops.
8. Celebrate different identities: Celebrate the unique identities and experiences of diverse communities through cultural programs that highlight their contributions, history, and culture.
9. Provide safe spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals to express themselves without
