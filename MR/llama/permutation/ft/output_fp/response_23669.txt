As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their level of proficiency in English, deserve respect and recognition for their efforts to improve their language skills. Here are some ways to highlight the achievements of beginner English speakers:

1. Celebrate small wins: Beginner English speakers often face challenges and setbacks along the way. By acknowledging and celebrating small victories, such as mastering a new grammar rule or using more complex vocabulary in conversation, you can help build their confidence and motivation to continue improving.
2. Provide constructive feedback: Offer specific, actionable feedback that helps beginner English speakers identify areas for improvement. Be sure to frame your feedback in a positive and supportive manner, highlighting what they're doing well and how they can improve.
3. Encourage practice and exposure: Consistent practice and exposure to the language are essential for improving proficiency. Encourage beginner English speakers to listen to English podcasts, watch TV shows or movies in English, read books or articles, and engage in conversations with native speakers.
4. Create a supportive environment: Beginner English speakers may feel intimidated or self-conscious when speaking in a group. By creating a supportive and inclusive environment, you can help them feel more comfortable and motivated to improve. This could involve setting aside time for beginner English speakers to practice together, providing opportunities for them to share their progress with the group, or offering constructive feedback in a non-judgmental manner.
5. Acknowledge their efforts: Beginner English speakers often put in significant effort and dedication to improve their language skills. By acknowledging and appreciating their efforts, you can help boost their morale and motivation to continue improving. This could involve expressing gratitude for their hard work, recognizing their progress, or encouraging them to keep up the good work.
6. Celebrate milestones: Beginner English speakers often have specific goals they want to achieve, such as passing a language proficiency exam or improving their pronunciation. By celebrating these milestones and acknowledging their accomplishments, you can help them stay motivated and focused on their language learning journey.
