As a beginner Arabic speaker, Nigerian people may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in Nigeria or other Arabic-speaking countries. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Language Barrier: The biggest challenge faced by beginner Arabic speakers is the language barrier. Arabic is a complex language with its own grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, which can be difficult to learn and understand, especially for Nigerian people who are not familiar with the language.
2. Cultural Differences: The legal system in Arabic-speaking countries is rooted in Islamic law and culture, which may differ significantly from the legal system in Nigeria. For example, in some Arabic-speaking countries, Shariah law is enforced alongside civil law, while in Nigeria, there is a separate legal system for Muslims.
3. Limited Access to Legal Resources: In many Arabic-speaking countries, legal resources such as textbooks, legal dictionaries, and online resources may not be readily available or accessible to beginner Arabic speakers. This can make it difficult for them to learn and understand the legal system.
4. Lack of Trust: Beginner Arabic speakers may struggle to build trust with legal professionals who are not fluent in Arabic. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and a lack of confidence in the legal system.
5. Limited Legal Education: In Nigeria, there is limited education on Islamic law and the legal system in Arabic-speaking countries. As a result, beginner Arabic speakers may not have the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate the legal system effectively.
6. Different Legal Terminology: The legal terminology used in Arabic-speaking countries may be unfamiliar to beginner Arabic speakers. For example, terms such as "Shariah," "Fiqh," and "Hadith" may not be familiar to Nigerian people who are not versed in Islamic law.
7. Lack of Support: Beginner Arabic speakers may feel isolated and lack support when navigating the legal system in an Arabic-speaking country. This can be particularly challenging for women, children, and other marginalized groups who may face additional barriers and discrimination.
