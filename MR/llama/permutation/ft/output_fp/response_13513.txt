Native Chinese speakers may face various challenges in the healthcare system, particularly when they are not proficient in English or other dominant languages used in medical settings. Some of the common challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Limited proficiency in the dominant language used in healthcare settings can create communication barriers between patients and healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and delayed or inadequate treatment.
