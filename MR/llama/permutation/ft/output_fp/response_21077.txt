Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Orthodox Jewish non-lower-class individuals requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Understand the community: It's essential to understand the needs, preferences, and values of the target audience. Conduct research or consult with members of the Orthodox Jewish community to gain insights into their cultural practices and expectations.
2. Offer a variety of programs: Provide a range of cultural programs that cater to different interests and preferences within the community. For example, offer traditional music and dance workshops for those interested in preserving cultural heritage, or provide modern art exhibitions for those who are open to exploring new forms of expression.
3. Make accessibility a priority: Ensure that all programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial means or level of observance. Offer free or low-cost events, and make accommodations for those with disabilities or mobility issues.
4. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage the participation of older community members by involving them in the planning and execution of cultural programs. This can help preserve traditional practices and share knowledge between generations.
5. Emphasize community engagement: Create opportunities for the community to come together and engage in cultural activities, such as group singing or dancing classes. This will foster a sense of belonging and encourage social interaction within the community.
6. Provide educational workshops: Offer workshops that teach traditional cultural practices and arts, such as Jewish music, dance, and crafts. These workshops can help preserve cultural heritage and provide opportunities for skill-building and creative expression.
7. Collaborate with community leaders: Work closely with community leaders and respected members to ensure that programs are culturally sensitive and responsive to the needs of the community. This will help build trust and credibility within the community.
8. Be inclusive in marketing: Make sure that promotional materials are accessible and appealing to a diverse audience. Use language and imagery that reflects the cultural identity of the community, and avoid stereotypes or assumptions based on socioeconomic status.
9. Offer opportunities for participation: Encourage community members to get involved in the planning and execution
