Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper middle-income, non-widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Identify and address systemic barriers: Non-upper middle-income individuals may face systemic barriers such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and limited political representation. Addressing these barriers is crucial for creating a more inclusive society.
2. Focus on poverty reduction: Many non-upper middle-income individuals struggle with poverty, which can lead to limited access to healthcare, education, and other essential services. Implementing policies that focus on reducing poverty and improving economic opportunities for these individuals is critical.
