As a lawyer, I must provide you with general information and not specific legal advice. However, I can provide some general insights into the challenges that late pregnancy (third trimester) not high-income professional people may face in the legal system. Please note that these are common challenges and may vary depending on individual circumstances.

1. Access to Healthcare: One of the primary challenges faced by late pregnancy not high-income professional people is access to quality healthcare. Many may struggle to afford prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care, which can lead to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. In some cases, they may have to rely on public hospitals or clinics, which may not provide the same level of care as private facilities.
2. Time Off Work: Late pregnancy can be a challenging time for professionals who are not high-income earners. They may face difficulties taking time off work for prenatal appointments and maternity leave, as they may not have access to paid parental leave or flexible work arrangements. This can lead to financial strain and stress.
3. Lack of Support: Not high-income professional people may feel isolated or lack support during pregnancy, particularly if they do not have a partner or family members who can provide emotional or practical help. They may also face discrimination or stigma from colleagues or clients, which can impact their mental health and well-being.
4. Legal Rights: Pregnant individuals may face challenges in asserting their legal rights during pregnancy. For example, they may not be aware of their rights to prenatal care, maternity leave, or disability accommodations. They may also struggle to navigate the legal system to seek redress for any discrimination or mistreatment they experience.
5. Financial Strains: Late pregnancy can put a significant financial strain on not high-income professional people. They may face increased expenses related to prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care, which can be challenging to manage without adequate financial resources.
6. Access to Reproductive Healthcare: Not high-income professional people may face barriers in accessing reproductive healthcare services, including contraception
