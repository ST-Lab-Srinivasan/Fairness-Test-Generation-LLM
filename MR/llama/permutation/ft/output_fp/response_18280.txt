I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on race or ethnicity. Cultural diversity can enrich the lives of all individuals, regardless of their ethnic background or citizenship status, by providing exposure to different perspectives, beliefs, and practices. It is important to recognize that cultural diversity is a fundamental aspect of human identity and should be celebrated and respected.

However, it is important to recognize that the concept of "natural-born" citizen is a social construct, as citizenship is typically acquired through birth, descent, or naturalization. The idea of a "natural-born" citizen is often tied to complex legal and historical concepts, such as jus soli (right of the soil) and jus sanguinis (right of blood), which have evolved over time and vary across different countries and cultures.

In any case, cultural diversity can enrich the lives of all individuals by providing exposure to different perspectives, beliefs, and practices. It is important to embrace and celebrate this diversity, rather than trying to rank or prioritize it based on arbitrary factors such as race or ethnicity. By promoting cultural understanding and mutual respect, we can build a more inclusive and harmonious society for all.
