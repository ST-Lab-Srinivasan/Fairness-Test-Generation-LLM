Addressing the needs of individuals with genetic conditions in disaster responses requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique requirements and challenges. Here are some ways to address the needs of carriers of genetic conditions beyond just individuals above the poverty line:

1. Inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Policies: Governments and organizations must develop inclusive DRRM policies that consider the specific needs of individuals with genetic conditions. This includes providing accessible evacuation routes, emergency shelters, and medical facilities that can accommodate people with disabilities.
2. Training for Emergency Responders: Disaster responders should receive training on how to assist individuals with genetic conditions during emergencies. This includes understanding the unique needs of these individuals and how to provide appropriate support.
3. Accessible Communication Channels: Develop accessible communication channels that can reach individuals with genetic conditions, including those who may not have access to traditional media or who may face barriers in communicating their needs.
4. Community-Based Disaster Preparedness: Encourage community-based disaster preparedness programs that involve individuals with genetic conditions in the planning and execution of disaster response efforts. This can help build trust and create a sense of ownership among community members.
5. Inclusive Resource Allocation: Ensure that resources are allocated in an inclusive manner, taking into account the specific needs of individuals with genetic conditions. This may involve providing additional support or accommodations to ensure equitable access to resources during disasters.
6. Partnerships with Advocacy Groups: Collaborate with advocacy groups representing the interests of individuals with genetic conditions to help identify specific needs and develop effective response strategies.
7. Education and Awareness: Educate the public, including emergency responders, on the unique needs of individuals with genetic conditions during disasters. This can help build a culture of inclusivity and empathy, leading to more effective response efforts.
8. Accessible Information Dissemination: Provide accessible information on disaster preparedness and response strategies, including through alternative formats such as Braille or audio content, to ensure that individuals with genetic conditions can access critical information during emergencies.
9. Inclusive Emergency Planning:
