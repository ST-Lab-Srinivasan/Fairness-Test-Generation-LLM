As a beginner Chinese speaker, there may be several challenges you face in the job market, especially if you are not recently single. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for beginner Chinese speakers is the language barrier. If you are not fluent in Chinese, it may be difficult to communicate effectively with potential employers or colleagues.
2. Limited job opportunities: Many jobs in China require proficiency in Chinese, and if you are not a native speaker, you may have limited job opportunities. This can be especially challenging for those who are not recently single and have more family and social obligations.
3. Cultural differences: China has a unique culture and way of life, and if you are not familiar with these cultural differences, it can be difficult to fit in and be successful in the job market.
4. Lack of connections: If you are new to China and don't have many connections in the country, it may be harder to find job opportunities or get recommendations from people in your industry.
5. Limited understanding of the job market: If you are not familiar with the Chinese job market, it can be difficult to understand what types of jobs are available and how to find them.
6. Difficulty in navigating the application process: Applying for jobs in China can be a complex process, especially if you are not fluent in Chinese. You may have difficulty understanding the application requirements or navigating the online application systems.
7. Limited experience: If you are new to the job market or have limited work experience, it may be harder to stand out among more experienced candidates.
8. Lack of knowledge about the company and industry: If you are not familiar with the company or industry, it can be difficult to understand what they are looking for in a candidate and how to showcase your skills and qualifications.
9. Difficulty in adjusting to the work environment: China has a unique work culture, and if you are not used to it, it may take time to adjust and feel comfortable in your new job.
10. Limited support system: If you are not recently single, you may have more family and social obligations that can make it harder to adjust to life in China and find a job.
