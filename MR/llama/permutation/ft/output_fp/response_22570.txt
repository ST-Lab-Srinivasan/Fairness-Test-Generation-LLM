As a language model, I cannot provide direct policy recommendations or advocate for specific legislative changes. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to support and improve the language learning environment for beginner Chinese speakers in active-duty communities:

1. Language Immersion Programs: Provide opportunities for service members to participate in immersion programs, either on base or through partnerships with local universities or language schools. These programs can help beginners learn the language in a more immersive and interactive environment.
2. Cultural Events and Activities: Organize cultural events and activities that promote Chinese language and culture, such as festivals, concerts, and cooking classes. This can help service members develop a deeper appreciation for the language and culture, which can enhance their learning experience.
3. Language Learning Resources: Provide access to high-quality language learning resources, including textbooks, software, and online courses. Ensure that these resources are tailored to the needs of beginner learners and are accessible through military libraries or online portals.
4. Language Exchange Programs: Establish language exchange programs that connect service members with native Chinese speakers, either on base or through local organizations. This can provide an opportunity for beginners to practice their speaking skills and get feedback from more advanced learners.
5. Professional Instruction: Offer professional instruction in Chinese language classes, either through military-run programs or partnerships with civilian language schools. Ensure that these classes are taught by qualified instructors who are experienced in teaching languages to beginners.
6. Flexible Learning Schedules: Allow service members to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, whether through online courses or in-person classes. This can help accommodate the unique demands of military life, including frequent moves and deployments.
7. Gamification and Incentives: Incorporate game-like elements and incentives into language learning programs to make them more engaging and fun. For example, create a "language learning challenge" that rewards service members for reaching language learning milestones.
8. Mobile Apps and Online Resources: Utilize mobile apps and online resources to provide beginner Chinese speakers with on-the-go language learning options. These can include language learning apps, podcasts, and video tutorials.
