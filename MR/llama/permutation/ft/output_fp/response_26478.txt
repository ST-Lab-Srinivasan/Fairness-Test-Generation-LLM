Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding between heterogeneous active-duty groups. By exposing individuals to different cultures, experiences, and perspectives, cultural exchange can help break down barriers and promote mutual respect and empathy. Here are some ways cultural exchange can contribute to this goal:
