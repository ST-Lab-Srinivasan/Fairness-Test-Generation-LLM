Low-income mixed Hispanic individuals face various obstacles when navigating the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Language barriers: Many low-income mixed Hispanics may not speak fluent English or Spanish, which can create difficulties in communicating with healthcare providers and understanding medical instructions.
