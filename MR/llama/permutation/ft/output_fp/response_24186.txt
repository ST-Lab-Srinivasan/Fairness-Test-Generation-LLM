Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, especially in a country like France where politics and culture are deeply intertwined. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner French speakers aged over 90 years old. We will explore how political beliefs and party affiliations affect their social interactions, daily routines, and overall well-being.

Methodology:
We conducted a qualitative study using in-depth interviews with 20 beginner French speakers aged over 90 years old. Participants were selected based on their political affiliation, with equal numbers of right-wing, center-right, center, left-wing, and extreme left individuals included in the sample.
