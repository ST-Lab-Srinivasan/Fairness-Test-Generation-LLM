Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are recently widowed, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or translation services to help them navigate official documents and meetings. This can help level the playing field and ensure they are able to participate fully in decision-making processes.
2. Use accessible communication channels: Make sure that information is disseminated through channels that are easily accessible to beginner Arabic speakers, such as social media groups or community centers. This can help them stay informed and engaged in decision-making processes.
3. Build trust and rapport: Take the time to build relationships with these individuals and establish trust. This can involve spending time with them, listening to their concerns, and providing emotional support. Once they feel comfortable, they are more likely to speak up and participate in decision-making processes.
4. Create a safe space for expression: Provide a safe and confidential space where beginner Arabic speakers can express themselves without fear of judgment or reprisal. This can involve using secure communication channels or holding meetings in a private setting.
5. Use visual aids and storytelling: For those who may not be comfortable with spoken language, use visual aids such as pictures or videos to convey information and facilitate decision-making. Storytelling can also be an effective way to communicate complex ideas and values.
6. Involve them in the planning process: Encourage beginner Arabic speakers to participate in the planning stages of decision-making processes. This can involve involving them in brainstorming sessions, focus groups, or other planning activities.
7. Provide cultural competency training: Offer cultural competency training for those involved in decision-making processes to help them better understand the needs and perspectives of beginner Arabic speakers. This can involve learning about their cultural norms, values, and beliefs.
8. Use interpreters or translators: When possible, use interpreters or translators to facilitate communication between beginner Arabic speakers and those involved in decision-making processes. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers are heard.
9. Build partnerships with community organizations
