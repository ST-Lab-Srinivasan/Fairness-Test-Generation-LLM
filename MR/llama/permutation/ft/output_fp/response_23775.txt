Creating more inclusive public policies for mentally able-bodied mixed African Americans requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges and experiences of this community. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Listen to the voices of mixed race individuals: It is essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of mixed race individuals, particularly those who are African American. This includes understanding the complexities of their identities, the challenges they face, and the ways in which they intersect with other marginalized communities.
2. Recognize the intersectionality of identity: Mixed race individuals often experience multiple forms of discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and more. Policies should acknowledge and address these intersections to create a more inclusive environment.
3. Address systemic barriers: Many systemic barriers, such as inadequate funding for mental health services, lack of representation in leadership positions, and discrimination in education and employment, can impact the well-being and opportunities of mixed race individuals. Policies should aim to dismantle these barriers and create more equitable systems.
4. Promote cultural humility: Cultural humility involves recognizing and respecting the diversity of cultural experiences and practices within a community. Policymakers should strive to understand and appreciate the cultural backgrounds of mixed race individuals, and create policies that acknowledge and honor these identities.
5. Foster community engagement: Mixed race individuals often feel isolated or marginalized due to their unique experiences. Policies should encourage community engagement and social connections to help build a sense of belonging and support.
6. Provide mental health resources: Mental health challenges are common among mixed race individuals, who may face added stressors due to discrimination, stigma, and other forms of oppression. Policies should prioritize mental health resources, including culturally sensitive services and support groups.
7. Advocate for representation in media and politics: The lack of representation of mixed race individuals in media and politics can contribute to a sense of invisibility and marginalization. Policymakers should work to promote diversity and inclusion in these areas to ensure that mixed race voices are heard and valued
