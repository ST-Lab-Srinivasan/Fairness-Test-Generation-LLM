There are many successful community initiatives led by Native American recent immigrants to the US and Canada. Here are a few examples:

1. Indigenous-led Environmental Organizations: Many Native American communities have formed their own environmental organizations to address issues such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change. For example, the Native American Environmental Conservation Organization (NAECO) works to protect the environment and promote sustainable development in Native American communities across the US.
2. Urban Indigenous Centers: In many cities across North America, Indigenous peoples have established urban centers that provide a safe space for community members to connect, learn, and access services.

5. Language Revitalization Programs: Many Indigenous communities have established language revitalization programs to promote the use of their traditional languages. These programs often include language classes, cultural events, and resources for language learners.
