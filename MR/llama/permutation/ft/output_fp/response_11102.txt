Creating more inclusive social policies for widowed individuals who are long-time natural-born citizens requires addressing the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Acknowledge the contributions of widows: Widowed individuals, particularly women, often bear the brunt of household responsibilities and caregiving duties after the death of their spouses. Recognizing their contributions to society and valuing their efforts can help alleviate some of the social isolation they may experience.
2. Provide financial support: Many widows face economic insecurity, especially if their spouse was the primary breadwinner. Governments can provide financial assistance, such as pension plans or survivor benefits, to help ease the transition to single life.
3. Offer counseling and mental health services: The loss of a spouse can be incredibly traumatic, leading to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Providing access to counseling and mental health services can help widows cope with their grief and improve their overall well-being.
4. Encourage social interaction: Widows may experience social isolation due to their loss, making it difficult for them to connect with others. Governments can encourage social interaction by providing opportunities for widows to meet and interact with other people in similar situations.
5. Advocate for fair inheritance laws: In many countries, inheritance laws favor male heirs over female heirs, leading to economic inequality among widows. Advocating for fair inheritance laws can help ensure that widows receive a more equitable share of their spouse's assets and can maintain financial independence.
6. Promote education and employment opportunities: Many widows face barriers to education and employment due to societal attitudes and discrimination. Governments can promote educational and employment opportunities for widows by providing scholarships, training programs, and job placement services.
7. Address cultural and social barriers: In many cultures, widows are subject to social stigma and discrimination, leading to further marginalization. Governments can address these cultural and social barriers by promoting awareness campaigns and advocating for policies that promote gender equality and respect for widows' rights.
