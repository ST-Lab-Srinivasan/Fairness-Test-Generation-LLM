Creating more inclusive cultural programs for culturally Hindu lower-class individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges of this community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and respect for diversity to program staff, volunteers, and partners. This can help ensure that the programs are designed with an understanding of the cultural practices and values of lower-class Hindu individuals.
2. Community engagement: Engage with local communities to understand their needs and preferences. This can involve conducting focus groups, surveys, or other forms of community outreach. By listening to the voices and perspectives of the community, program designers can create programs that are more relevant and inclusive.

This can involve providing transportation or childcare services, offering programs in multiple languages, or providing financial assistance for program participation.

This can include incorporating traditional music, dance, art, or other forms of cultural expression into program activities.
