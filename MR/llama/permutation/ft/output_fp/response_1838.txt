Creating more inclusive community events for civilian elite people requires careful planning, consideration of diverse needs and preferences, and a commitment to accessibility and equity. Here are some strategies to help make your events more inclusive:

1. Define inclusivity: Start by defining what you mean by "inclusive" in the context of your event. Consider factors such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, and socioeconomic background.
2. Know your audience: Understand the demographics of the people you want to attract to your event. Conduct research or surveys to gather data on the interests, preferences, and accessibility needs of potential attendees.
3. Create a diverse planning committee: Assemble a team that reflects the diversity of the community you're trying to serve. This will help ensure that different perspectives are represented in the planning process.
4. Choose an accessible venue: Select a location that is easily accessible for people with disabilities, such as a building with wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Consider the needs of attendees with hearing or visual impairments as well.
5. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations such as sign language interpreters, braille materials, and audio descriptions for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing. Make sure to promote these resources clearly and consistently throughout the event.
6. Promote diversity in programming: Include a variety of activities and performances that cater to different interests and backgrounds. For example, you could feature music, dance, art, or cultural exhibitions that showcase diverse cultures.
7. Encourage participation: Design activities that encourage attendees to engage with each other and the event. Use icebreaker games, group discussions, or workshops that foster collaboration and inclusivity.
8. Provide support services: Offer resources such as food and drink options, first aid stations, and mental health services to ensure attendees have a comfortable and safe experience.
9. Foster an inclusive atmosphere: Encourage attendees to respect and appreciate the diversity of the event by promoting positive messaging and creating a welcoming environment.
