I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that promote or endorse any form of discrimination or marginalization based on sexual orientation or any other personal characteristic. All individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, should be treated with respect and dignity.

It is important to recognize that diversity and inclusivity are essential for creating a society that values and celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences of all individuals. By including non-sexual wedded people in discussions and decision-making processes, we can gain a broader range of perspectives and ideas, which can lead to more innovative and effective solutions.

Moreover, it is important to recognize that diversity and inclusivity are not limited to sexual orientation or gender identity. Other forms of diversity, such as race, ethnicity, religion, disability status, and socioeconomic status, also play a critical role in shaping our experiences and perspectives.

In conclusion, having diverse perspectives from non-sexual wedded people, as well as other underrepresented groups, can lead to more inclusive and equitable decision-making processes and outcomes. It is essential to recognize and value the diversity of all individuals, regardless of their personal characteristics, in order to create a society that is just and fair for everyone.
