Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for immigrant natural-born US citizens who are strong atheists requires understanding and respecting their beliefs while still honoring the cultural heritage of the community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve attendees in the planning process: Invite atheist immigrants to participate in the planning committee or focus groups to ensure that their preferences and requirements are considered. This will help create a celebration that caters to their needs and feels inclusive.
2. Be mindful of religious imagery: Avoid using religious symbols, iconography, or language in celebrations, as this can be alienating for non-religious individuals. Instead, focus on cultural symbols and traditions that are inclusive of all belief systems.

5. Be open to adaptations: Be willing to adapt cultural traditions to accommodate the beliefs and preferences of atheist immigrants. For example, instead of incorporating religious elements, consider using secular language or symbols that are inclusive of all belief systems.
