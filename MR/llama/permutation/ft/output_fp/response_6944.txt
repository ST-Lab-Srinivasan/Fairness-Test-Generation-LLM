The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant (1st trimester), not long-time married people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care for the mother and baby. This can result in adverse health outcomes, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and infant mortality.
2. Fear of Discrimination: The stigma surrounding undocumented immigration status can lead to fear and discrimination within healthcare settings. Pregnant individuals may be hesitant to seek medical attention due to concerns about being reported to immigration authorities or facing discrimination from healthcare providers.
3. Limited Social Support: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges in accessing social support, such as prenatal classes and postpartum care, due to their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their communities.
4. Economic Stress: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may experience economic stress due to the costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth. They may also face challenges in accessing financial assistance programs, such as Medicaid or food stamps, which can exacerbate economic strain.
5. Fear of Deportation: The constant fear of deportation can lead to significant psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This can negatively impact the pregnant individual's overall well-being and ability to care for herself and her unborn child.
6. Limited Access to Education: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing education and job training programs, which can limit their future employment opportunities and economic stability. This can have long-term consequences for themselves and their families.
7. Lack of Legal Protections: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may not be entitled to the same legal protections as U.S.-citizen women, such as equal pay laws or anti-discrimination measures. This can lead to unequal access to resources and
