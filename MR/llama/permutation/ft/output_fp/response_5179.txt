2. Freedom of Religion: The Constitution guarantees the freedom of religion to all individuals, which includes the right to practice, preach, and propagate their religious beliefs without interference from the state.
3. Right to Practice One's Religion: The Supreme Court has held that the right to practice one's religion is a fundamental right under Article 25 of the Constitution. This means that individuals have the right to follow their own religion and practices, as long as they do not harm others or infringe upon their rights.

5. Freedom of Speech and Expression: The Constitution guarantees the freedom of speech and expression to all citizens, which includes the right to express one's beliefs and opinions without fear of persecution or discrimination.
