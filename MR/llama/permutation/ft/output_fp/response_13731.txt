Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who are lifelong learners of Arabic. Arabic is a language that has a rich cultural heritage, with a long history of literature, poetry, and art. As a result, learning Arabic can provide individuals with a deeper understanding of the culture and society in which it is spoken.

Identity formation:
Cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity in several ways. Firstly, it can provide a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For example, a lifelong beginner Arabic speaker may feel a strong connection to the Arab world and its culture, which can shape their identity as an Arabic learner. Secondly, cultural heritage can influence an individual's values, beliefs, and practices. For instance, learning about Islamic traditions and customs in Arabic can shape an individual's understanding of what it means to be a Muslim.

Language acquisition:
Learning Arabic can also play a role in shaping an individual's identity. As a lifelong beginner, the individual may experience a sense of accomplishment and pride as they progress in their language learning journey. This can contribute to their overall identity as a linguistically competent person. Additionally, the process of language acquisition can influence an individual's worldview and perspective on life, as they learn about different cultures and ways of thinking through Arabic language media.

Intersectionality:
It is important to recognize that cultural heritage and identity are complex and multifaceted, and can intersect with other aspects of an individual's identity such as race, gender, sexuality, and religion. For example, a lifelong beginner Arabic speaker who is also a woman may experience a different identity formation process than a male counterpart. Similarly, an individual who identifies as LGBTQ+ may face unique challenges in navigating the cultural norms and values of the Arab world.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong beginner Arabic speakers. Learning Arabic can provide individuals with a deeper understanding of the culture and society in which it is spoken, and can influence their identity formation through language acquisition and cultural exposure.
