Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of leftist lesbian people, as it can affect their access to basic rights and freedoms, as well as their ability to live openly and authentically. Here are some of the ways in which immigration status can impact the lives of leftist lesbian people:

1. Legal rights and protections: Depending on their immigration status, leftist lesbian people may not have access to the same legal rights and protections as others. For example, they may not be eligible for protection against discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
2. Employment and economic security: Leftist lesbian people who are undocumented or have temporary status may face barriers to finding stable employment or accessing financial resources. This can lead to economic insecurity and difficulty paying for basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare.
3. Healthcare access: Undocumented leftist lesbian people may face barriers to accessing healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare. This can be particularly challenging for people who are living with HIV or have other health conditions that require ongoing medical care.

This can result in low self-esteem, self-blame, and a lack of agency and autonomy.
