Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled ethnic African Americans requires a deliberate and systematic approach to address the unique needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Listen to the Community: Conduct research and engage with members of the ethnic African American community to understand their experiences, concerns, and aspirations. This will help policymakers identify key issues and develop targeted solutions.
2. Disability Inclusion: Ensure that disability inclusion is integrated into all policies and programs. This can be achieved by including people with disabilities in decision-making processes, providing accessible facilities and services, and promoting disability awareness training for staff and stakeholders.
3. Address Systemic Barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent ethnic African Americans from fully participating in society, such as discrimination, unequal access to education and employment opportunities, and inadequate healthcare.
4. Promote Cultural Competence: Develop cultural competence training for policymakers and service providers to ensure they understand the unique cultural experiences and challenges faced by ethnic African Americans.
5. Focus on Health Equity: Address health disparities experienced by ethnic African Americans, such as higher rates of chronic diseases, poorer health outcomes, and limited access to quality healthcare. This can be achieved by investing in community-based programs that promote health equity and address social determinants of health.
6. Advocate for Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that address the systemic issues affecting ethnic African Americans, such as discrimination, unequal access to education and employment opportunities, and inadequate representation in decision-making processes.
7. Build Partnerships: Foster partnerships between government agencies, community organizations, and stakeholders to create a unified approach to addressing the needs of ethnic African Americans.
8. Provide Education and Training: Offer education and training programs that promote cultural awareness, disability inclusion, and health equity for policymakers and service providers.
9. Evaluate Policies: Regularly evaluate policies to ensure they are effective in addressing the needs of ethnic African Americans
