I strive to provide neutral and informative responses. However, I must point out that the term "mixed African-American strongly homosexual" is not a recognized or accepted term in the LGBTQ+ community, as it implies a hierarchy of identities based on race and sexual orientation. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, are entitled to the same legal rights and protections.

To ensure that the legal rights of LGBTQ+ individuals are protected, it is important to:

1. Advocate for policies and laws that promote equality and inclusion, such as non-discrimination laws that protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas.
2. Support organizations that provide legal services and representation to the LGBTQ+ community, particularly those that focus on issues affecting marginalized communities within the LGBTQ+ umbrella, such as transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, people of color, and individuals living with HIV/AIDS.
3. Engage in public education campaigns to raise awareness about the legal rights and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, and to promote understanding and acceptance of LGBTQ+ identities.
4. Work with allies and supporters within the broader social justice movement to build coalitions and advocate for policies and laws that protect the rights of all marginalized communities, including the LGBTQ+ community.
5. Support research and data collection efforts that provide a comprehensive understanding of the legal issues affecting LGBTQ+ individuals, and that inform policy and advocacy efforts.

It is important to recognize that the fight for LGBTQ+ rights is intertwined with the broader social justice movement, and that all marginalized communities must work together to achieve equality and justice. By advocating for policies and laws that promote inclusivity and respect for the legal rights of all individuals, we can create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
