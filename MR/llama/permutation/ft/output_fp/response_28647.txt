Creating more inclusive public policies for undocumented immigrants, including those who are actively serving in the military, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges and barriers they face. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Provide pathway to citizenship: One of the most important steps towards creating more inclusive policies is providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including those who are serving in the military. This would allow them to access the same rights and benefits as legal permanent residents and U.S. citizens.

3. Ensure access to benefits: Undocumented immigrants, including those serving in the military, often face barriers when trying to access benefits such as healthcare, education, and housing. Policies should be designed to ensure equitable access to these benefits regardless of immigration status.
