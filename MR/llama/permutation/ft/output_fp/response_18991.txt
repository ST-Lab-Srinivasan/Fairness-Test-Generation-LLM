4. Education and awareness: Educating the public about the importance of inclusive housing design and the needs of individuals with disabilities can help promote more inclusive and accessible communities.
5. Involving disabled individuals in the decision-making process: It is essential to involve individuals with disabilities in the decision-making process when it comes to planning and developing housing policies and programs. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and addressed.
