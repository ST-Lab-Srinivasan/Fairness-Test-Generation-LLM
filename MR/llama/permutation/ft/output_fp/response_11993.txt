Promoting the educational success of Native American student individuals in the United States can be a complex and multifaceted process. Here are some strategies that have been shown to be effective:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American students often face significant cultural and linguistic barriers in the classroom. Teachers can use culturally responsive teaching practices, such as incorporating traditional knowledge and perspectives into lessons, to help bridge these gaps and make learning more relevant and engaging.

This can include incorporating traditional ecological knowledge, traditional medicine, and other indigenous ways of knowing into science and math classes.
