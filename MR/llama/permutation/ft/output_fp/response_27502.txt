The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-child wedded people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Legal Barriers: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident may face legal barriers that make it difficult for them to obtain a green card or citizenship. For example, the "bars to admission" in the Immigration and Nationality Act can create significant hurdles for certain classes of immigrants, including those who entered the U.S. without inspection, those who have been deported, or those who have committed certain crimes.
2. Separation from Family: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident may face separation from their spouse and other family members due to immigration status. This can lead to emotional distress, financial strain, and difficulty accessing support systems.
3. Limited Access to Benefits: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident may have limited access to benefits such as healthcare, housing assistance, and food assistance. This can exacerbate existing economic challenges and limit their ability to provide for themselves and their families.
4. Job Discrimination: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident may face job discrimination based on their immigration status. Employers may be hesitant to hire individuals who are not authorized to work in the U.S., which can limit career advancement and earning potential.
5. Detention and Deportation: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident may face detention and deportation if they are discovered to be in the U.S. without proper documentation. This can lead to separation from their spouse and other family members, as well as significant emotional distress.
6. Lack of Civic Participation: Non-citizens who are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident may face barriers to civic participation, such as voting or running for political office. This can limit their ability to fully contribute to society and participate in the democratic process.
