Creating more inclusive cultural events for individuals who are undocumented or in a mixed-status family can be achieved by taking the following steps:

1. Understand and acknowledge the unique challenges faced by this community: Undocumented individuals often face significant barriers to accessing basic needs such as healthcare, education, and legal services. Acknowledging these challenges and recognizing their impact on the community can help create a more inclusive environment.

This can involve asking for feedback on potential venues, performers, and activities to ensure that they are accessible and inclusive.
3. Provide language support: Many undocumented individuals may not speak the dominant language in their area. Providing translation services or interpretation support can help ensure that everyone feels included and can participate fully in cultural events.
4. Foster a welcoming environment: Create a safe and welcoming space for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve training event staff on cultural sensitivity and how to provide supportive and inclusive services.

This can involve partnering with local organizations that provide these services or providing referrals to trusted organizations.

This can involve hosting workshops, performances, or panel discussions where participants can share their perspectives and connect with others who may be facing similar challenges.
8. Foster cross-cultural understanding:
