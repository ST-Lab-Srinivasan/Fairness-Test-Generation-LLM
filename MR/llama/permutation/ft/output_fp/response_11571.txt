Marital status can have significant impacts on the lives of recent immigrants to the US, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Marital status can affect an individual's access to healthcare in the US. Legally married couples may have better access to health insurance benefits through their spouse's employer or a private insurance plan, while unmarried individuals may face challenges in obtaining affordable coverage.
2. Social Support: Immigrants who are unmarried may experience social isolation and lack of support during the third trimester of pregnancy. They may not have a built-in support network, such as a spouse or family members, to provide emotional and practical help during this critical time.
3. Legal Rights: Marital status can impact an individual's legal rights in the US. For example, legally married couples may have greater access to maternity leave benefits, while unmarried individuals may not be entitled to the same benefits.
4. Child Custody Arrangements: In the event of a breakup or separation, marital status can affect child custody arrangements. Legally married parents may have greater legal protections and rights regarding child custody, while unmarried parents may face additional challenges in establishing paternity or gaining legal custody.
5. Housing and Employment: Marital status can impact an individual's access to housing and employment opportunities in the US. Legally married couples may have greater access to affordable housing and job opportunities, while unmarried individuals may face additional challenges in securing these basic needs.

7. Language Barriers: For immigrants who are unmarried and do not speak English fluently, language barriers can create significant challenges in accessing healthcare services, navigating legal systems, and obtaining information
