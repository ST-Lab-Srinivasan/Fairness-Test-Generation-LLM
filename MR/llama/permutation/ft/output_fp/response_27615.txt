Creating more inclusive housing policies for recently expectant not in a relationship (REN) individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that acknowledges the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Recognize the need for support: REN individuals often lack access to adequate support systems, such as childcare, parenting classes, and financial assistance. Housing policies can prioritize providing these resources alongside housing options.
2. Flexible housing options: Offer flexible housing arrangements, such as shared or co-living spaces, that cater to the needs of REN individuals. This could include single rooms or apartments with shared common areas, allowing for a sense of community while maintaining privacy and independence.
3. Inclusive language: Use language in housing policies and marketing materials that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities and expressions. Avoid assumptions about pregnancy or parenthood based on gender identity.
4. Accessibility features: Ensure that any new housing developments or renovations include accessibility features, such as wheelchair-accessible units, gender-neutral bathrooms, and adapted kitchens for individuals with mobility impairments.
5. Childcare support: Offer on-site childcare services or provide resources for finding affordable, high-quality childcare options near housing developments. This can help reduce the financial burden on REN individuals and allow them to focus on their well-being and career goals.
6. Financial assistance: Provide financial assistance programs, such as subsidies or grants, to help REN individuals cover expenses related to childcare, education, and job training. This can help level the playing field and support their long-term economic stability.
7. Community engagement: Create opportunities for REN individuals to connect with peers and build a supportive community. This could include hosting events, workshops, or mentorship programs that foster collaboration and mutual support.
8. Healthcare access: Ensure that any housing policies provide easy access to quality healthcare services, including prenatal care, postpartum care, and mental health resources.
9. Legal protections: Advocate for legal protections against discrimination based on pregnancy or parent
