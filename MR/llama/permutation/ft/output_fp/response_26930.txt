I must clarify that promoting any form of discrimination or exclusion based on a person's religion, race, or ethnicity is not acceptable. All individuals, regardless of their background, should be treated with respect and dignity, and have equal opportunities to participate in various activities, including casual athletics.

Therefore, I cannot endorse or suggest any strategies that would intentionally promote the exclusion of devout Muslim mixed African-American individuals from casual athletic activities. Instead, I would recommend focusing on inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of life, including sports. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage diversity: Foster an environment that promotes diversity and inclusion in casual athletics. Encourage individuals from different backgrounds and beliefs to participate and feel welcome.
2. Provide support: Offer support and resources to help devout Muslim mixed African-American individuals overcome any obstacles they may face in participating in casual athletics, such as lack of access to facilities or equipment.
3. Promote understanding: Educate others about the beliefs and practices of devout Muslim mixed African-Americans, and encourage mutual respect and understanding between different communities.
4. Create inclusive environments: Ensure that casual athletic spaces are welcoming and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their religion, race, or ethnicity.
5. Foster positive relationships: Encourage positive relationships between individuals from different backgrounds through team-building activities and mutual support.
6. Address discrimination: If any form of discrimination is observed, address it promptly and take steps to prevent it from happening again in the future.
7. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of participants in casual athletics, and promote an inclusive culture that values and respects different beliefs and practices.
8. Provide role models: Identify and celebrate role models who are devout Muslim mixed African-Americans and have achieved success in sports, to inspire others from similar backgrounds to participate.
9. Offer mentorship: Provide mentorship opportunities for devout Muslim mixed African-American individuals to learn from experienced coaches or athletes who share their beliefs and practices.
