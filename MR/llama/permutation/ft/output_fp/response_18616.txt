Promoting the cultural preservation of natural-born citizen Native American communities in the United States requires a multi-faceted approach that involves various stakeholders, including government agencies, non-profit organizations, community leaders, and individual citizens. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to support the cultural preservation of these communities:

1. Support Tribal Self-Governance: The federal government should continue to work closely with tribal governments to provide them with the resources and support they need to preserve their cultures, languages, and traditions. This includes providing funding for cultural preservation programs, as well as technical assistance and training to help tribes develop their own cultural preservation initiatives.
2. Protect Cultural Heritage Sites: The federal government should work to protect cultural heritage sites located on tribal lands, including historic buildings, artifacts, and other cultural resources. This can involve designating these sites as National Historic Landmarks or placing them on the National Register of Historic Places.
3. Promote Native Languages: The federal government should support efforts to preserve and promote Native American languages by providing funding for language revitalization programs and supporting language immersion schools. This can also involve developing educational materials and resources that are culturally appropriate and tailored to the needs of Native American students.
4. Support Traditional Arts and Crafts: The federal government should work to promote the traditional arts and crafts of Native American communities by providing funding for artisan training and apprenticeship programs, as well as supporting the development of markets for Native American handmade products.
5. Develop Cultural Tourism Initiatives: The federal government can support cultural tourism initiatives that promote the rich cultural heritage of Native American communities. This can involve developing interpretive centers and museums, as well as organizing cultural festivals and events that showcase Native American traditions and artistry.
6. Provide Education and Awareness: The federal government should work to educate the public about the importance of preserving Native American cultures and the contributions that these communities have made to the United States. This can involve developing educational materials and resources that are culturally appropriate and tailored to the needs of K-12 students, as well as organizing cultural awareness events and initiatives.
