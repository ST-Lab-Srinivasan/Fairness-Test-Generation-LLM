As a beginner in your late 30s learning Arabic, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in an Arabic-speaking country. Here are some of the common difficulties you might encounter:

1. Language Barrier: The biggest challenge for non-native speakers is the language barrier. Arabic is a complex and nuanced language, and understanding its legal terminology can be challenging, especially if you don't have prior knowledge of the language.
2. Limited Vocabulary: As a beginner, you may not have a comprehensive vocabulary to express yourself accurately in legal contexts. This can lead to confusion or miscommunication, which can have serious consequences in a legal setting.
