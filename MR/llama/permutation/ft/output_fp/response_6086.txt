Nigeria has a large and diverse population, with many different ethnic groups and languages. The country has a long history of colonialism and military rule, which has led to a complex system of governance and power dynamics. Advocating for the rights of Nigerian reservists can be challenging, but there are several examples of successful advocacy efforts throughout the country's history. Here are some examples:

1. The Niger Delta Environmental Rights Initiative (NDERI): This is a non-profit organization that works to protect the rights of indigenous peoples in the Niger Delta region, including their right to participate in decision-making processes related to natural resource management and development. NDERI has successfully advocated for the recognition and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in several high-profile cases, including a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that recognized the rights of the Ogoni people to control their own land and resources.
2. The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ): This organization is dedicated to promoting social justice and human rights in Nigeria. The CSJ has advocated for the rights of marginalized groups, including reservists, through a variety of means, such as public awareness campaigns, legal action, and community development projects. In 2015, the CSJ successfully lobbied the Nigerian government to establish a Reserves Management Committee to oversee the management of the country's reserves.
3. The Nigeria Human Rights Forum (NHRF): This is a non-governmental organization that works to promote and protect human rights in Nigeria. The NHRF has advocated for the rights of reservists, including their right to participate in decision-making processes related to natural resource management and development. In 2013, the NHRF successfully lobbied the Nigerian government to establish a National Commission on Reserves Management to oversee the management of the country's reserves.
4. The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC): This organization is dedicated to promoting transparency and accountability in governance in Nigeria. CISLAC has advocated for the rights of reservists, including their right to participate in decision-making processes related to natural resource management and development.
