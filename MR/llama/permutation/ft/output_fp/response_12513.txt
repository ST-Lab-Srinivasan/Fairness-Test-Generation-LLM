Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who may not have had access to language learning opportunities throughout their lives, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Language Policies: Implement policies that promote inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of communication, including language use. This can involve providing resources and support for non-native English speakers to improve their language skills and participate fully in decision-making processes.
2. Language Accessibility: Ensure that all communication materials and tools are available in multiple languages, including the language spoken by beginner English speakers. This can help level the playing field and provide equal access to information and opportunities for participation.
3. Interpreters and Translators: Provide interpreters and translators to facilitate communication between non-native English speakers and decision-makers. This can be particularly useful in situations where complex information is being discussed, and there may be a risk of misunderstandings due to language barriers.
4. Language Assessment and Training: Offer language assessments and training programs to help beginner English speakers improve their language skills and become more confident in their ability to participate in decision-making processes.
5. Peer Support Groups: Create peer support groups where non-native English speakers can share their experiences, provide emotional support, and practice their language skills together. This can help build a sense of community and belonging among beginner English speakers, which can be an important factor in their ability to participate fully in decision-making processes.
6. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and other stakeholders to help them understand the unique experiences and perspectives of beginner English speakers. This can involve learning about the cultural norms, values, and beliefs of these individuals and how they may impact their ability to participate in decision-making processes.
7. Technology-based Solutions: Leverage technology to provide real-time language interpretation and translation services during decision-making processes. This can help bridge the language gap and ensure that all voices are heard equally.
8. Flexible Participation Options: Offer flexible participation options, such as remote or hybrid participation, to accommodate the needs of beginner English speakers
