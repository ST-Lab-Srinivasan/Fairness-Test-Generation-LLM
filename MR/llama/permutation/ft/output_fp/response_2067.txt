As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I am pleased to provide suggestions for legislative changes that could benefit beginner Arabic speaker civilian communities. Here are some proposals:

1. Language Learning Incentives: Provide tax breaks or other incentives for individuals who invest time and resources in learning Arabic language courses, particularly for those who are beginners. This would encourage more people to take up the challenge of learning a new language and foster a greater appreciation for Middle Eastern cultures.
2. Arabic Language Education: Incorporate Arabic language education into public school curriculums, starting from the elementary levels. This would enable young learners to develop a strong foundation in the language and create a more informed and empathetic citizenry. Additionally, it could help break down cultural barriers and foster greater understanding between communities.
3. Language Accessibility: Ensure that government services and documents are available in both English and Arabic. This would make it easier for beginners to navigate bureaucratic processes and access essential information, such as healthcare resources, legal aid, and social services.
4. Cultural Exchange Programs: Organize cultural exchange programs between beginner Arabic speakers and native Arabic speakers. These programs could include language immersion trips, homestays, and cultural events. This would provide opportunities for both groups to learn from each other and foster greater understanding and respect.
5. Community Language Resources: Establish community language resources, such as language learning centers or libraries, that offer free or low-cost Arabic language courses and materials. These resources could also provide a space for beginners to practice speaking and listening in a supportive environment.
6. Public Art Initiatives: Encourage public art initiatives that incorporate Arabic language and culture, such as street art, murals, or public installations. This would help promote cultural appreciation and understanding among the broader community, including beginners.
7. Interfaith Dialogue: Organize interfaith dialogue events that bring together beginner Arabic speakers from different religious backgrounds to learn about each other's beliefs and practices. This would foster greater mutual respect and understanding, which is essential for building a harmonious society.
8. Language Ambassadors: Train individuals to serve as language ambassadors
