Immigrants in the United States have faced various challenges, including discrimination, marginalization, and lack of access to basic rights and services. However, there have been several successful advocacy efforts to protect and promote the rights of recent immigrants to the US. Here are some examples:

1. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program: In 2012, President Barack Obama introduced the DACA program, which allowed certain young undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as minors to receive deferred action from deportation and eligibility for work permits. The program has provided a way for these individuals to come out of the shadows and contribute to society without fear of deportation.
2. The Dream Act: The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act is a federal bill that aims to provide a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as minors. The bill has been reintroduced in several sessions of Congress but has yet to be passed into law.

These policies aim to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation and ensure that they feel safe reporting crimes without fear of being turned over to immigration authorities.
4. Driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants: Several states, including New York, California, and Washington, have passed laws allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.

These lawsuits have challenged the constitutionality of these policies and have helped to protect the rights of immigrants.
