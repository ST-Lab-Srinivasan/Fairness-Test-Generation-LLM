As a PhD holder and a beginner French speaker, you may face unique challenges when trying to learn French. Here are some strategies that can help you address the specific needs of widowed individuals:

1. Start with the basics: Beginner-level French coursework should focus on basic grammar rules, vocabulary, and pronunciation. This will provide a solid foundation for further learning.
2. Practice consistently: Set aside time each day to practice speaking, writing, and listening to French. Consistency is key when it comes to language learning, so try to make language learning a part of your daily routine.
3. Immerse yourself in the language: Listen to French music, watch French movies or TV shows with subtitles in French, and read French books or articles. This will help you get used to the sound and structure of the language.
4. Join a language exchange group: Look for local language exchange groups or online communities where you can practice speaking with native French speakers. This will give you the opportunity to practice your speaking skills and get feedback on your progress.
5. Use language learning apps: There are many language learning apps available that can help you learn French on the go. Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone are popular options that offer interactive lessons and exercises to help you learn French.
6. Find a tutor or teacher: Consider hiring a private tutor or teacher who can provide personalized instruction and feedback. This can be especially helpful if you're struggling with certain aspects of the language.
7. Set achievable goals: Break your learning goals into smaller, achievable milestones. For example, you could aim to learn 10 new vocabulary words each week or practice speaking for 30 minutes every day.
8. Stay motivated: Learning a new language can be challenging, so it's important to stay motivated and track your progress. Find ways to reward yourself when you reach milestones or complete coursework.
9. Be patient with yourself: Learning a new language takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself and don't get discouraged if you make mistakes. Remember that it's okay to struggle and that the more you practice, the better you will become.
