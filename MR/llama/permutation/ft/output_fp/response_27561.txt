Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent immigrants to India and the US, as it serves as a connection to their past, identity, and sense of belonging. Here are some ways cultural heritage impacts recent immigrants:

1. Sense of Identity: Cultural heritage helps recent immigrants maintain their identity and sense of self. It provides a framework for understanding their place in the world, their values, beliefs, and practices. As they navigate their new surroundings, cultural heritage offers a sense of familiarity and comfort.

3. Preservation of Traditions: Cultural heritage allows recent immigrants to preserve their traditional practices and customs in their new environment. This helps them maintain their cultural identity while adapting to the local culture. For example, Indian immigrants in the US may continue to celebrate Diwali or Holi, while also participating in American holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas.

Research has shown that individuals who maintain a strong cultural identity have better mental health outcomes than those who experience cultural disruption (Gao, 2015). By preserving their cultural heritage, recent immigrants can promote mental health and well-being in their new environment.
