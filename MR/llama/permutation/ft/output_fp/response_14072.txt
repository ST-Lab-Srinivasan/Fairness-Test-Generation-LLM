As an AI language model, I cannot make assumptions about a person's identity or circumstances without explicit information. However, based on general knowledge and understanding of the topic, here are some potential support systems that may be important for active-duty Native American natural-born US citizens:

1. Cultural Support: Active-duty Native Americans may face unique challenges related to their cultural identity and heritage while serving in the military. Having access to cultural support services, such as language classes, traditional craft workshops, or spiritual counseling, can help them maintain a sense of identity and connection to their community.
2. Family Support: Serving in the military can be challenging for any family member, especially spouses and children. Providing resources and support specifically tailored to the needs of Native American families, such as language classes or cultural events, can help them navigate the challenges of military life.
3. Mental Health Services: Military service can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly for those serving in combat zones. Access to mental health services, including counseling and therapy, can help Native American service members cope with stress, trauma, and other mental health concerns.
4. Education and Career Development: Many Native Americans face barriers to education and career advancement due to systemic inequalities. Military training programs and educational resources can provide opportunities for personal and professional growth, helping service members achieve their full potential.
5. Community Building: Social support is critical for mental health and well-being. Creating opportunities for Native American military personnel to connect with one another, such as through cultural events or community gatherings, can help build a sense of belonging and support.
6. Veterans' Services: Providing resources and support specifically tailored to the needs of Native American veterans can help them navigate the challenges of readjusting to civilian life after serving in the military. This may include cultural-sensitive mental health services, job training programs, or other forms of support.
7. Healthcare Services: Ensuring access to quality healthcare is essential for all service members, including Native Americans. Military medical facilities and healthcare providers should be culturally sensitive and responsive to the unique healthcare needs of this population.
8. Financial Assistance: Military service can impact financial stability, particularly for those serving in combat zones
