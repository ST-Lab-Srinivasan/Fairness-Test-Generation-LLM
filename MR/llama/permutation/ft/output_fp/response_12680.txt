Introduction:
Marriage and family dynamics can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with genetic conditions in Nigeria. The stigma and discrimination associated with these conditions can be particularly challenging for individuals who are part of a traditional or cultural society where family and community expectations are high. This study aimed to explore the experiences of Nigerian individuals living with genetic conditions and the impacts of their marital status on their lives.

Methodology:
A qualitative research design was used, consisting of in-depth interviews with 20 Nigerian individuals living with genetic conditions.

4. Financial burden: Many participants reported financial difficulties due to their condition, which were exacerbated by their marital status. They often relied on their spouses for financial support, which can create tension in the relationship.
5. Lack of support: Participants reported a lack of support from
