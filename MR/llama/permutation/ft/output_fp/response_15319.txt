Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life, including their social, economic, and emotional well-being. In India, the status of being married or unmarried can have different implications for early pregnancy individuals, particularly during the first trimester. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of early pregnancy natural-born Indian citizen individuals.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with 20 early pregnancy individuals aged between 18 and 35 years old. Participants will be recruited through purposive sampling, and will be selected based on their marital status (married or unmarried) and residency in India. The interviews will be conducted in the participants' homes or at a designated location, and will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
The thematic analysis of the interview data revealed several impacts of marital status on early pregnancy individuals in India. These include:

1. Social stigma and discrimination: Many married participants reported experiencing social stigma and discrimination from their families, communities, and healthcare providers due to their marital status. Unmarried participants also faced similar challenges, but to a lesser extent.
2. Economic implications: Married participants were more likely to experience economic difficulties during early pregnancy, particularly if they were not working or had limited income sources. Unmarried participants, on the other hand, had more control over their financial decisions and were more likely to have a stable source of income.
3. Emotional challenges: Early pregnancy can be emotionally challenging for both married and unmarried individuals. However, married participants reported feeling more isolated and alone during this period, particularly if their spouse was not supportive or present. Unmarried participants, on the other hand, had more social support from friends and family.
4. Healthcare access: Married participants faced more challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly in rural areas where there may be limited healthcare facilities. Unmarried participants had more control over their healthcare decisions and were more likely to seek medical attention when needed.
