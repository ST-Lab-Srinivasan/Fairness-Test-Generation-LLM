Older adults, particularly those over 90 years old (or over 85), face a range of challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Access to care: Older adults may experience difficulties accessing healthcare services due to mobility issues, transportation barriers, or lack of availability of healthcare providers in their area.
2. Language barriers: For native French speakers living in non-French-speaking countries, language barriers can hinder communication with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
3. Cultural differences: Older adults may encounter cultural differences in healthcare systems, such as different attitudes towards aging, death, and end-of-life care. These differences can lead to confusion or dissatisfaction with the healthcare provided.
4. Chronic conditions: Older adults are more likely to have chronic conditions, such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, or heart failure, which require ongoing medical attention and management.
5. Polypharmacy: Many older adults take multiple medications, which can increase the risk of adverse drug events, drug interactions, and hospitalizations.
6. Falls and injuries: Older adults are at higher risk of falls and injuries due to declining physical function and mobility, leading to increased rates of hip fractures and other injuries.
7. Social isolation: Many older adults experience social isolation, which can negatively impact mental health and well-being, particularly if they live alone or have limited social support networks.
8. Lack of geriatric care: Many healthcare systems lack specialized geriatric care, resulting in a lack of age-appropriate care and services for older adults.
9. Limited home care: Older adults may require assistance with daily activities but have limited access to home care services, leading to increased reliance on hospitals or nursing homes.
10. Ageism: Unfortunately, many healthcare providers may hold ageist attitudes, which can result in older adults being dismissed or marginalized in the healthcare system.
11. Limited access to geriatric mental health services: Older adults may experience mental health issues
