The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant (third trimester) not-lifelong single people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking prenatal care, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care. This can result in poor pregnancy outcomes, such as premature birth or low birth weight.
2. Fear of Discrimination: Recently pregnant individuals who are undocumented immigrants may experience fear and anxiety about discrimination based on their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of isolation and stigma, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being during a critical time in their pregnancy.
3. Limited Social Support: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to social support networks, such as family and friends, due to their immigration status. This can make it more challenging for them to cope with the physical and emotional demands of pregnancy and parenthood.
4. Economic Instability: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented immigrants may face economic instability due to their immigration status. They may struggle to find or keep employment, which can lead to financial insecurity and stress during a critical time in their pregnancy.
5. Fear of Deportation: The fear of deportation can be a significant concern for recently pregnant undocumented immigrants. This fear can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being during pregnancy.
6. Limited Access to Resources: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to resources such as prenatal care, nutrition programs, and parenting classes. This can result in a lack of information and support during pregnancy and early parenthood.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Recently pregnant undocumented immigrants may face stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, and isolation, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being during pregnancy.
