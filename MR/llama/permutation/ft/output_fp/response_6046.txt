As a soft libertarian, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices and decisions, as long as they do not harm others. When it comes to disaster response, it is important to recognize that recently divorced individuals, especially those who have gone through multiple divorces, may have unique needs and challenges. Here are some ways to address these needs in a respectful and inclusive manner:

1. Recognize their autonomy: Respect the individual's right to make their own decisions and choices, even if you do not agree with them. Avoid imposing your own beliefs or values on them, especially when it comes to matters of personal freedom.
2. Provide safe spaces: Offer safe and comfortable spaces where recently divorced individuals can retreat and recharge. This could include designated areas for rest, relaxation, or privacy.
3. Offer tailored support: Recognize that each individual has their own unique needs and challenges. Offer support tailored to their specific situation, such as counseling, mentorship, or connectivity with other individuals who have gone through similar experiences.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for recently divorced individuals to connect with others in a safe and supportive environment. This could include group activities, volunteer work, or social events.
5. Avoid stigmatization: Be mindful of the language and terminology used when addressing recently divorced individuals. Avoid using stigmatizing terms or perpetuating negative stereotypes, and instead focus on promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect.
6. Offer practical assistance: Provide practical support, such as meal preparation, childcare, or household tasks, to help alleviate some of the stress and burden associated with divorce.
7. Encourage self-care: Encourage recently divorced individuals to prioritize their own well-being by engaging in activities that promote relaxation, stress reduction, and overall self-care.
8. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that the process of divorce can be emotionally challenging and time-consuming. Be patient and understanding when interacting with recently divorced individuals, and avoid putting pressure on them to "get over it" or "move on."
