Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Spanish speaker mixed Hispanic heritage individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach that takes into account their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the diversity of mixed heritage individuals: Mixed heritage individuals may identify with multiple cultures, each with its own cultural practices, traditions, and values. It's essential to recognize and respect this diversity and avoid making assumptions based on a person's appearance or name.
2. Involve diverse communities in program planning: Engage with mixed heritage communities, organizations, and leaders to ensure that programs are inclusive and representative of their experiences. This can involve surveys, focus groups, or other forms of community outreach.
3. Offer culturally responsive programming: Develop cultural programs that reflect the diverse backgrounds and identities of mixed heritage individuals. This may include incorporating music, dance, art, or other cultural expressions from different Hispanic countries or regions.
4. Provide language support: Many mixed heritage individuals may speak multiple languages, including Spanish, English, and other languages spoken in their family's country of origin. Provide translation services or bilingual programming to ensure that all participants can fully engage with the cultural programs.
5. Address intersectionality: Mixed heritage individuals may experience intersecting identities such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and disability. Be aware of these intersections and create programs that are inclusive of all participants' identities.
6. Create safe spaces: Provide safe and inclusive spaces for mixed heritage individuals to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of marginalization or tokenization. This can involve creating separate spaces for different communities or incorporating elements of cultural competency training into program curricula.
7. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Cultural programs should be not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process of learning and growth. Encourage open communication and feedback from participants, and be willing to adapt and evolve programs based on community input.
8. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage mutual respect and understanding between different cultural groups. Programs can involve intercultural dialogue, collaborative art projects, or other activities that promote cultural exchange
