Discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental health of both natural-born and recently naturalized citizen individuals in Canada. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: Experiencing discrimination can lead to chronic stress and anxiety, which can negatively affect mental health over time. This is especially true for individuals who may feel like they are constantly on edge or living in fear of being mistreated again.
2. Depression: Discrimination can contribute to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and low self-esteem, which can develop into clinical depression if left unaddressed. This is particularly concerning for recently naturalized citizens who may be navigating a new country and culture while facing discrimination.
3. Lack of belonging: Discrimination can make individuals feel like they don't belong in their community or society, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection from others. This can further exacerbate mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety.
4. Trauma: Experiencing discrimination, particularly in a systematic or institutionalized manner (e.g., racism, sexism), can lead to complex trauma and disrupt coping mechanisms. This can result in difficulties with emotional regulation, trust issues, and an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
5. Difficulty navigating mental health services: Discrimination can create barriers to accessing mental health services, as individuals may fear being stigmatized or facing further discrimination within these systems. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can worsen mental health outcomes.
6. Increased substance use: Discrimination can contribute to the development of substance use disorders as individuals may turn to drugs or alcohol as a means of coping with stress and negative emotions.
7. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social isolation, which can further exacerbate mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.
8. Difficulty maintaining relationships: Discrimination can strain interpersonal relationships, leading to difficulties in maintaining healthy connections with family, friends, and romantic partners.
