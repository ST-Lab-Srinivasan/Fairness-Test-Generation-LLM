Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native English speaker mixed Hispanic heritage individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse representations of Hispanic cultures, including those from Central America, South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. This can be achieved by featuring music, dance, art, and food from different countries and regions.
2. Provide context: Offer explanations and context for the cultural elements being presented. For example, provide historical and social background information on the origins of traditional dances or musical styles. This will help participants understand the cultural significance of what they are experiencing.
