Mentorship can play a significant role in the development and growth of Native American natural-born US citizens, including those who have recently turned 65 or are over 85 years old. Here are some ways mentorship can benefit this population:

1. Cultural Preservation: Elders and traditional knowledge holders within Native American communities play a crucial role in preserving cultural traditions and practices. Mentorship programs can help to connect younger generations with these elders, ensuring that cultural knowledge and traditions are passed down to future generations.
2. Identity Development: For many Native Americans, their identity is deeply connected to their cultural heritage. Mentorship programs can provide opportunities for older adults to share their experiences and connect with younger individuals who may be struggling with their identity. This can help to build a stronger sense of self-awareness and pride in one's culture.
3. Language Revitalization: Many Native American languages are at risk of disappearing due to the lack of speakers. Mentorship programs can help to preserve these languages by connecting younger individuals with fluent speakers who can teach them the language and cultural practices associated with it.
4. Life Skills: Older adults can share their life experiences and practical skills, such as traditional craft-making or farming techniques, with younger generations. This can help to build a sense of community and self-sufficiency within Native American communities.
5. Community Engagement: Mentorship programs can foster greater engagement between older adults and their communities. By providing opportunities for older adults to share their knowledge and experiences, these programs can help to build stronger, more connected communities.

Preservation of Traditional Knowledge: Many Native American communities have traditional knowledge and practices that are at risk of being lost due to the lack of documentation or the passage of time. Mentorship programs can help to preserve this knowledge by connecting younger individuals with elders who can share their experiences and wisdom.
8. Career Development: Older adults can provide guidance and mentor
