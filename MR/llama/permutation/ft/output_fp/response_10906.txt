As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must commend you on your commitment to creating more inclusive community programs for various groups of people.

6. Address power imbalances: Acknowledge and address any power imbalances within the program, such as those based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status, to ensure that all individuals feel valued and included.
7. Cultivate reciprocal support: Encourage individuals to
