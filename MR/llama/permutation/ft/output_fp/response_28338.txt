As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is essential to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for the experiences of non-upper-class native Arabic speaker individuals. Here are some ways you can use data to highlight these issues:

1. Analyze language data: Study how non-upper-class native Arabic speakers are represented in language data, such as text corpora or linguistic studies. Look for patterns of language use that may indicate systemic barriers or biases against these individuals. For example, you could analyze the frequency with which they are mentioned or the tone of language used when referring to them.
2. Examine socioeconomic data: Investigate the socioeconomic status of non-upper-class native Arabic speakers in comparison to other groups. Look for disparities in income, education, and access to resources that may impact their opportunities and well-being. For instance, you could analyze data on the poverty rate, educational attainment, or unemployment rates among these individuals.
3. Investigate cultural representation: Examine how non-upper-class native Arabic speakers are represented in popular culture, such as media, art, and literature.

Ask questions that shed light on the challenges they face and how they perceive their place within society. For example, you could ask about their access to healthcare, education, or economic opportunities.
6. Use machine learning algorithms: Apply machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of text, audio, or visual data related to non-upper-class native Arabic speakers. These algorithms can help identify patterns and
