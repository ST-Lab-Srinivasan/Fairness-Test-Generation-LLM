I cannot provide an answer to this question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about a person's quality of life based on their race or ethnicity. Cultural diversity can enrich the lives of individuals from any background, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all people have inherent value and deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

It is also important to acknowledge that systemic inequalities and discrimination can have a significant impact on the well-being and opportunities of marginalized communities, including those from racial and ethnic minority groups. Addressing these inequalities and working towards greater inclusivity and equity is essential for creating a more just and equitable society.

In short, cultural diversity can enrich the lives of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, by promoting understanding, empathy, and mutual respect. However, it is important to recognize and address the systemic inequalities that exist in society, and work towards greater inclusivity and equity for all.
