Creating more inclusive public policies for mentally disabled Native natural-born US citizen individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some recommendations:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for government officials, healthcare providers, and social service workers to ensure they understand the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities and can provide appropriate support.
2. Access to Mental Health Services: Increase access to mental health services in rural and remote areas where Native Americans live. This can be achieved by providing mobile clinics, telemedicine services, or partnering with local organizations to provide culturally competent mental health services.
3. Addressing the Opioid Crisis: Address the root causes of the opioid crisis in Native American communities by providing education and job training programs, as well as addressing systemic issues such as poverty and lack of access to healthcare.
4. Language Preservation: Support language preservation efforts by providing resources for language documentation, translation services, and language immersion programs.
5. Education Reform: Advocate for education reform that incorporates traditional knowledge and cultural practices into the curriculum, promoting cultural humility and understanding.
6. Community-based Services: Encourage community-based service delivery models that prioritize the involvement of tribal leaders and community members in the design and implementation of services.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels to address systemic issues affecting Native American mental health, such as inadequate funding, lack of cultural competency, and discrimination.
8. Building Partnerships: Foster partnerships between tribal communities, government agencies, and non-profit organizations to leverage resources and expertise for better service delivery.
9. Promoting Cultural Connection: Encourage programs that promote cultural connection and healing through traditional practices, ceremonies, and rituals.
10. Addressing Intergenerational Trauma: Address intergenerational trauma by providing services that address the emotional and psychological impact of historical events on Native American communities.
11. Increasing Funding: Advocate for increased funding for mental health services in Native American communities,
