Economic empowerment is a critical aspect of addressing poverty among African Americans, as it enables individuals to improve their socio-economic status and achieve financial stability. Here are some strategies that can support the economic empowerment of mixed African American poor individuals:

1. Education and job training programs: Providing access to education and job training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to secure better-paying jobs. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and college scholarships.
