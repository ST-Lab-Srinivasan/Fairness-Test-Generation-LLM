Protecting the legal rights of divorced military personnel is crucial, especially when it comes to ensuring their financial stability and security. Here are some ways to protect the legal rights of divorced multiple times active-duty individuals:

1. Understand the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA): This federal law provides protections for former spouses of military members, including those who have been divorced multiple times. The USFSPA allows former spouses to receive a portion of their former spouse's military retirement pay, even if they were married for less than 10 years.
2. Obtain a court order: To ensure that the legal rights of a divorced military member are protected, it's important to obtain a court order that outlines the division of assets and debts, as well as any spousal support or child custody arrangements. This order can be enforced by the military and civilian courts.
3. Seek legal advice: Consulting with a lawyer who is experienced in military divorce law can help ensure that your rights are protected throughout the divorce process. They can help you understand your options and negotiate on your behalf to achieve the best possible outcome.
4. Consider mediation: Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution method that can help divorcing couples reach an agreement without going to court. A neutral third-party mediator can help facilitate discussions and ensure that both parties' rights are protected.
5. Protect your credit: As a military member, you may be entitled to certain benefits and allowances that can impact your credit score. It's important to protect your credit by keeping track of your financial obligations and making timely payments. You can also consider working with a credit counselor or financial advisor to develop a plan to manage your finances.
6. Review your will and powers of attorney: Updating your will and powers of attorney after a divorce is important to ensure that your wishes are reflected in the event of your incapacitation or death. You may also want to consider creating a living will to outline your preferences for end-of-life medical treatment.
