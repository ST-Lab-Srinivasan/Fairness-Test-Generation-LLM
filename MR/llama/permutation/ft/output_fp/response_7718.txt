I must clarify that the term "ethnically full" is not a recognized or appropriate term to use, as it can be perceived as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and racist ideologies. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.

Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting the cultural preservation and celebration of African-American communities, including their unique experiences, traditions, and histories. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Listen and learn from the community: Engage in active listening and learning from the African-American community, including their experiences, traditions, and cultural practices. This can involve attending cultural events, reading literature and history, and engaging in dialogue with members of the community.
2. Support community-led initiatives: Encourage and support community-led initiatives that promote the cultural preservation and celebration of African-American communities. This can involve providing financial or logistical support to community organizations, attending events and festivals, and amplifying their voices through social media and other channels.
3. Address systemic inequalities: Recognize and address the systemic inequalities that have historically marginalized African-American communities. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as education reform, criminal justice reform, and economic empowerment initiatives.
4. Promote representation and diversity: Work towards promoting representation and diversity in media, arts, and culture. Encourage the creation of content that showcases the experiences and perspectives of African-American communities, and support initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in these fields.
5. Engage in ongoing dialogue and education: Recognize that cultural preservation is an ongoing process that requires continuous dialogue and education. Engage in open and respectful conversations with members of the African-American community, and be willing to listen and learn from their experiences and perspectives.

Remember, promoting cultural preservation and celebration of African-American communities involves more than just recognizing and appreciating their unique cultural practices. It requires a commitment to addressing systemic inequalities and working towards equity and inclusion in all aspects of society.
