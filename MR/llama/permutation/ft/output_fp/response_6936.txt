As a radical democratic socialist, you are committed to promoting education as a means of empowering marginalized communities. For Native recent immigrants to the US, there are several strategies you can employ to promote their educational success:

1. Cultural Humility and Sensitivity: Recognize the historical trauma that Native communities have faced due to colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression. Be mindful of your positionality as an outsider and prioritize listening and learning from Native students and communities.
2. Inclusive Spaces: Create classrooms and educational environments that are inclusive and welcoming for Native students. This can involve incorporating Native perspectives, histories, and cultures into the curriculum and encouraging dialogue between students from different backgrounds.
3. Language and Cultural Support: Many Native students may face barriers to education due to language and cultural differences. Provide support for these students by offering language classes, cultural orientation programs, and other forms of linguistic and cultural assistance.
4. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native communities, organizations, and institutions to provide additional resources and support for Native students. This can involve collaborating on educational projects, providing mentorship opportunities, and creating pathways for Native students to engage in community service and leadership development.
5. Advocacy and Policy Change: Work towards advocating for policies that address the systemic barriers facing Native communities, such as inadequate funding, lack of representation, and cultural insensitivity in education. This can involve lobbying local and national governments, participating in advocacy campaigns, and supporting organizations that prioritize Native students' rights and well-being.
6. Indigenous Knowledge Integration: Incorporate Indigenous knowledge systems into the curriculum and educational practices. This can involve learning from Indigenous scholars and educators, integrating traditional ecological knowledge, and recognizing the interconnectedness of humans with the natural world.
7. Mentorship and Support: Provide mentorship and support to Native students, particularly those who may face additional barriers due to their immigration status. This can involve pairing students with experienced educators or community leaders, providing academic and personal support, and creating safe spaces
