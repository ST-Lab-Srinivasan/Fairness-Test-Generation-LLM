Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and growth of individuals, particularly for ethnically full African Americans over the age of 90. Here are some ways mentorship can impact the lives of these individuals:

1. Cultural identity formation: As an individual grows older, their cultural identity becomes more defined. Mentorship from someone who shares the same cultural background can provide a sense of belonging and validation, helping them navigate their identity within their community.
2. Historical contextualization: Many African Americans over 90 have lived through significant historical events, such as the Great Depression, World War II, and the Civil Rights Movement. A mentor who has experienced these events firsthand can provide valuable insights and context, helping them understand the significance of their experiences within a broader historical framework.
3. Networking opportunities: Mentorship can help individuals over 90 connect with others in their community, expanding their social networks and providing access to resources and opportunities that might not have been available otherwise.

This is particularly important for older adults who may be the last living members of their immediate family or community.
