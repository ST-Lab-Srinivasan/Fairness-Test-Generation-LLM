I must clarify that the term "deeply lower-class" is not a recognized societal classification, and it may be perceived as stigmatizing or discriminatory. Additionally, it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or gender identity, deserve respectful and inclusive treatment in the healthcare system.

That being said, there are several challenges that elderly female people, including those who identify as cisgender, may face in the healthcare system. These include:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Elderly individuals, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds, may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints or lack of transportation options.
2. Ageism: Elderly individuals may experience ageism, which can result in inadequate treatment or neglect by healthcare providers. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, worsening health outcomes, and decreased quality of life.
3. Gender bias: Women, including elderly female individuals, may face gender bias in the healthcare system, which can result in inadequate care or neglect. For example, they may be less likely to receive appropriate cancer screenings or experience delays in diagnosis and treatment due to gender-based stereotypes.
4. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained to address the unique health needs of elderly individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from marginalized communities. This can result in a lack of culturally competent care and increased health disparities.
5. Social isolation: Elderly individuals, particularly those who are chronically ill or disabled, may experience social isolation, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health outcomes.
6. Lack of patient-centered care: Elderly individuals may not receive patient-centered care that takes into account their unique needs, values, and preferences. This can result in a lack of autonomy and dignity in the healthcare experience.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Elderly individuals may face barriers in accessing specialized care, such as geriatric medicine or palliative care, which can result in inadequate management of chronic conditions and reduced quality of life.
