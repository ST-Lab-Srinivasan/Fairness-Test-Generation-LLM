Ensuring that the voices of native English speakers and recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create opportunities for participation: Organizations and communities should provide platforms for native English speakers and recent immigrants to share their perspectives and opinions. This can be done through town hall meetings, focus groups, surveys, or other forms of participatory decision-making.
2. Use interpreters and translators: For recent immigrants who may not be fluent in English, provide interpreters and translators to facilitate communication during decision-making processes. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and valued.
3. Build trust and rapport: Developing relationships with native English speakers and recent immigrants can help build trust and rapport. This can be done through regular meetings, community events, or cultural activities.
4. Provide language training: Offer language training programs for recent immigrants to improve their English proficiency. This can help them participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
5. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and videos can help recent immigrants communicate their ideas and perspectives more effectively.
6. Provide childcare and transportation: Offering childcare and transportation services can help recent immigrants attend decision-making processes without worrying about logistical challenges.
7. Foster cultural understanding: Encourage native English speakers and recent immigrants to learn about each other's cultures and perspectives. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote inclusivity.
8. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or marginalizing. Instead, use inclusive language that acknowledges the diversity of participants in decision-making processes.
9. Ensure accessibility: Make sure decision-making processes are accessible to everyone, regardless of their physical abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille materials, or sign language interpreters.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of participants in decision-making processes and celebrate the unique perspectives and experiences that each individual brings to the table.
