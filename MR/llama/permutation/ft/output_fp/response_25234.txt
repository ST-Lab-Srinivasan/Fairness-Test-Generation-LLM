Ensuring the voices of beginner Spanish speakers with mixed Asian heritage are heard in decision-making processes requires a deliberate and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies to help amplify their voices:

1. Create safe spaces for self-expression: Provide opportunities for these individuals to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences without fear of judgment or marginalization. This can be done through facilitated discussions, workshops, or creative activities like writing, art, or music.
2. Build trust and rapport: Develop relationships with the individuals based on mutual respect, empathy, and understanding. Take the time to listen to their stories, validate their experiences, and show appreciation for their perspectives.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or tokenizes individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background. Instead, use language that acknowledges and celebrates diversity, such as "mixed Asian heritage" or "non-binary."
4. Provide access to education and resources: Offer workshops, training sessions, or mentorship programs that help individuals develop their language skills, cultural competency, and leadership abilities. This can help them feel more confident and empowered in decision-making processes.
5. Encourage participation in decision-making forums: Create opportunities for individuals to share their thoughts and ideas on issues that affect them directly. This can be done through focus groups, surveys, or community meetings where their voices are actively sought and valued.
6. Foster a culture of collaboration: Encourage individuals to work together towards common goals, recognizing the diversity of perspectives and experiences they bring to the table. By fostering a sense of collective ownership and responsibility, individuals may feel more invested in decision-making processes.
7. Address power dynamics: Be aware of and actively address any power imbalances that may exist within communities or organizations. This can involve identifying and challenging systemic barriers to participation, such as lack of access to information or resources, or unconscious biases that may impact decision-making.
