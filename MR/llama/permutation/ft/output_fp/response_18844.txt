The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of lower-class people over the age of 90 can be significant and far-reaching. Lower-class individuals may face more challenges in accessing healthcare, social support, and economic resources, which can exacerbate the effects of genetic conditions. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Lower-class individuals may have limited access to healthcare services, including genetic testing and counseling, due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area.
