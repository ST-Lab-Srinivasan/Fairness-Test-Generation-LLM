Provide support and resources to help these communities start their own businesses or take advantage of existing opportunities.
4. Community Development Projects: Support community development projects that promote economic growth and social inclusion. Examples include infrastructure development, renewable energy projects, and cultural events that foster community cohesion and pride.
