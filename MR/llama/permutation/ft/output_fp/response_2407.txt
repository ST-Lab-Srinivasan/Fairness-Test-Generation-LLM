As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, deserve equal access to quality healthcare. However, historically and currently, non-middle-class ethnically full African Americans face unique challenges in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the challenges they encounter:

1. Limited access to care: Non-middle-class ethnically full African Americans may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited healthcare providers in their area. They may have to travel long distances to see a provider, which can be difficult for those with limited financial resources.
2. Cultural barriers: There may be cultural and language barriers that hinder effective communication between healthcare providers and patients from diverse backgrounds. Healthcare providers may not always understand the unique healthcare needs and practices of non-middle-class ethnically full African Americans, leading to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment.
3. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in the US healthcare system, affecting non-middle-class ethnically full African Americans. They may experience racial profiling, implicit bias, or outright discrimination when seeking medical care. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, compromising their health outcomes.
4. Health disparities: Non-middle-class ethnically full African Americans may face significant health disparities due to systemic barriers and biases. For example, they may experience higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease compared to the general population.
5. Lack of culturally competent care: Non-middle-class ethnically full African Americans may not receive culturally competent care due to a lack of healthcare providers who understand their cultural background and practices. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, or inadequate treatment.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Non-middle-class ethnically full African Americans may have limited access to specialized care, such as oncology, cardiology, or neurology, due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area
