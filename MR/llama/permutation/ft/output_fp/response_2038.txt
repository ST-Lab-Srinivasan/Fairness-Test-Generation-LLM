Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native French speaker, ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures. Avoid using terms or phrases that stereotype or marginalize any particular group. For example, use "Native French speaker" instead of "French Canadian" to include all individuals who are native speakers of French.
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the community. Include artists, performers, and cultural practitioners from different Asian backgrounds in your programming. This can help create a more inclusive environment for participants and audience members.
3. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for staff and volunteers involved in the cultural programs. This can help them understand and appreciate the diverse cultural practices and traditions of the communities they serve.
4. Community Engagement: Engage with the local Asian community to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account when designing cultural programs. This can involve holding focus groups, surveys, or consultations with community members to gather feedback and insights.
5. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to all participants, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials for participants who require them.
6. Intersectionality: Consider the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other factors that may impact a person's experience in cultural programs. Be mindful of how these intersections may affect access to and participation in cultural programs.
7. Celebrating Diversity: Celebrate the diversity of Asian cultures by incorporating different traditions, customs, and practices into your programming. Highlight the unique contributions and experiences of each culture, while also acknowledging the shared histories and struggles of marginalized communities.
8. Collaboration: Collaborate with community organizations and leaders to co-create cultural programs that are responsive to the needs and preferences of the local Asian community. This can help build trust and legitimacy in the eyes of community members.
9. Education and Awareness:
