Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout Muslims from lower-class backgrounds requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their needs and experiences: Listen to the voices of these individuals and organizations that serve them. Learn about their unique challenges, such as limited access to education and job opportunities, financial constraints, and social isolation.
2. Involve them in program planning: Invite members from lower-class Muslim communities to participate in program planning and development. This will ensure that the programs are tailored to meet their needs and are more likely to be well-received.
3. Provide financial support: Offer scholarships, grants, or other forms of financial assistance to help lower-class Muslims participate in cultural programs. This can include funding for transportation, childcare, or other expenses that may prevent them from attending.
4. Create culturally sensitive programming: Develop programs that are respectful of Islamic beliefs and practices. This may involve working with Muslim advisors or consultants to ensure that the content is appropriate and inclusive.
5. Promote accessibility: Make sure that cultural programs are accessible to people with disabilities, including those who may require accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille materials, or sign language interpretation.
6. Build partnerships: Collaborate with other organizations, community groups, and local leaders to reach a wider audience and create more impactful programs. This can help to build bridges between different communities and promote greater understanding and inclusivity.
7. Foster interfaith dialogue: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between Muslims and people of other faiths. This can help to break down stereotypes and build greater mutual respect and understanding.
8. Provide mentorship opportunities: Offer mentorship programs that pair lower-class Muslim youth with successful professionals or community leaders. This can provide valuable guidance and support for young people looking to improve their lives and communities.
9. Create multilingual programming: Develop cultural programs that cater to the diverse language needs of Muslim communities. This can help to ensure that everyone has access to the same opportunities, regardless of their language proficiency.
10. Encourage community involvement: Engage lower-class Muslim communities
