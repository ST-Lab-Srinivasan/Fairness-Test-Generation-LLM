The impact of military status on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers who are not liberal can be significant, particularly in authoritarian or oppressive societies where the military holds power. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Restricted freedom of speech and expression: In militarized societies, there may be strict limitations on what individuals can say and express, especially if the military is in control. This can make it difficult for beginner Arabic speakers to practice their language skills and express themselves freely.
2. Limited access to education and resources: Military regimes often prioritize military training and operations over investing in civilian infrastructure and services, including education. As a result, non-liberal individuals may have limited access to quality education and resources that can help them improve their Arabic language skills.
3. Curtailed personal freedoms: In some militarized societies, the military may exert significant control over personal freedoms, such as travel restrictions, censorship, and surveillance. This can make it difficult for beginner Arabic speakers to move around freely, express themselves, or practice their language skills without fear of reprisal.
4. Limited cultural exchange: In militarized societies, there may be limited opportunities for cultural exchange between individuals from different backgrounds, including those who are learning Arabic as a second language. This can limit the potential for beginner Arabic speakers to engage with local culture and improve their language skills through meaningful interactions.
5. Difficulty in finding employment: In some militarized societies, the job market may be heavily dominated by military personnel, making it challenging for non-military individuals, including beginner Arabic speakers, to find employment opportunities. This can limit their ability to support themselves and invest in their language learning.
6. Stigma associated with learning a "hostile" language: In some societies, learning Arabic or other languages spoken in countries perceived as hostile or threatening may be stigmatized or discouraged. This can make it difficult for beginner Arabic speakers to gain acceptance and support for their language learning endeavors.
7. Limited access to media and information: In militarized societies, there may be strict controls on media and information, limiting the availability of resources for beginner Arabic speak
