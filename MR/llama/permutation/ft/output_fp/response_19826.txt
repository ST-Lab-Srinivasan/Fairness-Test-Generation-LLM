Protecting the legal rights of Native American natural-born US citizens is crucial to ensuring their full and equal participation in society. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Recognition of Tribal Sovereignty: The US government should recognize and respect the sovereignty of Native American tribes, including their right to govern themselves, make laws, and enforce them on their reservations. This recognition is essential for protecting the legal rights of Native Americans.
2. Indian Citizenship Act: The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 should be amended to remove the "blood quantum" requirement, which denies citizenship to individuals who have Native American ancestry but do not meet the blood quantum requirement. This would ensure that all Native Americans are recognized as US citizens with full rights and protections under the law.
3. Voting Rights: Native Americans should have equal access to voting rights and representation in government. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has helped protect the voting rights of Native Americans, but more needs to be done to ensure that they have a fair and meaningful voice in the political process.

This can be achieved through education programs, cultural centers, and other initiatives that foster cultural understanding and appreciation.
5. Reparations: The US government should provide reparations to Native Americans for the historical injustices they have suffered, including forced relocation, genocide, and cultural suppression. Reparations could take various forms, such as financial compensation, land restitution, or educational and economic development programs.
6. Education Reform: The US education system should prioritize culturally responsive teaching practices that recognize the importance of Native American cultural identity and historical experiences. This can help close the educational gap between Native American students and their non-Native peers.
7. Employment Opportunities: The US government should work to create employment opportunities for Native Americans in fields such as healthcare, education, and economic development. This can help reduce poverty and improve the overall well-being of Native American communities.
8. Criminal Justice Reform: The US
