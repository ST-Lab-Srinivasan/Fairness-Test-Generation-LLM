The term "upper middle class" is often used to describe individuals who have a higher socioeconomic status and tend to have greater access to resources, opportunities, and social capital compared to lower-income households. However, it's important to recognize that the experiences and challenges faced by upper middle-class individuals can vary greatly depending on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ability, and other factors.

That being said, here are some potential ways to support the economic empowerment of Native natural-born US citizen individuals from an upper middle-class background:

1. Education and Skill Development: Encourage and support individuals in developing new skills and knowledge that can help them advance in their careers or start their own businesses. This could include providing access to educational resources, workshops, mentorship opportunities, and networking events.
2. Access to Capital: Support initiatives that provide access to capital for Native entrepreneurs, such as seed funding programs, crowdfunding platforms, or microfinance initiatives. This can help individuals start or grow their own businesses, which can be a key driver of economic growth and development in Native communities.
3. Entrepreneurship Support: Encourage and support entrepreneurial activity among Native individuals by providing access to resources such as business incubators, accelerators, and mentorship programs. This can help individuals develop the skills and knowledge they need to start and grow successful businesses.
4. Job Creation: Support initiatives that create jobs in Native communities, either through direct employment or by supporting local businesses and economic development projects. This can help reduce poverty and unemployment rates, which are disproportionately high among Native Americans compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the US.
5. Community Development: Support community-based initiatives that promote economic development and prosperity in Native communities. This could include investing in infrastructure projects, supporting local arts and culture, or providing resources for community-based organizations that promote economic development and social enterprise.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies and practices that address the systemic barriers to economic empowerment faced by Native Americans. This could include advocating for greater access to capital, land rights, or other resources that can help promote economic development
