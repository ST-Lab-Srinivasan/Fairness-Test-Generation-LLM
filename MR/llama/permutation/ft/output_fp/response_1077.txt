Creating more inclusive community events for former soldier high earners (HCEs) requires understanding their unique needs, preferences, and challenges. Here are some suggestions to make your event more welcoming and accessible:

1. Inclusive language and marketing: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. Avoid using gendered or ableist terms, and instead use language that is neutral and respectful.
2. Accessibility features: Ensure that the event space is accessible to people with disabilities. Provide wheelchair access, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
3. Childcare and family-friendly activities: HCEs may have families and dependents, so provide childcare services or organize family-friendly activities during the event.
4. Food options: Cater to a variety of dietary needs, including vegetarian, gluten-free, and halal options. Offer water and non-alcoholic drinks, as some attendees may not consume alcohol for personal or religious reasons.
5. Diverse programming: Organize activities and workshops that cater to different interests and hobbies, such as fitness classes, art therapy sessions, or financial planning workshops. This will help ensure that everyone finds something engaging and relevant to their lives.
6. Safe space policies: Establish a safe space policy for attendees who may feel uncomfortable or marginalized due to their identity or experiences. Provide a clear process for reporting incidents and ensuring accountability.
7. Mental health support: Recognize that HCEs may have experienced trauma or mental health challenges related to their military service or other factors. Offer resources and support for mental health, such as counseling services or peer support groups.
8. Technology accessibility: Provide options for attendees who may not have access to technology, such as a public computer lab or printed materials. Ensure that any digital content is accessible via assistive technologies like screen readers.
9. Intersectional programming: Avoid tokenizing or marginalizing specific groups within the HCE community. Instead, focus on creating inclusive experiences that address the diverse needs
