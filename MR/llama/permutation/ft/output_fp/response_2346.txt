Temporary visa holders who are independent individuals with disabilities may face a range of challenges and barriers in their daily lives. Here are some of the potential impacts of disability status on these individuals:

1. Access to healthcare: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to healthcare services, including specialized disability services, due to their immigration status. This can lead to delays or lack of access to medical care, which can exacerbate existing conditions or make it difficult to manage new ones.
2. Employment discrimination: Discrimination based on disability status is illegal in many countries, but temporary visa holders may still face barriers when seeking employment due to their immigration status. This can limit their ability to support themselves financially and achieve financial stability.
3. Social isolation: Temporary visa holders may experience social isolation due to their limited access to social networks and community resources. This can be particularly challenging for individuals with disabilities who may already face barriers in accessing social spaces and services.
4. Lack of accommodations: Many countries have laws and policies in place to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities, but temporary visa holders may not have the same level of access to these accommodations as permanent residents. This can include difficulties with transportation, housing, and other aspects of daily life.
5. Limited legal protection: Temporary visa holders may have limited legal protections and recourse if they experience discrimination or encounter barriers in accessing services and resources. This can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights and seek redress when needed.
6. Stigma and stigmatization: Disability status can lead to stigma and stigmatization, which can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health and well-being. Temporary visa holders may face additional stigma due to their immigration status, leading to further marginalization and isolation.
7. Limited access to education: Temporary visa holders may face barriers in accessing educational resources and services, including specialized disability services, due to their immigration status. This can limit their ability to pursue higher education or vocational training, which can have long-term consequences for their employment prospects and financial stability
