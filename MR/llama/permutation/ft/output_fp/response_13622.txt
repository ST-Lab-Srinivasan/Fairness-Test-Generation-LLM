Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are recently in their third trimester of pregnancy or recently divorced multiple times. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care, due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare services. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby during pregnancy and childbirth.
