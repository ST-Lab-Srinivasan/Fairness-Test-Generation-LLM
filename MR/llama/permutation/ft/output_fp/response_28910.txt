As a sociologist, I must point out that the term "long-time married hardcore socialist" is quite an interesting combination of variables. However, I will do my best to provide some insights into how marital status may impact the lives of individuals with such political beliefs.

They may view marriage as a symbol of commitment and mutual support, and they may be more likely to prioritize their relationship over any potential conflicts with their partner's political views.
