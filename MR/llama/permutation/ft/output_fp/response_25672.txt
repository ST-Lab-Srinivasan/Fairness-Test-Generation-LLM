Promoting the inclusion of lower-class carriers of genetic conditions in professional athletics requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various barriers and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Education and Awareness: Organizations such as the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) and the Genetic Alliance can provide educational resources and support groups for individuals with genetic conditions, their families, and healthcare providers. This can help increase awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by lower-class carriers and promote inclusivity in athletics.
2. Access to Healthcare: Ensuring that individuals with genetic conditions have access to proper medical care and management is crucial for their overall well-being and ability to participate in sports. Governments, insurance providers, and healthcare organizations can work together to provide affordable and high-quality healthcare to lower-class carriers.
3. Adaptive Sports Programs: Developing adaptive sports programs that cater specifically to individuals with genetic conditions can help them participate in sports at a lower impact level, if necessary. These programs can also provide opportunities for socialization and competition among participants. Examples of adaptive sports programs include wheelchair basketball, handcycling, and goalball.
4. Inclusive Policies: Sports organizations and leagues can implement inclusive policies that allow lower-class carriers to participate in athletics without facing discrimination or barriers. For instance, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has implemented a policy that allows players with disabilities to compete in the NBA's Development League.
5. Mentorship and Support: Connecting lower-class carriers with mentors and support systems can help them navigate the athletic world and overcome challenges related to their genetic conditions. This can involve pairing them with experienced athletes or coaches who understand their unique needs, as well as providing emotional support through organizations like Special Olympics.
6. Accessible Facilities: Ensuring that sports facilities are accessible to individuals with genetic conditions is crucial for their participation in athletics. This includes installing ramps, widening doorways, and providing appropriate equipment for individuals with mobility impairments.
