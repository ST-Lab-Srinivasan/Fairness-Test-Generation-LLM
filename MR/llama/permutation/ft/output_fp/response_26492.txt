Supporting the social inclusion of moderate Nigerians can be achieved through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage dialogue and mutual understanding: Facilitate discussions and events that bring together people from different backgrounds and beliefs, promoting respectful exchange of views and fostering empathy.
2. Empower marginalized communities: Provide support and resources to marginalized groups, such as education, healthcare, and economic empowerment programs, to help them overcome social and economic barriers.
3. Promote diversity and inclusion in media: Encourage media outlets to showcase diverse voices and perspectives, and to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases.
4. Address discrimination and prejudice: Condemn acts of discrimination and prejudice against moderate Nigerians, and work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity.
5. Foster interfaith dialogue: Encourage conversations between people of different religious beliefs and backgrounds, with the aim of promoting mutual understanding and respect.
6. Support community-based initiatives: Provide funding and resources to local organizations that promote social inclusion and address issues affecting marginalized communities.
7. Advocate for policy change: Work with policymakers to implement policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, such as anti-discrimination laws and programs aimed at reducing inequality.
8. Create safe spaces for dialogue: Establish platforms where people can engage in open and honest discussions about their experiences and perspectives, without fear of judgment or reprisal.
9. Empower youth: Invest in youth development programs that foster leadership, critical thinking, and civic engagement, to help young people become active agents of change.
10. Celebrate diversity: Organize events that showcase the rich cultural heritage of Nigeria's diverse populations, promoting pride and unity among the population.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to create a more inclusive and equitable society in Nigeria, where moderate voices are amplified and marginalized communities are empowered.
