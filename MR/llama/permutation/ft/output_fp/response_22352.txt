As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that there is no specific term or phrase to describe someone who is "slightly old" or in their 50s. However, I understand your question and will provide information on the challenges faced by older immigrant natural-born US citizens in the legal system.

Older immigrants, including those in their 50s, may face unique challenges in the legal system due to various factors such as:

1. Language barriers: Older immigrants may have difficulty navigating the complexities of the US legal system due to language barriers. They may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents written in English.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Older immigrants may face challenges accessing legal resources such as free or low-cost legal clinics, which can limit their ability to obtain adequate legal representation.
3. Ageism: Unfortunately, older immigrants may encounter ageism in the legal system, where they are not taken seriously or are assumed to be less competent due to their age.
4. Difficulty with technology: Older immigrants may struggle with using technology, such as online legal resources or electronic court filings, which can create additional barriers in accessing legal services.
5. Health issues: Older immigrants may face health challenges that can affect their ability to navigate the legal system, such as mobility issues or cognitive decline.
6. Lack of knowledge about US laws and procedures: Older immigrants may be unfamiliar with the laws and procedures of the US legal system, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the system effectively.
7. Difficulty navigating complex legal issues: Older immigrants may face complex legal issues such as family law, estate planning, or immigration proceedings, which can be challenging to navigate, especially for those without prior legal experience.
8. Limited access to legal aid: Older immigrants may have limited access to free or low-cost legal aid services, which can make it difficult for them to obtain adequate legal representation.
9. Discrimination: Unfortunately, older immigrants may encounter discrimination in the legal system due to their age, race, ethnicity, or national origin.
