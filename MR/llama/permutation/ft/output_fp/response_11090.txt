Creating inclusive community programs for recently divorced, ultra-conservative individuals can be challenging, as it requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. However, here are some strategies that can help create a more welcoming environment:

1. Understand their beliefs and values: To create an inclusive program, it's essential to understand the beliefs and values of this group. Listen to their concerns, interests, and hobbies to tailor the program to their needs.
2. Foster a safe space: Ensure that the community program creates a safe and welcoming environment for all participants. This can be achieved by setting clear expectations and guidelines for behavior and communication.
3. Offer diverse activities: Provide a range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. For instance, offer both indoor and outdoor activities, such as gardening, painting, or sports.
4. Encourage peer-to-peer support: Ultra-conservative individuals may feel more comfortable sharing their experiences and emotions with peers who understand their beliefs and values. Encourage the formation of support groups where participants can connect with others who share similar backgrounds and perspectives.
5. Provide resources and referrals: Offer access to resources and referrals that can help address specific needs, such as counseling, legal aid, or financial assistance. This can help alleviate some of the stress and challenges faced by this group.
6. Be sensitive to cultural and religious beliefs: Respect the cultural and religious beliefs of ultra-conservative individuals by being sensitive to their practices and traditions. For example, accommodate dietary restrictions or provide separate spaces for men and women.
7. Involve community leaders: Engage local community leaders who can help promote the program within their networks. This can help increase participation and reduce the stigma associated with seeking support.
8. Offer flexible scheduling: Accommodate the schedules of ultra-conservative individuals by offering programs at times that are convenient for them. This can include weekend or evening programs, or even online sessions.
9. Use inclusive language and marketing: Use language and marketing materials that are respectful and inclusive of all participants. Avoid making assumptions based on gender
