Creating inclusive community events for older adults, including those in their 90s, requires careful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and enjoyable for this age group:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is wheelchair-accessible and has easy parking and transportation options. Provide seating options for those who may need them, such as comfortable chairs or benches. Offer assistive devices like hearing aids or communication tools for those with limited mobility or dexterity.
2. Social distancing: Older adults may be more vulnerable to illness, so it's essential to maintain social distancing measures during events. Encourage participants to keep a safe distance from each other and provide hand sanitizer stations throughout the event space.
3. Programming: Develop programs that cater to older adults' interests and abilities. Offer activities like gentle exercise, music therapy, or art classes that are suitable for their age group. Consider hiring professional entertainers or performers who specialize in working with older adults.
4. Volunteer support: Recruit volunteers who can provide additional support and assistance during the event. These volunteers can help with navigation, communication, and other tasks as needed.
5. Communication: Use clear and simple language when communicating information about the event to avoid confusion or frustration. Provide visual aids like posters, flyers, or videos that highlight important details, such as dates, times, and locations.
6. Transportation: Arrange for transportation services or provide shuttle buses to ensure older adults can easily attend and return home after the event.
7. Food and beverages: Offer a variety of food and beverage options that cater to older adults' dietary needs and preferences. Consider hiring a professional catering service that specializes in serving seniors.
8. Activities for caregivers: Provide activities and resources specifically designed for caregivers, who are often overlooked during community events. Offer workshops on topics like stress management, self-care, or financial planning to support their well-being.
9. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of older adults attending
