Creating more inclusive social policies for deep poverty among recently divorced individuals, particularly those who have been divorced multiple times, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the intersectionality of poverty: Deep poverty among recently divorced individuals is often intersectional, meaning it intersects with other forms of discrimination such as race, gender, sexuality, and disability. Policies should be designed to address these intersections and provide targeted support for marginalized groups.
2. Provide access to affordable housing: Housing insecurity is a significant challenge for recently divorced individuals, particularly those who have been divorced multiple times. Governments can establish affordable housing programs, provide financial assistance for rent or mortgage payments, and offer support for finding affordable housing options.
3. Strengthen social safety nets: Social safety nets such as unemployment insurance, disability benefits, and food assistance programs can help mitigate the financial impact of divorce on individuals. Governments can improve these programs by increasing funding, expanding eligibility criteria, and streamlining application processes.
4. Improve access to healthcare: Recently divorced individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to loss of insurance coverage or limited financial resources. Governments can establish universal healthcare systems, provide financial assistance for healthcare expenses, and promote community-based healthcare initiatives.
5. Foster economic empowerment: Many recently divorced individuals struggle to rebuild their financial stability after divorce. Governments can offer training programs, microfinance schemes, and small business loans to help them establish or grow a business, and provide mentorship opportunities for entrepreneurs.
6. Address systemic barriers: Discrimination, stigma, and social isolation can exacerbate poverty among recently divorced individuals. Governments can implement policies that address these systemic barriers by promoting diversity and inclusion, challenging gender stereotypes, and providing support for mental health and well-being.
7. Engage community organizations: Community organizations can play a crucial role in supporting recently divorced individuals who are experiencing poverty.
