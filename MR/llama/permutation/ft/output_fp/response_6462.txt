Having diverse perspectives in leadership roles, including those from recent immigrants to Canada and natural-born US citizens, can bring numerous benefits. Here are some of the advantages of having a diverse group of leaders:

1. Innovation and creativity: When leaders come from different backgrounds and experiences, they bring unique perspectives and ideas to the table. This diversity can lead to more innovative and creative problem-solving, as each leader is less likely to be limited by their own biases and assumptions.
2. Better decision-making: When leaders have diverse perspectives, they are better able to consider multiple viewpoints and make more informed decisions. This can help avoid groupthink and ensure that decisions are based on a broad range of experiences and knowledge.
3. Enhanced representation: Leaders from diverse backgrounds can better represent the interests and needs of different communities and stakeholders. For example, a leader who is an immigrant may be more attuned to the needs of other immigrants, while a natural-born US citizen may be more connected to the needs of their local community.
4. Improved communication: When leaders have diverse perspectives, they are better able to communicate with and understand different audiences. This can help build trust and credibility with various stakeholders, including employees, customers, and investors.
5. More inclusive culture: Leaders who come from diverse backgrounds can help create a more inclusive workplace culture, where everyone feels valued and respected. This can lead to higher employee satisfaction and engagement, as well as improved productivity and performance.
6. Better adaptability: When leaders are exposed to different cultures and experiences, they are better able to adapt to changing circumstances and navigate complex situations. This can help their organization stay competitive and respond effectively to challenges and opportunities.
7. Role model effect: Leaders from diverse backgrounds can serve as role models for other employees, particularly those from underrepresented groups. This can inspire and motivate these employees to pursue leadership roles themselves, leading to a more diverse and inclusive workplace.
8. Broader perspective on the market: Leaders who have experience in different markets or industries can bring a broader perspective to their organization's strategy and decision-making
