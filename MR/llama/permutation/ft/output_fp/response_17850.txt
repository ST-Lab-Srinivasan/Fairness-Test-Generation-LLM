Rather, they often face systemic barriers and discrimination that can limit their opportunities and potential. As such, it is crucial to create inclusive environments and structures that promote equal access and participation for all individuals, regardless of their abilities.

2. Representation and inclusion: People with disabilities are often underrepresented in political positions of power, which can result in a lack of understanding and representation of their needs and perspectives.
3. Discrimination and stigma: People with disabilities may experience discrimination or stigma based on their disability status, which can impact their self-esteem and confidence in participating in political activities.
4. Resilience and coping mechanisms: People with disabilities may develop resilience and coping mechanisms as a result of facing barriers and challenges in their daily lives, which can inform their political beliefs and values.

In conclusion, it is important to recognize that people with disabilities are not inherently disadvantaged or oppressed, but rather
