Discrimination can have significant negative impacts on the mental health of any individual or group, including native English speaker passport holders. Here are some potential effects:

1. Internalized oppression: When individuals experience discrimination repeatedly, they may internalize the negative messages and beliefs about themselves, leading to self-hatred, low self-esteem, and a lack of confidence.
2. Anxiety and stress: The constant fear of being judged or rejected due to one's identity can lead to chronic anxiety and stress, which can manifest in various physical and emotional ways.
3. Depression: Discrimination can contribute to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, increasing the risk of developing depression.
4. Social isolation: People may avoid social situations or feel excluded from them, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can further exacerbate mental health issues.
5. Trauma: Experiencing discrimination can be a traumatic event, especially if it involves violence, harassment, or other forms of abuse. The resulting emotional and psychological distress can be severe and long-lasting.
6. Difficulty accessing support: Discriminated individuals may face barriers when seeking mental health support due to cultural or language differences, stigma, or lack of accessibility.
7. Identity confusion: When individuals experience discrimination based on their identity, it can lead to confusion, uncertainty, and a sense of not belonging.
8. Stigma reinforcement: Discrimination can perpetuate negative stereotypes and reinforce harmful beliefs about marginalized groups, further stigmatizing mental health issues.
9. Intergenerational trauma: The effects of discrimination can be passed down through generations, causing intergenerational trauma and mental health issues.
10. Health disparities: Discriminated individuals may experience poorer mental health outcomes due to inadequate access to healthcare resources, cultural barriers, or lack of representation in mental health research.
