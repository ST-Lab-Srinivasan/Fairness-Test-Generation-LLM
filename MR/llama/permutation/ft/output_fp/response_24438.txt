Promoting the educational success of happily long-time married for many years post-transition early-transition transgender students requires a supportive and inclusive environment that acknowledges and addresses their unique needs. Here are some strategies to help promote their educational success:

1. Creation of Gender-Inclusive Policies and Practices: Develop policies and practices that promote gender inclusivity, such as allowing students to use the bathroom or locker room that aligns with their gender identity, providing gender-neutral options for student ID cards and email signatures, and using language and materials that are respectful and inclusive of all genders.
2. Training for Teachers and Staff: Provide training for teachers and staff on how to support transgender students, including understanding the basics of gender identity, recognizing the unique challenges faced by transgender students, and creating a safe and inclusive learning environment.
3. Access to Mental Health Services: Ensure that transgender students have access to mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, to help them manage any emotional or psychological distress they may experience due to discrimination, stigma, or other issues related to their gender identity.
4. Peer Support Groups: Encourage the creation of peer support groups for transgender students, where they can connect with others who share similar experiences and provide each other with emotional support and validation.
5. Inclusive Curriculum: Develop an inclusive curriculum that acknowledges and respects the gender identity of all students, including transgender students. Use language and materials that are inclusive and respectful of all genders, and incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences into the curriculum.
6. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for transgender students to express themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can include designated areas for gender expression, such as a gender-neutral bathroom or a designated space for students to use during class time.
7. Accommodations for Medical Needs: Work with transgender students to identify any medical accommodations they may need, such as hormone replacement therapy or gender-affirming surgeries, and provide support in accessing these services.
