Family support plays a crucial role in the success of out-of-work devout Muslims. In Islam, family is considered a fundamental unit of society, and Muslims are encouraged to prioritize their family relationships and provide support to one another. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to the success of out-of-work devout Muslims:

1. Emotional Support: Out-of-work devout Muslims may face emotional challenges, such as feelings of frustration, anxiety, and depression, due to their unemployment. Family members can provide emotional support by listening to their problems, offering words of encouragement, and helping them maintain a positive outlook.
2. Financial Support: Out-of-work devout Muslims may face financial difficulties, such as reduced income or debt, due to their unemployment. Family members can provide financial support by lending money, sharing resources, or helping with expenses.
