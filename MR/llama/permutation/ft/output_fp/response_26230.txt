The military status of an individual can have significant impacts on their life, particularly for those who work in non-liberal countries. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited job opportunities: In many non-liberal countries, the government tightly controls the economy and restricts the ability of individuals to pursue certain jobs or industries. As a result, military status can limit an individual's job opportunities, especially if they are not eligible for certain positions within the military.
2. Limited mobility: Military service can involve long periods of time spent away from home, which can impact an individual's personal and professional life. This can be particularly challenging for non-liberal countries where there may be limited job opportunities and social mobility outside of the military.
3. Dependence on the government: Military service often involves a significant amount of support from the government, including housing, food, and other benefits. However, this dependence on the government can limit an individual's autonomy and freedom to make choices about their life.
4. Limited civilian experience: Military service often involves a focus on military training and operations, which can limit an individual's exposure to civilian life and work experiences. This can impact their ability to adapt to civilian life upon leaving the military.
5. Social stigma: In some non-liberal countries, there may be social stigma associated with military service, particularly if the individual is not seen as fulfilling their "duty" to serve in the military. This can impact an individual's personal and professional life.
6. Limited access to education and training: Military service can limit an individual's access to education and training opportunities, especially if they are not eligible for certain positions within the military. This can impact their ability to advance professionally and personally.
7. Limited freedom of expression: In some non-liberal countries, there may be limitations on freedom of expression, which can impact an individual's ability to express themselves freely while in the military.
8. Dependence on a hierarchical structure: Military service often involves a strict hierarchy and chain of command, which can limit an individual's autonomy and independence. This can be particularly challenging for those who are used to a more democratic or egalitarian work environment.
