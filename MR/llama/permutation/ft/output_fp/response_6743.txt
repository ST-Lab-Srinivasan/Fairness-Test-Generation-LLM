Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian and non-newly married individuals requires thoughtful consideration of their needs and perspectives. Here are some strategies to make cultural celebrations more welcoming and enjoyable for everyone:

1. Understand and acknowledge different preferences and values: Recognize that not everyone may share the same cultural beliefs, values, or practices. Be open-minded and respectful of individual differences, and avoid imposing your own cultural norms on others.
2. Involve diverse perspectives in planning and decision-making: Encourage participation from a range of individuals, including those who may not identify as libertarians or newly married couples. This can help ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of diverse perspectives.
3. Provide accommodations for diverse dietary needs: Offer a variety of food options that cater to different dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or halal. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and comfortable during the celebration.
4. Create activities that are inclusive and fun for everyone: Plan activities that are enjoyable for a diverse group of people, such as games, music, or dance. Avoid activities that may be exclusive or uncomfortable for some individuals, like drinking or smoking.
5. Be mindful of language and cultural appropriation: Be aware of the language and cultural practices you use during the celebration, and avoid appropriating cultures that are not your own. Use language and practices that are respectful and inclusive of all individuals involved.
6. Celebrate diversity through music and performances: Incorporate music and performances that reflect the diverse backgrounds and cultures of the attendees. This can help create a festive atmosphere that is enjoyable for everyone.
7. Provide childcare or other accommodations for families: Offer support for families with young children or other caregiving needs, such as childcare services or quiet spaces for nursing or changing diapers. This can help ensure that families feel included and comfortable during the celebration.
8. Encourage participation and engagement: Create opportunities for everyone to participate and engage in the celebration, regardless of their cultural background or personal preferences
