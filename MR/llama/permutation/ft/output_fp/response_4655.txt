Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Mexican average earners are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including access, affordability, quality, and cultural sensitivity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Improve access to healthcare: Mexico's healthcare system has historically faced challenges in providing access to care, particularly for low-income populations. Increasing the number of healthcare facilities, especially in rural areas, and improving transportation infrastructure can help address this issue.
2. Reduce costs: Many Mexican citizens struggle to afford healthcare services due to high out-of-pocket expenses. Implementing cost-saving measures, such as negotiating lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies or implementing a more efficient billing system, can help make care more affordable.
3. Strengthen primary care: Primary care is often the first point of contact for patients seeking healthcare services.
