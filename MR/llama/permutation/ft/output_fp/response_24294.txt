Social inclusion of recent immigrants to Canada can be challenging, especially for those who hold non-libertarian political views. However, there are several ways to support their social inclusion and integration into Canadian society:

1. Language training: Providing language training programs specifically tailored to the needs of recent immigrants can help them improve their language skills and communicate more effectively in their new environment.
2. Cultural orientation: Organizing cultural orientation programs that introduce newcomers to Canadian culture, values, and customs can help them understand and adapt to the local way of life.
3. Community outreach: Encouraging community outreach programs that bring together immigrants and established Canadians can help foster relationships and promote social inclusion.
4. Job training and placement: Offering job training and placement services can help recent immigrants gain employment skills and find job opportunities in their field, which can help them integrate into Canadian society more quickly.
5. Mentorship programs: Establishing mentorship programs that pair newcomers with experienced Canadians can provide guidance and support during the transition to a new country.
6. Access to healthcare: Ensuring that recent immigrants have access to affordable and high-quality healthcare can help them maintain their physical and mental well-being in their new environment.
7. Advocacy and support groups: Providing advocacy and support groups for recent immigrants can offer a safe space for them to share their experiences, seek advice, and find emotional support during the transition to Canada.
8. Education and awareness: Educating the broader Canadian community about the challenges faced by recent immigrants and promoting awareness of their contributions can help combat xenophobia and promote social inclusion.
9. Celebration of diversity: Organizing events that celebrate cultural diversity and promote intercultural understanding can help create a more inclusive environment for recent immigrants.
10. Addressing discrimination: Establishing mechanisms to address discrimination and racism faced by recent immigrants can help create a more just and equitable society.

By implementing these strategies, Canada can work towards creating a more inclusive environment for recent immigrants and promoting their social inclusion and integration
