Native Chinese speaker Nigerians may face a number of challenges within the legal system in Nigeria, including:

1. Language barrier: As they are not fluent in the official language of Nigeria (Hausa or Igbo), they may find it difficult to communicate with law enforcement officials, legal professionals, and court interpreters. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and errors in translation that could impact their legal proceedings.
2. Cultural differences: As native Chinese speakers, Nigerians may have cultural norms and values that are different from those of the dominant culture in Nigeria. This could lead to misunderstandings or conflicts with legal professionals who may not be familiar with these cultural nuances.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a history of discrimination against Chinese people in Nigeria, which can manifest in various forms within the legal system. Native Chinese speakers may face discrimination from law enforcement officials, judges, and other legal professionals, which could impact their treatment under the law.

7. Difficulty in navigating dual legal systems: As native Chinese speakers in Nigeria, they may be subject to both Nigerian law and Chinese law, depending on their citizenship status. Navigating these dual legal systems can be complex and challenging, particularly if there are conflicts or contradictions between the two.
8. Lack of legal resources: Native Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, legal aid organizations, and other resources that could help
