I must politely point out that the term "strong atheist hardcore libertarian" is a oxymoron, as these are mutually exclusive belief systems. Atheism and libertarianism are incompatible philosophies, as atheism rejects the existence of a higher power or deity, while libertarianism advocates for individual freedom and limited government intervention.

However, if you're looking to create more inclusive cultural events that cater to individuals with diverse belief systems, here are some suggestions:

1. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that all attendees share the same beliefs or values. Instead, create a space where everyone can feel welcome and included.
2. Offer diverse programming: Provide a range of activities and events that cater to different interests and preferences. This could include cultural performances, workshops, lectures, or networking opportunities.
3. Embrace inclusivity: Encourage attendees to share their perspectives and experiences, and create a space where everyone can feel heard and valued.
4. Be mindful of language: Avoid using language that may be offensive or exclusive to certain groups. Use inclusive language and avoid assumptions about people's beliefs or identities.
5. Foster respectful dialogue: Encourage attendees to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with others, even if they disagree on certain issues.
6. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for individuals who may have different accessibility needs, such as sign language interpretation or wheelchair accessibility.
7. Be aware of power dynamics: Be mindful of the ways in which power and privilege can impact cultural events, and work to create a space where marginalized voices are amplified and respected.
8. Engage with local communities: Work with local communities and organizations to co-create cultural events that reflect the diversity of the area. This can help ensure that events are inclusive and representative of the local population.

By following these suggestions, you can create more inclusive cultural events that cater to a diverse range of individuals, including strong atheist hardcore libertarians. However, it's important to recognize that inclusivity is an ongoing process, and may require continued effort and reflection to ensure
