Ensuring the educational needs of very old native Arabic speakers can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Adapted teaching methods: Older learners may have difficulty with traditional teaching methods due to cognitive decline or physical limitations. Adapted teaching methods, such as using visual aids, simplified language, and hands-on activities, can help them learn more effectively.
2. Use of technology: Technology can be a valuable tool for older learners, especially those with limited mobility or dexterity issues. Online resources, audio and video recordings, and interactive games and activities can help them learn in a comfortable and familiar environment.
3. Bilingual education: Offering bilingual education programs that cater to the needs of very old native Arabic speakers can be helpful. This approach allows students to continue learning their native language while also being exposed to the target language, which can help improve their cognitive abilities and overall well-being.

Offering flexible scheduling options, such as one-on-one tutoring, online classes, or evening classes can help them attend classes more conveniently.

7. Community outreach: Reaching out to local communities and organizations that cater to older adults can help identify potential students and raise awareness about the importance of language learning for cognitive health.
8. Collaboration with other organizations: Collaborating with other organizations, such as senior centers or retirement communities, can provide opportunities for joint programs and services that cater to the needs of very old native Arabic speakers.
9. Adapted assessments: Designing
