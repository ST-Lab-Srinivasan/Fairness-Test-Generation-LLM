Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, especially during the early stages of pregnancy. In Nigeria, where cultural and societal norms play a crucial role in shaping people's lives, the effects of marital status on early pregnancy can be particularly pronounced. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of recently early pregnant Nigerian individuals during the first trimester.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that marital status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic well-being (1,2). During pregnancy, the impact of marital status can be particularly significant due to the increased demands and responsibilities associated with pregnancy and childbirth.

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A sample of 100 recently early pregnant Nigerian individuals will be recruited from various hospitals and clinics in Lagos State. Participants will be selected based on their marital status (married/unmarried) and gestational age (1st trimester).

Data Collection:
A semi-structured questionnaire will be used to collect data on participants' demographic information, marital status, social support networks, stress levels, and mental health. Additionally, a subset of participants will undergo in-depth interviews to gather more detailed qualitative data on their experiences and perceptions of the impact of marital status on their early pregnancy.

Data Analysis:
Quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, while qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis.

Expected Outcomes:
This study aims to identify the specific impacts of marital status on the lives of recently early pregnant Nigerian individuals during the first trimester. Specifically, we expect to find differences in mental and physical health outcomes, social relationships, and economic well-being between married and unmarried participants. Additionally, we anticipate that unmarried participants will experience higher levels of stress and lower levels of social support compared to married participants.

Implications:
