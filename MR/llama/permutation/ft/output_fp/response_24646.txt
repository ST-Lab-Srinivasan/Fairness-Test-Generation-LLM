5. Encourage social support: Suggest ways for the individual to connect with others who have gone through similar experiences, such as peer support groups or online forums.
6. Help them set realistic goals: Encourage the person to set achievable goals for themselves, both short-term and long-term. Help them break down these goals into smaller, manageable steps.
7. Offer practical help: Assist the person with practical tasks such as grocery shopping or household chores, which can help reduce stress and promote relaxation.
8. Be patient: Recognize that healing from multiple divorces takes time, and be patient with the individual as they navigate this process.
