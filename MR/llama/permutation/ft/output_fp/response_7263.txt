However, there are several challenges that beginner Chinese speakers from ethnically full African-American communities may face in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who do not speak English fluently, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging. They may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can negatively impact their cases.

For example, in some African cultures, direct eye contact is considered disrespectful, while in the US, it is seen as a sign of confidence and respect. Understanding these cultural differences can help to avoid misunderstandings and ensure that clients receive appropriate legal representation.
