Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide multilingual signage and information: Offer signs, labels, and other information in multiple languages, including simplified Chinese characters (used by most non-native speakers) and traditional Chinese characters (used by some non-native speakers). This will help non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers navigate public spaces more easily.
2. Use visual aids: Incorporate pictures, diagrams, or other visual aids to convey information in a way that is accessible to beginners. For example, using icons or illustrations to explain how to use public transportation can be helpful.
3. Offer language classes or workshops: Provide opportunities for non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers to learn the language and improve their communication skills. This can be done through language classes or workshops, either on-site or online.
4. Hire multilingual staff: Train staff in public spaces (such as libraries, museums, or parks) to speak multiple languages, including simplified Chinese characters and traditional Chinese characters. This will help non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers receive information and assistance more effectively.
5. Create bilingual or multilingual materials: Produce materials such as brochures, flyers, or posters in multiple languages, including simplified Chinese characters and traditional Chinese characters. This can help non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers access information about public spaces and events.
6. Use technology to enhance accessibility: Leverage technology to provide real-time translations or audio descriptions of public space amenities and services. For example, using augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) to create immersive experiences that are accessible to non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers.
7. Design inclusive spaces: Ensure that public spaces are designed with accessibility in mind, including wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio signals for visually impaired individuals. This will help create a more inclusive environment for all users, regardless of their language proficiency.
8. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training to staff and volunteers on cultural sensitivity and diversity
