The impact of disability status on the lives of recent widows can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional Distress: Losing a spouse is already emotionally challenging, but for individuals with disabilities, the loss can be particularly difficult due to the added complexity of managing their disability. They may face additional stress and grief related to the loss of their caregiver, which can exacerbate existing emotional challenges.
