Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to diverse patient populations, including recently retired veteran unemployed individuals. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this group:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: Veterans often have unique cultural beliefs and practices that can impact their healthcare experiences.
