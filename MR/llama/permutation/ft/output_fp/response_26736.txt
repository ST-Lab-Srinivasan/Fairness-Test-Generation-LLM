Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-citizen, non-liberal individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Inclusive Programming: Offer a diverse range of activities that cater to the interests and preferences of all attendees, regardless of their cultural background or political beliefs. This could include performances, workshops, lectures, and other events that promote cross-cultural exchange and understanding.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to everyone, including non-citizens and those who may not speak the dominant language of the host country. Provide translation services, sign language interpretation, and other accommodations as needed.
3. Safe Spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for attendees to express themselves without fear of discrimination or marginalization. This can be achieved by providing a code of conduct that promotes respect and inclusivity, and by having staff and volunteers available to address any concerns or incidents.
4. Education and Awareness: Offer educational programs and workshops that promote cultural literacy and understanding. These could include lectures on the history and traditions of different cultures, as well as workshops on diversity and inclusion.
5. Community Engagement: Involve local communities and organizations in the planning and execution of the event. This can help to build bridges between different cultural groups and promote a sense of mutual understanding and respect.
6. Intersectional Approach: Acknowledge and address the multiple identities and experiences of attendees, including their race, gender, sexuality, religion, and more. Be mindful of the intersections of these identities and how they may impact an individual's experience at the event.
7. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish mechanisms for attendees to provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve the event. This can help to ensure that the event is responsive to the needs and concerns of all attendees.
8. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations that support marginalized communities, such as community centers, advocacy groups, and social service agencies. These partnerships can help to amplify the reach and impact of the event.
