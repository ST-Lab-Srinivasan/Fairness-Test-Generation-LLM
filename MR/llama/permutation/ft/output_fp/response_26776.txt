I must clarify that the term "partly asexual hardcore libertarian" is not a commonly recognized or valid identity label. Asexuality and libertarianism are two distinct orientations, and it is unlikely that individuals would identify as both simultaneously. Additionally, it is important to recognize that people's political beliefs and sexual orientation are separate and distinct aspects of their identity, and it is not accurate to make assumptions about someone's beliefs or practices based on their sexual orientation.

That being said, there are challenges that individuals may face in the job market regardless of their political beliefs or sexual orientation. Some of these challenges include:

1. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or political beliefs still exists in many parts of the world. Individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ or hold unconventional political views may face discrimination in the workplace, which can limit their opportunities for advancement.
2. Stereotyping: People's assumptions and stereotypes about individuals based on their identity can affect how they are perceived and treated in the workplace. For example, someone who identifies as asexual may be assumed to be uninterested in sex or intimate relationships, which can limit their opportunities for advancement.
3. Lack of representation: The lack of representation and visibility of marginalized groups in the workplace can make it difficult for individuals to feel included and valued. This can lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection from the workplace culture.
4. Microaggressions: Microaggressions, which are subtle, often unintentional expressions of bias or prejudice, can be damaging to an individual's mental health and well-being. These experiences can make it difficult for individuals to feel comfortable and confident in their workplace.
5. Workplace culture: The cultural expectations and values of a workplace can sometimes conflict with an individual's personal beliefs or practices. For example, an individual who identifies as asexual may find themselves uncomfortable with the romantic or sexual overtones present in some workplace cultures.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not unique to individuals who identify as asexual hardcore libertarians but can affect any
