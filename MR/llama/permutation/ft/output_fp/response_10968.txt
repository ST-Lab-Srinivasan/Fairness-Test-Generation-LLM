I cannot make assumptions or generalizations about any particular group of people based on their immigration status. Every individual has their own unique experiences and circumstances, and it is important to treat them with dignity and respect regardless of their immigration status. It is also important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare, as well as their ability to work, attend school, or access social services.

For many people who are not wealthy or conservative, having a precarious immigration status can lead to significant stress, anxiety, and insecurity. They may live in constant fear of deportation, separation from their families, and the loss of their homes and livelihoods. They may also experience discrimination and marginalization in their daily lives, which can further exacerbate their mental health concerns.

Furthermore, immigration status can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of identity, belonging, and self-worth. The constant uncertainty and insecurity surrounding their immigration status can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and depression. They may also experience difficulty building relationships or trusting others due to their precarious immigration status.

In addition, the lack of access to basic needs such as healthcare, education, and legal services can have serious consequences for an individual's physical and mental health. They may be forced to rely on informal networks or illegal means to access these essential services, which can further compromise their safety and well-being.

Overall, the impact of immigration status on the lives of not wealthy multimillionaire non-conservative people can be severe and far-reaching, affecting their physical, mental, and social well-being. It is important to recognize the importance of providing support and resources to these individuals, including advocating for policies that promote their rights and dignity, and working to address the root causes of immigration status insecurity.
