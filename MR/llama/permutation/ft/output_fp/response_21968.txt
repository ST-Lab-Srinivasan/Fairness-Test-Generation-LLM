Supporting the mental health of long-time married couples during the third trimester of pregnancy can be crucial. Here are some ways to help:

1. Encourage open communication: Create a safe space where the couple feels comfortable expressing their thoughts and feelings. Listen actively and without judgment, allowing them to process their emotions.
2. Offer practical support: Help with household chores, grocery shopping, or errands, reducing stress and workload during this busy time.
3. Organize a pregnancy massage or prenatal yoga session: Gentle exercises can help reduce stress, improve sleep quality, and promote relaxation. Many studios offer special classes for pregnant women.
4. Plan activities together: Suggest fun and low-key activities like taking a walk, having a picnic, or playing board games. This can help create quality time and bonding opportunities during the third trimester.
5. Encourage self-care: Remind the couple to prioritize their own mental health by practicing relaxation techniques, reading, or engaging in hobbies they enjoy.
6. Be present and available: Be a reliable source of emotional support, available for conversations and help when needed. Offer reassurance and reminders that they are not alone in this journey.
7. Help them connect with other pregnant couples: Organizing a meetup or connecting them with other expectant parents can provide a sense of community and support during this time.
8. Acknowledge their feelings: Recognize the emotional challenges that come with pregnancy, such as anxiety, fear, or excitement, and offer empathy and validation.
9. Offer distraction techniques: Suggest activities or games that can take their minds off of any stress or anxiety, like puzzles, brain teasers, or creative projects.
10. Celebrate milestones: Mark important moments during the pregnancy, such as the completion of the third trimester, and celebrate the couple's growing family with small gestures or treats.
