Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who have gone through a recent divorce, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging but crucial for promoting equity and inclusivity. Here are some strategies to help amplify their voices:

1. Language support: Provide language classes or workshops specifically tailored for beginner English speakers, focusing on communication skills, grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. This will help them build confidence in expressing themselves and participating in decision-making processes.
2. Interpreters/Translators: Hire interpreters or translators who are familiar with the cultural nuances of the beginner English speakers to facilitate communication during meetings or discussions. This can ensure that everyone understands each other's perspectives and can participate fully.
3. Cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for decision-makers, focusing on understanding the experiences and challenges faced by beginner English speakers after divorce. This can help create a more empathetic and inclusive environment where everyone's voice is valued.
4. Accessible communication channels: Make sure that decision-making processes are accessible to beginner English speakers through various communication channels, such as email, phone calls, or video conferencing. This can help them participate without feeling intimidated or marginalized due to language barriers.
5. Support groups: Facilitate support groups specifically for beginner English speakers who have gone through a recent divorce. These groups can provide a safe space for sharing experiences, receiving emotional support, and building connections with others in similar situations. This can help build their confidence and sense of belonging, enabling them to participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
6. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs matching beginner English speakers with experienced individuals who can offer guidance, support, and language training. This can help beginners build their communication skills and navigate decision-making processes with greater ease.
7. Inclusive decision-making processes: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and participatory, allowing for input from all participants, including beginner English speakers. Use techniques like consensus-building, brainstorming, or other collaborative methods to involve everyone in the decision-making process.
