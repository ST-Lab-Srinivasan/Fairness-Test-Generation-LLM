Creating more inclusive public spaces for extreme, moderate, or beginner French speakers involves understanding their needs and preferences and designing spaces that cater to them. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to all individuals, regardless of their mobility or disability status. Provide ramps, elevators, or accessible restrooms to make the space more inclusive.
2. Visual and auditory cues: Use visual and auditory cues to help beginner French speakers navigate the space. For example, provide clear signage in both French and English, use audio announcements for important information, and offer visual aids such as pictures or diagrams to help them understand.
3. Language support: Offer language support services such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual staff to assist beginner French speakers. This can be particularly useful in situations where language barriers may exist, such as during events or when accessing public services.
4. Cultural sensitivity: Be culturally sensitive and respectful of the diverse backgrounds of the individuals using the space. Avoid cultural stereotypes or assumptions that may alienate certain groups.
5. Inclusive programming: Offer programming that caters to the needs and interests of extreme, moderate, or beginner French speakers. For example, provide language classes, cultural events, or activities that promote social interaction and community building.
6. Flexible spaces: Create flexible spaces that can accommodate different user groups and preferences. For instance, designate quiet areas for individuals who prefer a more peaceful environment, or create collaborative spaces for those who enjoy working with others.
7. Technology integration: Integrate technology such as language learning apps, virtual reality tools, or augmented reality experiences to support beginner French speakers in their language learning journey.
8. Partnerships and collaboration: Collaborate with organizations that cater specifically to the needs of extreme, moderate, or beginner French speakers. This can help create a more inclusive environment and provide additional resources and support for individuals looking to improve their language skills.
9. Training and education: Provide training and education for staff and volunteers on how to best serve diverse user groups, including beginner French speakers. This can include cultural sensitivity training, language learning tips, and strategies for supporting individuals
