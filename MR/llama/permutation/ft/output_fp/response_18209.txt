Supporting the civic engagement of temporary visa holder mixed Hispanic heritage people requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that organizations and individuals can use to support these individuals:

1. Provide language access: Many temporary visa holders may face barriers in accessing information and services due to language barriers. Providing language access services, such as interpreters or translated materials, can help ensure that they have equal access to civic engagement opportunities.
2. Offer cultural competency training: Organizations can provide cultural competency training for staff and volunteers to better understand the experiences and challenges faced by mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. This can help improve interactions and communication with these individuals.
3. Create inclusive spaces: Organizations should strive to create inclusive spaces that welcome and value the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve providing safe and comfortable environments for dialogue and action.
4. Connect with trusted sources: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to information and resources due to their immigration status. Organizations can connect them with trusted sources of information, such as community-based organizations or legal clinics, to provide them with accurate and reliable information.
5. Advocate for policy change: Organizations can advocate for policies that support the full civic engagement of mixed Hispanic heritage individuals, such as permanent residency or citizenship pathways. This can involve building coalitions with other organizations and advocating for policy changes at the local, state, or federal levels.
6. Provide voter registration drives: Organizations can conduct voter registration drives specifically targeting mixed Hispanic heritage individuals to ensure they are registered to vote and have access to the polls.
7. Offer civic education: Organizations can provide civic education programs that are tailored to the needs and experiences of mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. This can involve teaching them about their rights and responsibilities as citizens, as well as providing information on how to participate in the democratic process.
8. Create digital platforms: Organizations can create digital platforms, such as social media campaigns or online forums, that provide opportunities for mixed Hispanic heritage individuals to engage in civic activities,
