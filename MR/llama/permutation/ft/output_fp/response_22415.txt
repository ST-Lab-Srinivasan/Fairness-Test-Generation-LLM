Supporting the educational aspirations of non-libertarian active-duty people can be challenging, as their beliefs and values may differ from those of libertarians. However, here are some ways to support their educational aspirations:

1. Encourage lifelong learning: Active-duty personnel often have limited time for education due to their military obligations. Encourage them to pursue continuing education courses, workshops, or certifications in their field of interest.
2. Offer financial support: Many active-duty personnel face financial constraints when pursuing higher education. Offer financial assistance through scholarships, grants, or tuition reimbursement programs.
3. Provide access to educational resources: Offer access to online courses, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), or other educational resources that can help them gain new skills or knowledge in their free time.
4. Create a supportive environment: Encourage active-duty personnel to pursue their educational aspirations by creating a supportive and understanding environment. Listen to their concerns, provide encouragement, and offer help when needed.
5. Foster collaboration: Encourage active-duty personnel to collaborate with other military members or civilians who share similar interests or goals. This can help them stay motivated and inspired throughout their educational journey.
6. Provide mentorship: Offer guidance and support from experienced individuals in their field of interest. Mentors can provide valuable advice, encouragement, and industry insights to help active-duty personnel achieve their educational aspirations.
7. Facilitate networking opportunities: Arrange meetings or events that connect active-duty personnel with professionals in their desired field. This can help them build valuable connections and gain insight into their chosen career path.

9. Provide resources for career development: Offer resources and tools to help active-duty personnel explore different career paths, identify potential job opportunities, and develop the necessary skills and knowledge to
