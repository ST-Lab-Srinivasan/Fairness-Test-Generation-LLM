Supporting the social inclusion of non-native Arabic speakers, particularly those from a Christian background, can be challenging in predominantly Muslim societies. Here are some ways to promote their integration and inclusion:

1. Language classes: Offer language classes specifically designed for beginners, tailored to their needs and levels of proficiency. This will help them improve their Arabic skills and build confidence in using the language.
2. Cultural orientation: Provide cultural orientation programs that teach about Islamic customs, traditions, and values. This will help them understand the local culture better and avoid unintentional offenses or misunderstandings.
3. Social events: Organize social events, such as potlucks, picnics, or game nights, where they can interact with other Muslims in a relaxed setting. These events can help build relationships and foster a sense of belonging.
4. Mentorship programs: Pair them with experienced Muslims who can act as mentors, providing guidance on how to navigate local customs and practices. This will help them feel more comfortable and confident in their new environment.
