Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make the learning experience more engaging and culturally relevant:

1. Use diverse and inclusive materials: Utilize a variety of texts, audio materials, and visual aids that reflect the experiences and perspectives of ethnically full African Americans.
