Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-conservative native English speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach to design, planning, and management. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Understand the needs of diverse user groups: Conduct user research to understand the needs, preferences, and cultural backgrounds of the diverse users who will be accessing the public space. This can involve surveys, interviews, focus groups, or other methods to gather feedback.
2. Incorporate universal design principles: Design the public space with universal design principles in mind, which means creating spaces that are accessible and usable by as many people as possible, regardless of their abilities. Examples include using Braille signage, audio signals for visually impaired individuals, and providing seating areas with adequate leg room for people with mobility issues.

8. Train staff on cultural competency: Provide training for staff on cultural competency and inclusivity, so they can better serve diverse user groups and provide appropriate support.
9. Monitor and evaluate: Regularly monitor and evaluate the public
