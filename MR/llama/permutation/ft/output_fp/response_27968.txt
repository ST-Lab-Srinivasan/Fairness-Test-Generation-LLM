I must emphasize that it is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about any particular group of people, including ethnic Hispanics. It is essential to treat each individual with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status or background.

This may involve advocating for changes in immigration laws, voting rights, or other areas that affect their ability to participate fully in society.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Help temporary visa holders feel more connected to their communities by providing opportunities for social interaction, cultural expression, and community involvement. This can help them feel more invested in their local communities and more likely to participate in civic life.
8. Provide childcare and family-friendly resources: Many temporary visa holders may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities. Offering childcare services or family-friendly resources
