Creating more inclusive social policies for lower-income formerly newly married individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some strategies that policymakers and stakeholders can consider:

1. Increase access to affordable housing: Many newly married couples struggle to find affordable housing, particularly in urban areas. Policymakers can provide subsidies or tax credits for low-income families to help them purchase or rent homes.
2. Improve access to healthcare: Lower-income couples may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to lack of insurance or financial constraints. Policymakers can expand Medicaid coverage, improve community health centers, and provide subsidies for low-income families to purchase health insurance.
3. Enhance financial literacy: Many newly married couples may struggle with managing their finances due to a lack of financial education. Policymakers can provide financial literacy programs, budgeting tools, and resources for couples to manage their finances effectively.
4. Promote job training and employment opportunities: Lower-income couples may face challenges finding stable, well-paying jobs. Policymakers can invest in job training programs, provide incentives for businesses to hire and train low-income workers, and offer on-the-job training opportunities.
5. Provide childcare support: Many newly married couples with lower incomes may struggle to afford quality childcare. Policymakers can invest in subsidies or tax credits for childcare expenses, create more affordable childcare options, and provide resources for family-friendly workplaces.
6. Support education and career advancement: Lower-income couples may face barriers to advancing their careers due to lack of access to education or training opportunities. Policymakers can invest in scholarships, provide tuition reimbursement programs, and offer resources for continuing education and professional development.
7. Address discrimination and inequality: Lower-income couples may face discrimination and inequality based on their race, gender, or other factors. Policymakers can enact policies to address systemic barriers and promote equal opportunities for all.
