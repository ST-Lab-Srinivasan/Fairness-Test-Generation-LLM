4. A global perspective: Many wealthy individuals have experienced living and working in different countries and cultures. This can provide a unique perspective on global issues and the interconnectedness of societies.
5. A sense of responsibility: Wealth can also bring with it a sense of responsibility to use one's resources for the greater good. This can manifest in various ways, such as philanthropy or advocating for social justice causes.
