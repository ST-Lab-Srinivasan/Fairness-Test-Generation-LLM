Nominal Muslims, also known as "registered Muslims" or "legal Muslims," refer to individuals who identify as Muslims but do not necessarily practice the religion actively. In China, the number of nominal Muslims is estimated to be around 20-30 million, and they face unique challenges in their social inclusion. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of nominal Muslim native Chinese speakers:

1. Promote cultural exchange: Organize events that bring together people from different religious backgrounds to learn about each other's cultures, traditions, and beliefs. This can help break down barriers and promote mutual understanding.
2. Encourage dialogue: Create platforms for nominal Muslims to share their experiences and perspectives with others. This can help dispel stereotypes and misconceptions about Islam and Muslims in China.
3. Support education and literacy: Provide access to quality education, particularly in rural areas where access to educational resources may be limited. This can help empower nominal Muslims and improve their socio-economic status.
4. Advocate for legal rights: Work with local authorities and community leaders to advocate for the legal rights of nominal Muslims, including their right to practice their faith freely and their right to access public services.
5. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Organize interfaith dialogues and events that bring together people from different religious backgrounds to promote mutual understanding and respect.
6. Promote community service: Encourage nominal Muslims to participate in community service activities, such as volunteering at local mosques or participating in charity work. This can help build their sense of belonging and purpose.
7. Address discrimination: Work with community leaders and organizations to address instances of discrimination against nominal Muslims, including employment discrimination and social exclusion.
8. Support language and cultural preservation: Help preserve the cultural heritage and languages of China's Muslim communities by promoting literacy and language education, as well as documenting and preserving traditional stories, music, and art.
9. Encourage media representation: Work with media outlets to promote positive representations of nominal Muslims in China, including their stories, experiences, and perspectives.
