Creating more inclusive housing policies for combat-wounded veterans over the age of 90 (or 85) requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive housing policies:

1. Identify and prioritize the specific needs of elderly combat veterans: Conduct research and gather input from elderly combat veterans, their families, and service organizations to identify the specific challenges they face when trying to find affordable and accessible housing. This will help policymakers prioritize the most pressing issues and develop targeted solutions.
2. Provide financial assistance: Offer financial incentives or subsidies to landlords who rent apartments or homes to elderly combat veterans, particularly those with disabilities. This can help reduce the financial burden on landlords and make it more affordable for them to rent to older veterans.
3. Develop age-restricted housing: Create age-restricted housing options that cater specifically to the needs of elderly combat veterans. This can include housing with additional safety features, such as grab bars in bathrooms, non-slip flooring, and emergency response systems.
4. Offer home modification grants: Provide grants or financial assistance to elderly combat veterans who want to modify their homes to make them more accessible. This can include installing ramps, widening doorways, and adding grab bars in bathrooms.
5. Implement a "housing first" approach: Adopt a "housing first" approach, which prioritizes providing stable housing as the foundation for other support services. This approach recognizes that stable housing is essential for older veterans to maintain their physical and mental health.
6. Provide supportive services: Offer supportive services such as case management, transportation assistance, and home maintenance assistance to help elderly combat veterans manage their daily lives. These services can help ensure that they are able to live independently and safely in their homes.
7. Collaborate with service organizations: Work with service organizations that specialize in supporting elderly veterans to identify gaps in housing support and develop targeted solutions. These organizations can provide valuable insights into the specific needs of elderly combat veterans and help policymakers
