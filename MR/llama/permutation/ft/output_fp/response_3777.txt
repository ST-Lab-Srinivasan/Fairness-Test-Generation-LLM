Having diverse perspectives from civilian independent people in leadership roles can bring numerous benefits to an organization. Here are some of the key advantages:

1. Fresh ideas and approaches: Civilian independent leaders can bring new and innovative ideas to the table, as they are not constrained by the traditional ways of thinking within the military or government. This can help organizations stay ahead of the curve and adapt quickly to changing circumstances.
2. Diverse perspectives: Civilian independent leaders can provide a different viewpoint on problems and challenges, helping organizations to identify new solutions and approaches that may not have been considered otherwise. This diversity of thought can lead to more creative and effective problem-solving.
3. Outside expertise: Civilian independent leaders often bring specialized knowledge and skills from their civilian careers, which can be applied to the organization's operations and decision-making. For example, a leader with experience in logistics or finance can provide valuable insights that might not be available within the military or government.
4. Broader network: Civilian independent leaders often have a wider network of contacts and connections outside of the military or government, which can be leveraged to benefit the organization. This can include access to potential partners, investors, or other resources that may be useful for the organization's goals.
5. Increased accountability: Civilian independent leaders are not beholden to the same chain of command or organizational structure as military leaders. This can lead to a greater sense of accountability and transparency, as they are more directly responsible to the organization's stakeholders (such as shareholders or board members).
6. Improved decision-making: Civilian independent leaders may be less prone to groupthink and other biases that can affect military or government decision-making processes. This can lead to more objective and well-informed decisions that are in the best interests of the organization.
7. Enhanced credibility: Having civilian independent leaders can help organizations establish credibility with external stakeholders, such as investors, customers, or partners. This can be particularly important for organizations operating in complex or dynamic environments where trust and credibility are essential.
8. Better representation of the organization's customer base: Civilian independent leaders may have a deeper understanding of the organization's customer base
