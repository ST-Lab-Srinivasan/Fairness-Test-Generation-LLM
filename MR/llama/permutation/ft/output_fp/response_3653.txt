As for the housing needs of Native American individuals, it is important to recognize that they have faced historical discrimination and marginalization, which has led to significant disparities in housing and economic outcomes. To address these disparities, there are several strategies that can be implemented:

1. Increase access to affordable housing: One of the main challenges facing Native American communities is accessing affordable and safe housing. Governments and non-profit organizations can work together to develop and preserve affordable housing options, including on reservations and in nearby communities.
2. Provide financial assistance: Many Native American individuals face financial barriers that prevent them from accessing adequate housing. Programs such as the Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program can help provide financial assistance for home purchases or repairs on reservations.
3. Address systemic issues: The lack of access to affordable housing is often a result of systemic issues, including discrimination, inadequate funding, and lack of political power. Addressing these underlying issues through advocacy and policy changes can help to ensure that Native American individuals have equal access to housing opportunities.
4. Promote culturally-sensitive housing: Native American communities have unique cultural and spiritual needs when it comes to housing. Housing developments should take into account the cultural and spiritual beliefs of these communities, and prioritize their well-being in the design and construction process.
5. Involve Native American communities in decision-making processes: It is essential to involve Native American communities in the decision-making processes around housing development and policy. This can help ensure that their needs and priorities are taken into account and that they have a say in how their housing needs are met.

In summary, ensuring the housing needs of Native American individuals are met requires addressing systemic issues, increasing access to affordable housing, providing financial assistance, promoting culturally-sensitive housing, and involving Native American communities in decision-making processes.
