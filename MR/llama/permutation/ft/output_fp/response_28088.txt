Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner French speakers who are not divorced multiple times requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Identify and address unconscious biases: We all have biases, whether we realize it or not. Be aware of any unconscious biases you may hold and take steps to address them. For example, avoid making assumptions about someone's language proficiency based on their age, gender, or marital status.
