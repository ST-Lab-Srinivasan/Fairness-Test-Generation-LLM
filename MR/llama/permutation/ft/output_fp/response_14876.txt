As a lower middle-income beginner English speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in your country. Here are some potential challenges you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: The legal system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not fluent in the language of the court. As a beginner English speaker, you may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, which can make it difficult to navigate the system effectively.
2. Limited access to information: Depending on where you live, there may be limited resources available to help you understand the legal system and your rights and responsibilities within it. This can make it harder for you to make informed decisions about your legal issues.
3. Affordability: Legal services can be expensive, especially if you are not wealthy. This can make it difficult for you to access legal aid or representation, which can limit your ability to advocate for yourself in legal matters.
4. Lack of trust: If you do not have a positive experience with the legal system in the past, you may be hesitant to seek legal advice or representation. This can make it harder for you to access the help you need and can lead to feelings of mistrust towards the legal system.
5. Limited understanding of legal procedures: The legal system can have complex procedures and rules that are difficult to understand, especially for those who are not familiar with them. This can make it hard for you to navigate the system effectively and to advocate for yourself in legal matters.
6. Difficulty in finding the right lawyer: Finding a lawyer who is knowledgeable about your specific legal issue and who is willing to take on a lower-income client can be challenging. This can make it difficult for you to find the right representation for your legal needs.
7. Limited access to legal aid: Depending on where you live, there may be limited resources available for legal aid organizations that provide free or low-cost legal services to those who cannot afford them. This can limit your ability to access legal help if you are low-income.
8. Difficulty in navigating the court system: The court system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. This can make it difficult for you to navigate the system effectively and to advocate for yourself in legal matters.
