Highlighting the issues faced by native Arabic speakers who are recent immigrants to the US can be done through various data-driven methods. Here are some suggestions:

1. Survey Research: Conduct surveys among recent Arabic immigrants to gather data on their experiences, challenges, and concerns. The survey could cover topics such as language barriers, cultural adaptation, employment discrimination, access to healthcare, and social integration.
2. Social Media Analysis: Analyze social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for conversations related to Arabic immigrant experiences in the US. This can help identify trends, sentiment analysis, and areas of concern.
3. Government Data: Utilize data from government agencies such as the US Census Bureau, Department of Labor, and Department of Education to understand the demographics, employment status, and educational attainment of Arabic immigrants in the US.
4. Academic Research: Review academic literature on the experiences of Arabic immigrants in the US, including studies on language acquisition, cultural adaptation, and socio-economic outcomes. This can provide insights into the broader trends and challenges faced by this population.
5. Case Studies: Conduct case studies of individual Arabic immigrants or small groups to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and challenges. This can help identify specific issues and inform data-driven solutions.
6. Data Visualization: Use data visualization tools to present the data in an engaging and easy-to-understand format, such as interactive maps, charts, and graphs. This can help illustrate the spatial distribution of Arabic immigrants, their socioeconomic status, and other relevant factors.
7. Machine Learning: Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships in the data that may not be immediately apparent. For example, you could train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an Arabic immigrant experiencing discrimination based on their demographic characteristics or employment status.
8. Panel Data: If you have access to longitudinal data, such as the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS), you can use panel data techniques to analyze how individual-level characteristics and experiences change over time. This can help identify trends and trajectories
