Creating more inclusive social policies for blue-collar ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some recommendations:

1. Increase access to affordable housing: Many blue-collar ex-spouses struggle to find affordable housing, particularly in areas with high cost of living. Governments can provide subsidies or tax credits for down payments, create more affordable housing options, and invest in community land trusts or cooperative housing models.
2. Strengthen the social safety net: Ex-spouses often face financial instability, especially during divorce transitions. Governments can enhance unemployment benefits, provide financial assistance for job training and education, and ensure access to affordable healthcare.
3. Improve access to quality childcare: Affordable, high-quality childcare is essential for ex-spouses who want to pursue employment or education opportunities. Governments can invest in subsidized childcare programs, build more childcare facilities, and provide training and resources for childcare providers.
4. Promote economic empowerment: Ex-spouses may lack access to capital, credit, or networking opportunities. Governments can establish microfinance initiatives, provide access to affordable loans, and create mentorship programs that connect ex-spouses with successful professionals in their field.
5. Address systemic barriers: Many blue-collar ex-spouses face discrimination and bias in the workplace or when seeking services like healthcare or legal aid. Governments can enact policies to address these issues, such as anti-discrimination laws, diversity and inclusion training programs, and targeted funding for organizations that support marginalized communities.

Governments can invest in community centers or co-working spaces where ex-spouses can connect with others, access resources and services, and pursue shared interests.
