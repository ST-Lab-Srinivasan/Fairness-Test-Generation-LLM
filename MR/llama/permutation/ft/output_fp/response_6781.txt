As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the diverse needs of different demographic groups. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-recently widowed individuals:

1. Address income inequality: Implement progressive taxation policies to reduce wealth disparities and ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share. This can be achieved by increasing taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, and using the revenue generated to fund social welfare programs that benefit low-income individuals.
2. Invest in affordable housing: Provide subsidies or tax breaks for developers who build affordable housing units, especially in high-cost areas. This can help make housing more accessible and affordable for low-income households.
3. Improve access to education and job training: Provide free or low-cost education and job training programs for individuals who lack the means to pursue higher education or vocational training. This can help them acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market.
4. Strengthen social safety nets: Expand access to social safety nets such as unemployment insurance, food assistance programs, and healthcare services. These programs can provide a critical layer of support for individuals who are struggling to make ends meet.
5. Address discrimination and systemic barriers: Recognize and address the ways in which systemic barriers and discrimination can limit opportunities for marginalized groups. This can involve implementing policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in hiring practices, education, and other areas of life.
6. Support immigrant and refugee communities: Provide resources and support to help immigrant and refugee communities integrate into society and access the services they need. This can include language training, job placement programs, and mental health support.
7. Foster community engagement and participation: Encourage community engagement and participation in policy-making processes by providing opportunities for individuals to share their perspectives and feedback. This can help ensure that policies are more responsive to the needs of diverse communities.
8. Address environmental factors: Consider the impact of environmental factors such as air pollution, water quality, and access to green spaces on
