Creating more inclusive public policies for mentally disabled Native American natural-born US citizens requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Policymaking: Ensure that mental health advocates, service providers, and individuals with lived experiences are included in policymaking processes. This can be done through advisory groups, public consultations, or even by establishing a dedicated mental health policy committee.
2. Cultural Competency: Train policymakers and service providers on the cultural nuances of Native American communities to better understand their unique needs and develop policies that are responsive to their experiences. This includes recognizing the importance of traditional healing practices, ceremonies, and spiritual beliefs in mental health care.
3. Access to Care: Ensure that individuals have access to mental health services that are culturally appropriate and accessible. This can be achieved by investing in rural healthcare infrastructure, providing transportation to appointments, and offering sliding-scale fees based on income.
4. Community-Based Services: Promote community-based services that prioritize traditional healing practices and cultural beliefs. This can include mobile mental health clinics, telehealth services, and culturally-sensitive outpatient programs.
5. Addressing Historical Trauma: Recognize the historical trauma faced by Native American communities and address its ongoing impact on mental health. This can involve developing policies that prioritize healing and reconciliation, such as truth-telling initiatives, cultural revitalization programs, and commemorative events.
6. Collaboration with Tribal Governments: Work closely with tribal governments to develop policies that are responsive to their unique needs and priorities. This can involve consulting with tribal leaders, developing joint policy initiatives, and providing technical assistance to support tribal capacity-building.
7. Addressing Disparities in Mental Health Services: Identify and address disparities in mental health services, including unequal access to care, cultural insensitivity, and stigma. This can involve developing policies that promote culturally competent care, reducing barriers to service access, and promoting public awareness campaigns that challenge stigmatizing attitudes.
