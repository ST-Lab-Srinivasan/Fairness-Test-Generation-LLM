Promoting the accessibility of public services for Nigerian civilian individuals is crucial for ensuring that everyone has equal access to these services, regardless of their background or location. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Inclusive Design: Design public services with inclusivity in mind. This includes making sure that websites and apps are accessible on different devices and browsers, providing audio and visual aids for people with disabilities, and using clear and simple language.
2. Accessible Infrastructure: Ensure that public infrastructure such as transportation, parks, and buildings are accessible to people of all abilities. This can be achieved by installing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms, and ensuring that walkways are wide enough for wheelchairs.
3. Education and Awareness: Educate the public on the importance of accessibility and how it can benefit everyone. Use various media channels to create awareness campaigns, such as social media, radio, and television ads, and organize workshops and seminars to promote accessibility.
4. Collaboration with Disability Organizations: Work closely with disability organizations to understand their needs and concerns, and involve them in the decision-making process when designing or implementing public services. This can help ensure that the services are tailored to meet the specific needs of people with disabilities.
5. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote accessibility, such as making it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities and providing incentives for businesses to make their premises accessible.
6. Accessible Technology: Encourage the use of accessible technology, such as mobile apps and websites that are designed to be used by people with disabilities. This can help bridge the gap between people with disabilities and those without, and provide equal access to information and services.
7. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach programs to promote accessibility and educate the public on the benefits of accessible services. This can be achieved through door-to-door campaigns, street exhibitions, and community events.
8. Volunteer Programs: Establish volunteer programs that provide assistance to people with disabilities in accessing public services. This can include providing transportation, accompaniment, and support during the service delivery process.
