Active-duty ethnically full Hispanic individuals face unique challenges and stressors in their military service. Here are some support systems that can be important for them:

1. Military Cultural Support Groups: Joining cultural support groups specifically for Hispanic or Latino service members can provide a sense of community and belonging, helping to counteract the feelings of isolation that may arise from being part of a minority group in the military. These groups can offer support, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
2. Unit Support: Building strong relationships with fellow unit members can help ethnically full Hispanic service members feel more connected and supported within their units. Having colleagues who understand and appreciate their cultural background can create a more positive military experience.
3. Family Support: Ethnically full Hispanic service members often rely on their families for emotional support, particularly during deployments or when facing challenges related to their cultural identity. Building strong family relationships and maintaining open communication can help them cope with the stresses of military life.
4. Peer Mentorship: Finding peers who share similar cultural experiences and backgrounds can provide ethnically full Hispanic service members with valuable guidance, support, and a sense of belonging. These mentors can offer advice on navigating military culture and overcoming challenges related to their identity.
5. Military Chaplaincy Services: Military chaplains can provide spiritual support and guidance to ethnically full Hispanic service members, helping them navigate the intersection of their cultural identity and their religious beliefs. They can also offer counseling services to help individuals cope with stressors related to their military service.
6. Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs): EAPs offer confidential support services for service members dealing with a range of issues, including mental health concerns, relationship problems, and financial stressors. Ethnically full Hispanic service members can benefit from these programs, which often provide access to counseling, financial planning, and other resources.
7. Military Spouse and Family Groups: For ethnically full Hispanic service members who are married or have family members in the military, joining support groups specifically for military spouses and families can provide a sense of community and belonging.
