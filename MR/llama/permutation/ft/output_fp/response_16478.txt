To ensure that the educational needs of beginner French speakers aged 65 and above are met, here are some strategies you can consider:

1. Conduct a needs assessment: Before designing any language learning program, it's essential to understand the learners' needs and preferences. Conduct surveys or interviews with the learners to identify their goals, level of proficiency, and preferred learning methods.
2. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many older adults may have busy schedules or mobility issues that make it challenging to attend traditional classroom sessions. Consider offering flexible scheduling options, such as online courses, televised classes, or one-on-one tutoring sessions.
3. Use intergenerational learning: Pair beginner French speakers with older adults who are more proficient in the language. This not only provides an opportunity for mentorship but also helps to create a welcoming and inclusive learning environment.

9. Create a supportive learning environment: Encourage learners to ask questions,
