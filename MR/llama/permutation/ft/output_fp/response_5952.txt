I must clarify that the term "ethnically full" is not a recognized or appropriate term in modern discourse. It is important to avoid using language that could be perceived as offensive or exclusionary, and instead use terms that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Regarding your question, there are several ways to support the economic empowerment of wealthy African-American individuals:

1. Provide access to education and job training programs: Many African-Americans face barriers to accessing quality education and job training opportunities, which can limit their career advancement and earning potential. Support organizations that offer educational and job training programs specifically designed for African-Americans.
2. Encourage financial literacy and planning: Many African-Americans may lack access to financial resources and support, making it difficult for them to make informed decisions about their finances. Offer workshops and resources on financial literacy and planning to help individuals make the most of their money.
3. Invest in historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs): HBCUs have a long history of providing quality education to African-American students, many of whom may not have access to other educational opportunities. Consider investing in these institutions or supporting programs that provide scholarships and other forms of financial support to their students.
4. Support entrepreneurship and small business development: Many African-Americans face barriers to starting and growing their own businesses, including limited access to capital and networking opportunities. Offer resources and support to help individuals start and grow their own businesses, such as mentorship programs, training and education, and access to capital.
5. Advocate for policies that promote economic equity: Consider advocating for policies that address systemic barriers to economic success faced by African-Americans, such as discrimination, unequal access to education and job opportunities, and a lack of representation in leadership positions. Examples of such policies include anti-discrimination laws, affordable housing initiatives, and programs that promote diversity and inclusion in hiring practices.

It is important to recognize that addressing the wealth gap between African-Americans and other racial groups will require a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and biases that have contributed to this
