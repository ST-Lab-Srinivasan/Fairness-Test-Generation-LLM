I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about individuals based on their immigration status. Everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's worth, value, or contributions to society.

It is also important to recognize that immigration status can have significant impacts on an individual's life, including their ability to access certain benefits and services, their sense of safety and security, and their overall well-being. However, it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about individuals based on their immigration status.

Instead, it is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It is also important to work towards creating a society that is inclusive and supportive of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
