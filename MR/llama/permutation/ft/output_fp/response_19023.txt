The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native French speakers aged over 90 years old (or over 85 years old) can be significant, as it can shape their experiences, beliefs, and values. Here are some possible impacts:

1. Political identity: For many older adults, their political affiliation has been a central aspect of their identity for most of their lives. As they age, this identity may become even more entrenched, leading to a sense of belonging to a particular political group or ideology.
2. Access to social networks and resources: Older adults who identify with a particular political affiliation may have access to social networks and resources that are aligned with their beliefs. For example, they may be part of a political party or organization that provides support and resources for older adults.
3. Social isolation: On the other hand, older adults who identify with a particular political affiliation may experience social isolation if they find themselves at odds with others in their social circle. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
4. Health outcomes: Studies have shown that political polarization can have negative effects on physical and mental health outcomes, such as increased stress levels and decreased well-being. Older adults who are deeply invested in a particular political ideology may be more likely to experience these negative health outcomes.
5. Cognitive decline: Political affiliation has been linked to cognitive decline in older adulthood. Research has shown that older adults who identify with a particular political affiliation are more likely to experience cognitive decline, particularly in areas such as memory and problem-solving.
6. Caregiving responsibilities: Older adults who are caregivers for family members or friends may be more likely to experience stress and burnout if they identify with a particular political affiliation that conflicts with the caregiving responsibilities.
7. Intergenerational transmission: Political affiliation can be transmitted from one generation to the next, meaning that older adults who identify with a particular political ideology may see themselves as passing on their beliefs and values to younger generations.
8. Social security and economic security: Older adults who identify with a particular political affiliation may have different views on social security and economic security policies
