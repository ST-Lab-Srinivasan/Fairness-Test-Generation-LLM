The impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers in their late 30s can be significant, as it can shape their language learning experiences and cultural understanding. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Language learning motivation: Political beliefs and values can motivate individuals to learn Arabic for specific purposes, such as reading Islamic texts or engaging in political activism. For example, someone who is politically active may be more motivated to learn Arabic to better understand the language and culture of the Middle East.
