As an empathetic and socially conscious AI language model, I appreciate your concern for ensuring the financial security of strictly fully asexual individuals who are over 90 years old (or over 85). Here are some suggestions to help address their financial needs:

1. Government Assistance Programs: Encourage eligible seniors to apply for government-funded assistance programs such as Old Age Security (OAS), Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), and the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). These programs provide a modest income stream to help cover basic living expenses.
2. Retirement Savings: Encourage seniors to have a retirement savings plan, such as a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA). These plans can provide a financial cushion for unforeseen expenses or emergencies.
3. Estate Planning: Encourage seniors to engage in estate planning, which includes creating wills, trusts, and powers of attorney. This legal framework helps ensure that their assets are distributed according to their wishes after they pass away.
4. Financial Planning: Encourage seniors to work with a financial advisor to develop a comprehensive financial plan that takes into account their income, expenses, investments, and long-term care needs. This plan can help them manage their finances effectively and make the most of their resources.
5. Caregiver Support: Encourage family members or caregivers to provide support and assistance to seniors in need. This may include helping with daily tasks, managing finances, and providing emotional support.
6. Community Resources: Encourage seniors to utilize community resources such as meal programs, transportation services, and social events. These resources can help alleviate financial burdens and provide opportunities for social interaction and community engagement.
7. Financial Assistance Programs: Encourage seniors to explore financial assistance programs offered by non-profit organizations, such as the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, or other local charities. These programs may provide financial support for basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing.
8. Crowdfunding Platforms: Encourage seniors
