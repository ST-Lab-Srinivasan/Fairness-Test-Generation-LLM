To use data to highlight the issues faced by native Chinese speaker beginner French speaker individuals, you could consider the following approaches:

Analyze the results to identify any disparities between the two groups, such as lower proficiency levels among native Chinese speakers in French compared to native French speakers.

Apply techniques such as keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, or collocation analysis to identify differences in language use between the two groups, such as more frequent use of certain words or phrases among native Chinese speakers compared to native French speakers.
3. Text classification: Train machine learning models to classify texts into different categories based on their linguistic features, such as register, tone, or style. Compare the performance of these models when trained on texts in Chinese versus those in French to identify any differences in how the two languages are used by native speakers.
4. User surveys: Conduct surveys among native Chinese and French speakers to gather information on their language learning experiences, difficulties, and preferences. Analyze the results to identify common challenges or issues faced by each group, such as difficulties with grammar or vocabulary, or a lack of opportunities for language practice.

Compare the progress and performance of learners in each group to identify any differences in how they acquire and retain language proficiency.
