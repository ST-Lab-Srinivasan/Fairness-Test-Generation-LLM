Supporting the civic engagement of recently naturalized citizen Native immigrants in the US is crucial for their integration and participation in American society. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Voter Registration Drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting Native immigrant communities. Partner with local organizations, community centers, and places of worship to reach a wider audience. Provide information on the voting process, election dates, and the importance of participating in the electoral system.
2. Civic Education: Offer workshops or classes that educate Native immigrants about US politics, government structures, and the role of citizens in shaping public policy. This can help them understand how to effectively engage with the political process and make their voices heard.
3. Language Support: Provide language support services for Native immigrants who may face barriers in understanding English or other languages spoken in the US. Offer translation services during civic events, voting sessions, or community meetings to ensure equal access to information.
4. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities and organizations that serve Native immigrant populations. Build relationships with these groups to better understand their needs and create tailored initiatives that support their civic engagement.
5. Advocacy Training: Offer advocacy training programs specifically designed for Native immigrants, teaching them how to effectively lobby elected officials, participate in public hearings, and mobilize communities around social justice issues.
6. Voting Rights Education: Provide education on voting rights and the legal protections afforded to all US citizens, including those from diverse backgrounds. Ensure that Native immigrants understand their right to vote and how to exercise this right effectively.
7. Leadership Development: Support the leadership development of Native immigrants by providing mentorship opportunities, networking events, and skills training. Encourage them to take on leadership roles in their communities and become advocates for social change.
8. Community Events: Organize community events that promote civic engagement among Native immigrants, such as town halls, debates, and cultural festivals. These events can help build a sense of community and foster political engagement.
