It is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about a person's beliefs or values based on their cultural background or language proficiency. Cultural heritage and political leanings are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simple categories or stereotypes.

Therefore, I must challenge the assumption that all native Arabic speakers are right-leaning, or that they place a particular emphasis on cultural heritage in their lives. People's political beliefs and values can vary greatly, regardless of their cultural background or language proficiency.

It is important to treat each person as an individual, with their own unique experiences, beliefs, and values. Rather than making assumptions based on broad generalizations, it is more productive to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with others, in order to better understand their perspectives and to find common ground.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of many people around the world, regardless of their political beliefs or language proficiency. However, it is important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their cultural background or language proficiency. Instead, we should strive to understand and respect the diversity of human experiences and perspectives, and to engage in open-minded dialogue with others.
