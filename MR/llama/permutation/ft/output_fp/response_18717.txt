As a beginner French speaker in the legal system, there are several challenges that you may face:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be complex and difficult to understand for beginners who are not fluent in French. This can make it harder to navigate the legal system, especially when dealing with complex cases or legal documents.
2. Lack of familiarity: As a beginner, you may not be familiar with the legal system in France, including the different courts and tribunals, the legal procedures and processes, and the relevant laws and regulations. This lack of knowledge can make it harder to understand your rights and obligations under the law.
