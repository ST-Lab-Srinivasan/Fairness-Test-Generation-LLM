As an AI language model, I do not have access to specific data or statistics on the challenges faced by advanced Arabic speakers over the age of 90 in the healthcare system. However, I can provide some general insights based on available information and studies.

Older adults who are non-native speakers of Arabic may face several challenges when accessing healthcare services in countries where Arabic is the dominant language. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Older adults who do not speak Arabic fluently may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers, understanding medical instructions, and filling out medical forms. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, or delayed diagnoses, which can negatively impact their health outcomes.
2. Cultural differences: Older adults from different cultural backgrounds may have different beliefs, values, and practices related to healthcare. For example, they may be more likely to seek traditional or alternative medicine rather than Western-style medical care. Healthcare providers may need to be aware of these cultural differences and adapt their communication styles accordingly.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: Older adults who are advanced Arabic speakers may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to factors such as limited mobility, transportation issues, or lack of access to healthcare facilities in their area.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, older adults from diverse backgrounds may experience discrimination or bias in the healthcare system. This can result from a lack of cultural competence among healthcare providers or unconscious biases that affect decision-making.
5. Difficulty navigating complex healthcare systems: Older adults who are advanced Arabic speakers may find it challenging to navigate complex healthcare systems, particularly if they are not familiar with the local healthcare infrastructure. This can lead to delays or misunderstandings in receiving necessary medical care.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on the location and availability of specialists, older adults who are advanced Arabic speakers may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiology, oncology, or neurology.
7. Stigma associated with aging: Older adults may face stigma and ageism
