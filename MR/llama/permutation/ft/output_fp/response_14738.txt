Creating more inclusive community events for native Spanish speaker lower-class people requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the challenges that may prevent lower-class individuals from participating in community events, such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited access to information. Address these barriers by providing solutions, such as transportation subsidies, on-site childcare, or targeted marketing efforts.
2. Involve diverse leadership: Ensure that the planning committee for the community event includes individuals from different backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses. This can help ensure that the event is inclusive and representative of the community's diversity.
3. Provide language support: Offer interpretation and translation services during the event to accommodate native Spanish speakers who may not be fluent in the dominant language of the community.
4. Focus on accessibility: Ensure that the venue and programming are accessible to people with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
5. Offer affordable food options: Provide affordable food options during the event, such as traditional dishes from the community or refreshments that are within budget constraints.
6. Create a welcoming environment: Train volunteers and staff to be welcoming and inclusive of all participants, including native Spanish speakers. Encourage participants to express themselves in their native language, and provide cultural sensitive activities and programming.
7. Address cultural differences: Be sensitive to cultural differences and traditions when planning the event. For example, if the community has a strong indigenous culture, consider incorporating traditional music, dance, or art into the event.
8. Promote the event through multiple channels: Utilize various communication channels to promote the event, such as social media, flyers in multiple languages, and local newspapers.
9. Encourage community participation: Involve the community in the planning and execution of the event, such as through volunteer opportunities or cultural exhibitions. This can help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity.
10. Evaluate and improve: After the event, evaluate its success in terms of inclusion and accessibility. Identify areas for improvement and make changes for future
