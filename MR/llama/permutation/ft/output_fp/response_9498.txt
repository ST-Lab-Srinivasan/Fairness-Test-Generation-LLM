Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of Native American natural-born US citizens who lean towards the political left. Here are some ways mentorship can impact their growth and development:

1. Cultural identity and pride: Mentors can help mentees connect with their cultural heritage and find pride in their Native American identity, which can shape their political views and values.
2. Historical context: Mentors can provide insight into the historical experiences of Native Americans, such as colonization, forced assimilation, and systemic oppression. This understanding can inform mentees' political beliefs and actions.
3. Community engagement: Mentors can encourage mentees to get involved in their communities and participate in activities that promote social justice and advocacy for Native American rights.
4. Personal development: Mentors can help mentees develop skills such as leadership, critical thinking, and problem-solving, which are essential for effective political engagement.
5. Network building: Mentors can introduce mentees to their professional and personal networks, providing opportunities for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and strategic alliances.
6. Role modeling: Mentors can serve as role models, demonstrating how to navigate complex political landscapes while staying true to one's values and beliefs.
7. Political education: Mentors can provide guidance on political issues affecting Native American communities, such as tribal sovereignty, cultural preservation, and environmental justice.
8. Advocacy skills: Mentors can teach mentees how to effectively advocate for Native American rights and interests within the broader political landscape.
9. Personal growth: Mentorship can foster personal growth and self-awareness, which are critical components of effective political engagement.
10. Empowerment: Mentors can empower mentees to take an active role in shaping their communities' political futures, instilling a sense of agency and responsibility.
