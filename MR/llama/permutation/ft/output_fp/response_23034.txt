Creating more inclusive cultural events for culturally Hindu permanent resident individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Understand and respect cultural differences: It's essential to understand that cultural practices and beliefs vary greatly among individuals from different countries of origin. Be open-minded, respectful, and willing to learn about the customs and traditions of your guests.
2. Involve diverse communities in planning and execution: Engage with local Hindu communities, including those from different countries of origin, to plan and execute cultural events. This will help ensure that the event is inclusive and representative of the diversity of Hindu cultures.
3. Provide translation services: Offer translation services during the event, especially for those who may not speak the dominant language in the host country. This can include providing translation headsets or using visual aids to help communicate with non-English speakers.
4. Incorporate diverse musical and dance performances: Include performances from different Hindu communities, showcasing their unique styles and traditions. This can help create a rich and inclusive cultural experience.
5. Serve diverse food options: Offer a variety of traditional Hindu dishes from different regions and countries, including vegetarian and vegan options. This will help cater to the dietary preferences of attendees from diverse backgrounds.
6. Create an inclusive atmosphere: Ensure that the event space is accessible and comfortable for all attendees. This can include providing wheelchair accessibility, gender-neutral bathrooms, and comfortable seating options.
7. Provide education and awareness: Offer educational materials or workshops during the event to help attendees learn about different Hindu cultural practices and traditions. This can help create a more informed and respectful audience.
8. Engage with local communities: Reach out to local Hindu communities, temples, and organizations to collaborate on the event. This can help build relationships and ensure that the event is culturally sensitive and appropriate.
9. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be aware of cultural sensitivities and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or appropriating Hindu cultural practices without proper understanding or permission.
