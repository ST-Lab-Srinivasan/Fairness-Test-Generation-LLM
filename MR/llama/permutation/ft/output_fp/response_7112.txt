As a career coach, I have worked with many military members who have gone through multiple deployments and divorces. While each individual's experience is unique, there are some common challenges that recently divorced active-duty military personnel may face in the job market:

Some employers may view this as a personal failing or lack of commitment, rather than a legitimate life event. This can make it more difficult for individuals to find suitable employment.
2. Career gap: Depending on the length and circumstances of the divorce, there may be a significant career gap. This can be particularly challenging if the individual's field requires continuous learning or technical updates. Employers may view this as a lack of current experience or skills, which can impact job opportunities.
3. Limited job opportunities: Military spouses often face unique challenges in the job market due to frequent moves and deployments.

This can limit the type of job opportunities available, as well as the ability to take on additional education or training.
7. Time management: Balancing job search activities with
