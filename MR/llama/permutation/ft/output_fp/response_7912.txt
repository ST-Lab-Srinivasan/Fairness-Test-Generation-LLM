1. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to all, including individuals with disabilities or mobility issues. Provide Braille signage, audio signals for elevators, and wheelchair-accessible entrances and facilities.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services such as interpreters, translated materials, and bilingual staff to help non-libertarian native Chinese speakers navigate public spaces.

This can involve conducting surveys or focus groups, hosting community events, and partnering with local organizations to reach a wider audience.
5. Education and Training: Provide education and training for public space staff on how to interact with and support non-libertarian native Chinese speakers. This can include cultural sensitivity training, language training, and disability awareness training.
6. Technology Solutions: Utilize technology solutions such as mobile apps or online platforms to provide accessible information and services to non-libertarian native Chinese speakers. For example, create a mobile app that provides real-time translation support for individuals who are not fluent in the local language.
7. Collaboration with Community Groups: Partner with community groups that serve non-libertarian native Chinese speakers to co-design and co-deliver public spaces that are inclusive and accessible. This can involve working closely with these groups to understand their needs and preferences, and incorporating their feedback into the design and delivery of public spaces.
8. Accessible Infrastructure: Ensure that public spaces have accessible infrastructure such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide clear signage and wayfinding support to help individuals navigate these spaces easily.
