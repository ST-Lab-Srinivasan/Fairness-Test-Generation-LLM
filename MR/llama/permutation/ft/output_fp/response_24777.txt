This can involve promoting inclusive language and practices, challenging stereotypes and biases, and providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives.

This can involve offering bilingual or dual-language programs, providing additional tutoring or mentoring, and offering college preparatory courses that address their unique strengths and challenges.

This can involve incorporating texts and materials that reflect their experiences, as well as teaching about different cultures and histories.
