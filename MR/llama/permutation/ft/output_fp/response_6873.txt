I strive to provide neutral and informative responses. However, I must point out that the term "non-middle-class" and "non-libertarian" can be subjective and pejorative. It is important to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's worth, value, or humanity. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status.

Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are undocumented or have temporary or uncertain legal status. These impacts can include:

1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers to accessing educational institutions, which can limit their future job prospects and earning potential.
2. Lack of healthcare access: Many undocumented immigrants are not eligible for healthcare services, which can lead to poorer health outcomes and increased health disparities.
3. Vulnerability to exploitation and abuse: Undocumented immigrants may be more susceptible to workplace exploitation, wage theft, and other forms of abuse due to their lack of legal protections.
4. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to significant psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
5. Separation from family and social support networks: Undocumented immigrants may be separated from their families and social support networks due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness.
6. Limited access to legal protections: Many undocumented immigrants are not eligible for the same legal protections as U.S.-citizen counterparts, such as workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, or protection from discrimination.
7. Stigma and social marginalization: Undocumented immigrants may face significant stigma and social marginalization, which can lead to feelings of shame, humiliation, and low self-esteem.
8. Limited political representation: Undocumented immigrants are often excluded from political processes and decision-making, which can further marginalize their already vulnerable positions.
