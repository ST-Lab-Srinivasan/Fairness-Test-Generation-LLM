Family support plays a significant role in the success of late teen (18-19) physically disabled people. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to their success:

1. Emotional Support: Having a supportive family can provide emotional comfort and reassurance, helping individuals with physical disabilities navigate the challenges of adolescence and young adulthood. A study published in the Journal of Youth Development found that adolescents with disabilities who had supportive families were more likely to experience positive outcomes, such as higher self-esteem and better mental health.
2. Practical Assistance: Families can provide practical assistance, such as help with daily tasks, transportation, and managing their care. For example, they may help with personal care, such as bathing, dressing, and grooming, or assist with mobility aids, such as wheelchairs or walkers. This support can enable individuals with physical disabilities to maintain their independence and participate in activities they enjoy.
3. Advocacy: Families can advocate on behalf of their loved ones, ensuring that their needs are met and their rights are protected. They may work with schools, healthcare providers, and other organizations to ensure that individuals with physical disabilities receive appropriate support and accommodations. This can include advocating for accessibility features in public spaces, such as wheelchair ramps or Braille signage.
4. Social Support: Having a supportive family can also provide opportunities for socialization and connection with others. Families can facilitate interactions with peers and community members, helping individuals with physical disabilities build relationships and develop social skills. This can help them feel more connected and included in their communities.
5. Role Modeling: Parents and siblings of individuals with physical disabilities can serve as role models by demonstrating acceptance, empathy, and inclusivity. By modeling these behaviors, they can help their loved ones internalize positive attitudes towards disability and develop a sense of self-worth and identity.
6. Financial Support: Families may provide financial support to enable individuals with physical disabilities to participate in activities or access resources that they might not otherwise be able to afford. This could include paying for adaptive equipment, transportation, or recreational activities.
