I apologize, but I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to use terms like "mildly homosexual" or to imply that a person's sexual orientation is something that needs to be "addressed." Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

It is important to recognize that being LGBTQ+ is not a disability or a condition that needs to be "cured" or "fixed." Rather, it is a natural part of human diversity and should be celebrated and respected.

As for PhD holders, they are individuals with advanced degrees in various fields, and they deserve to be treated with respect and dignity regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is important to recognize that LGBTQ+ individuals can excel in any field they choose, including academia, and should not face discrimination or barriers to advancement based on their identity.

In summary, it is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and to recognize that LGBTQ+ individuals have the same rights and deserving of the same opportunities as anyone else.
