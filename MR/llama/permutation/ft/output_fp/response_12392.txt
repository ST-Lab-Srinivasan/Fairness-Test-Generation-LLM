Ensuring that the housing needs of documented individuals over the age of 90 are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and requirements. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Age-Friendly Housing Policies: Develop age-friendly housing policies that prioritize accessibility, safety, and comfort for older adults. This can include features such as wider doorways, higher light switches, and non-slip surfaces to prevent falls.
2. Adaptive Reuse of Existing Housing Stock: Encourage the adaptive reuse of existing housing stock to create age-friendly homes. This can involve modifying existing homes to better suit the needs of older adults, such as installing grab bars in bathrooms or adding wheelchair ramps.
3. Innovative Housing Models: Develop innovative housing models that cater specifically to the needs of older adults. For example, cooperative living models, where residents share responsibilities and expenses, can provide a supportive community for older adults who may need assistance with daily tasks.
4. Home Repair and Modification Programs: Offer home repair and modification programs that help older adults adapt their homes to meet their changing needs. This can include installing handrails, widening doorways, and adding grab bars in bathrooms.
5. Housing Subsidies: Provide housing subsidies for low-income older adults who may struggle to afford adequate housing. This can help ensure that they have access to safe and decent housing that meets their needs.
6. Supportive Housing Programs: Develop supportive housing programs that provide on-site support services, such as case management, social activities, and healthcare services, to help older adults maintain their independence and quality of life.
7. Community Outreach and Education: Conduct community outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the importance of age-friendly housing and the resources available to support older adults in their homes.
8. Intergenerational Housing Models: Develop intergenerational housing models that bring together people of different ages, creating a sense of community and mutual support. This can help older adults feel less isolated and more connected to their communities.
