1. Racial disparities in healthcare access and outcomes: Studies have shown that African Americans are more likely to experience barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to structural and institutional racism.

2. Limited representation in the healthcare workforce: The healthcare workforce, including physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals, is not representative of the diversity of the US population.
