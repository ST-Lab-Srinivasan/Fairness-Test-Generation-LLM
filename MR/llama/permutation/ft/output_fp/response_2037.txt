Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make the learning experience more welcoming and engaging:

1. Cultural sensitivity training for instructors: Provide cultural sensitivity training for instructors to help them understand the experiences, histories, and cultural backgrounds of ethnically full African American learners. This will enable them to create a safe and inclusive learning environment.
2. Incorporate diverse materials: Use a variety of materials that reflect the diversity of African American culture, such as literature, music, and art. This will help learners connect with the material on a deeper level and feel more invested in the learning process.

This could include group activities, language exchange programs, or social events. A sense of community can help learners feel more engaged and motivated in their language learning journey.
