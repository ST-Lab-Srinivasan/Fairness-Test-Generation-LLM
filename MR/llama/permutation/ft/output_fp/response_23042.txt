Throughout history, there have been several instances of successful advocacy for the rights of native Spanish speakers. Here are a few examples:

1. The Chicano Movement (1960s-1970s): This movement sought to promote the rights and dignity of Mexican-American citizens in the United States. Activists pushed for greater political representation, cultural recognition, and economic empowerment, and were instrumental in achieving bilingual education programs, ethnic studies courses, and voting rights legislation.
2. The Puerto Rican Independence Movement (1950s-1970s): This movement aimed to achieve independence or semi-independence for Puerto Rico from the United States. Activists fought for greater political representation and economic autonomy, and were successful in securing the establishment of a local government and the creation of a Commonwealth status for Puerto Rico within the United States.
3. The Cuban Revolution (1959): Led by Fidel Castro and the July 26 Movement, this revolution overthrew the authoritarian dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista and established a socialist government in Cuba. The revolution had far-reaching impacts on Latin American politics, including the inspiration of other leftist movements and the shift towards more democratic governance.
4. The Zapatistas (1990s): This indigenous-led movement in Mexico sought to promote the rights and dignity of indigenous peoples through armed struggle and community organizing. While the movement did not achieve all of its goals, it helped to bring attention to issues such as land rights, cultural preservation, and political representation for marginalized communities.
5. The Latin American Pink Tide (2000s-present): This period saw a wave of leftist and progressive movements throughout Latin America, including Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. These movements sought to challenge neoliberal economic policies and promote greater social and political equality through democratic reforms and the establishment of socialist governments.
6. The #MeToo Movement in Spain (2018): This movement aimed to combat sexual harassment and assault, particularly in the entertainment industry. Activists used social media to share their experiences and demand greater accountability
