Ensuring the educational needs of non-lower-class individuals over 90 years old can be challenging due to various factors, including physical and cognitive limitations, lack of access to technology and resources, and societal attitudes towards aging. However, there are several strategies that can help meet their educational needs:

1. Age-Friendly Learning Environments: Create age-friendly learning environments that cater to the unique needs of older adults. This includes providing comfortable seating and lighting, simplifying content and instructions, and using multimedia tools such as videos and audio recordings to engage learners.
