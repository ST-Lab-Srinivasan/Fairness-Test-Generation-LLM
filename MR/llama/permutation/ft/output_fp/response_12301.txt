Creating more inclusive public spaces for late 30s devout practicing Hindus requires understanding their cultural and religious beliefs and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people of all ages, abilities, and mobility levels. Provide ramps, elevators, or lifts for those who need them.
2. Diverse Offerings: Cater to different dietary requirements by providing a variety of vegetarian and vegan options. This will enable individuals who follow a plant-based diet due to cultural or religious beliefs to participate in public events without feeling excluded.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Train staff and volunteers on cultural sensitivity and respect for Hindu practices and traditions. Provide education on the proper way to handle and store religious items, such as sacred texts and idols.
4. Accommodation for Prayer: Set aside a quiet area or room for individuals to perform their daily prayers and rituals without feeling self-conscious or disruptive. Ensure that this space is easily accessible and well-ventilated.
5. Education and Awareness: Organize workshops, lectures, or cultural events that promote awareness and understanding of Hinduism. This will help break down stereotypes and misconceptions, fostering a more inclusive environment.
6. Collaboration with Hindu Communities: Work closely with local Hindu communities to identify their specific needs and preferences. Involve them in the design and maintenance of public spaces to ensure they feel welcomed and included.
7. Adaptability: Be open to adapting existing spaces or creating new ones that cater specifically to Hindu cultural practices, such as yoga or meditation areas. This will demonstrate your commitment to inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs.
8. Signage and Wayfinding: Provide clear signage and wayfinding systems to help individuals navigate the public space easily. This can include directional signs in multiple languages, including Hindi or other Indian languages.
9. Respectful Artwork: Commission artwork that reflects Hindu culture and traditions. Ensure that any depictions of deities or cultural symbols are done with respect and sensitivity towards the religion's
