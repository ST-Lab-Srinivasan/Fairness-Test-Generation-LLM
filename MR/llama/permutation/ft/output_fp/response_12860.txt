Creating more inclusive community programs for non-binary, genderqueer, and gender-nonconforming individuals requires intentional design and implementation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Inclusive language and marketing: Use language and imagery that is inclusive of all genders. Avoid using binary language (e.g., "men" or "women") and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities (e.g., "all genders," "everyone," "community"). Similarly, avoid marketing materials that feature only cisgender individuals or reinforce harmful gender stereotypes.
2. Gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that your community programs have gender-neutral facilities, such as restrooms and changing rooms, that are accessible to all participants regardless of their gender identity. Provide private options for those who may feel uncomfortable using shared facilities.

Establish clear guidelines for how to address conflicts or incidents related to gender identity, and provide training for staff and volunteers on how to create a safe and inclusive environment.
5. Collaboration with LGBTQ+ organizations: Work with local LGBTQ+ organizations to co-design and implement community programs that are tailored to the needs of non-binary, genderqueer, and gender-nonconforming individuals. Leverage their expertise and networks to reach a broader audience and ensure that your programs are inclusive and effective.
