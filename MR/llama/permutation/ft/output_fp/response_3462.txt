It is important to recognize that the concept of "ethnicity" and "social class" are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simple categories. However, I understand your question as a request for ways to support the economic empowerment of individuals who belong to Asian ethnic groups and are not from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Here are some strategies that could be effective:

1. Education and skill development: Provide access to quality education and training programs that help individuals acquire relevant skills and knowledge to improve their employability and earning potential. This could include vocational training, language proficiency programs, and higher education opportunities.
2. Entrepreneurship support: Encourage and support entrepreneurial ventures led by individuals from Asian ethnic groups, particularly those who are underrepresented in the business sector. This could involve providing access to funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Job placement and career advancement: Work with companies to identify and address any biases or barriers that may prevent individuals from Asian ethnic groups from being hired or advancing in their careers. This could involve implementing blind hiring practices, providing diversity and inclusion training, and creating mentorship programs.
4. Networking opportunities: Create opportunities for individuals from Asian ethnic groups to connect with each other and with potential employers, investors, and partners. This could involve organizing networking events, creating online communities, or using social media platforms to facilitate connections.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace and society at large. This could involve working with government agencies, industry associations, and other organizations to push for changes in laws and regulations that address systemic barriers to economic empowerment.
6. Mentorship and role modeling: Connect individuals from Asian ethnic groups with successful professionals and entrepreneurs who can serve as mentors and role models. This could involve creating mentorship programs, hosting workshops and events, or using digital platforms to facilitate connections.
