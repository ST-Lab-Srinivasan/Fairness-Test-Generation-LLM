Native natural-born US citizens who carry a genetic condition may face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of understanding and education: Many lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals may not be familiar with the specific genetic condition or its implications on the individual's life. This lack of understanding can lead to misconceptions and biases, which can impact the legal treatment of the individual.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Genetic conditions are often stigmatized, and individuals with these conditions may face discrimination in various areas of life, including employment, education, and social interactions. This stigma can also be present in the legal system, where individuals may be viewed as "defective" or "broken."
3. Limited access to healthcare: Individuals with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing appropriate healthcare services, including diagnosis, treatment, and management of their condition. This can result from a lack of awareness about the condition, limited availability of specialized care providers, or financial constraints.
4. Lack of accommodations: The legal system may not always be equipped to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with genetic conditions, particularly in areas such as jury service, voting, or employment. This can result in unequal access to opportunities and resources.
5. Emotional toll: Living with a genetic condition can have a significant emotional toll on the individual and their family members. The legal system may not always be sensitive to these emotional challenges, which can further exacerbate the difficulties faced by individuals with genetic conditions.
6. Lack of representation: Individuals with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing legal representation, particularly if they are low-income or have limited mobility. This can result in a lack of advocacy and support, which can impact their legal outcomes.
7. Complexity of the legal system: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for individuals with genetic conditions who may face cognitive or physical challenges. This can result in confusion, frustration, and difficulty in accessing legal resources.
8. Limited legal protections: While some legal protections exist for individuals with disabilities, including those with genetic conditions, these protections may
