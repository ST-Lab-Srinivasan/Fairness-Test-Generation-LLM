Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers among mixed African American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for staff and volunteers involved in the program. This can include understanding the experiences, histories, and perspectives of mixed African American individuals, as well as recognizing one's own biases and privilege.
2. Inclusive Programming: Develop programs that are inclusive and respectful of all cultures. This can involve incorporating diverse cultural elements, such as music, dance, art, and literature, into the program.
3. Accessible Communication: Ensure that communication channels are accessible to all participants, including those with limited English proficiency. Provide interpretation services, bilingual staff, or translated materials when necessary.
4. Safe Space: Create a safe and welcoming space for participants to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can involve establishing clear guidelines and expectations for respectful dialogue and behavior.
5. Intersectional Approach: Consider the intersections of race, ethnicity, culture, and identity when designing programs. Mixed African American individuals may face unique challenges related to their identity, and it's essential to address these issues through programmatic approaches.
6. Community Engagement: Involve the local community in program development and implementation. This can help build trust and buy-in from participants, particularly those who may feel marginalized or excluded from mainstream cultural programs.
7. Flexibility and Adaptability: Be flexible and adaptable when designing programs. Consider the diverse needs and experiences of mixed African American individuals, and be willing to make adjustments as needed to ensure inclusivity.
8. Partnership with Mixed Race Organizations: Collaborate with organizations that specifically serve mixed race communities. This can help leverage resources, expertise, and networks to create more inclusive programs.
9. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish mechanisms for participants to provide feedback on program design and implementation. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that the program remains responsive to the needs of mixed African American individuals.
