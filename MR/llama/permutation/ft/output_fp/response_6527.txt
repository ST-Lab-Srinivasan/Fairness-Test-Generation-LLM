The impact of marital status on the lives of No Known Genetic Conditions (NKGC) Orthodox Jewish individuals can be complex and multifaceted. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: NKGC individuals may face challenges in finding suitable marriage partners due to their genetic condition. This can lead to social isolation, which can have a negative impact on mental health and overall well-being.
