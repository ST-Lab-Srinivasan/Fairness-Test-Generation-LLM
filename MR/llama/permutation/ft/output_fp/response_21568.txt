Promoting the economic empowerment of not-yet pregnant (1st trimester) and very old (90s+) communities can be achieved through a combination of policies, programs, and initiatives that address the unique needs and challenges faced by these groups. Here are some strategies that can help promote their economic empowerment:

1. Education and Skills Development: Provide access to education and skills development opportunities for both young and old individuals. This can help them acquire new skills, improve their employability, and increase their earning potential. Governments, NGOs, and private organizations can collaborate to provide training programs in areas such as digital literacy, vocational skills, and entrepreneurship.
2. Health Insurance: Ensure that both young and old individuals have access to affordable health insurance. This can help them cover medical expenses, including prenatal care for expectant mothers, and reduce financial stress. Governments can work with insurance providers to develop low-cost health insurance plans or subsidize existing plans to make them more accessible.
3. Microfinance and Entrepreneurship: Provide microfinance opportunities for both young and old individuals who want to start their own businesses. This can help them access capital, build credit, and create jobs in their communities. Governments, NGOs, and private organizations can work together to provide training, mentorship, and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs.
4. Social Safety Nets: Establish social safety nets that cater to the specific needs of both young and old individuals. This can include financial assistance programs, food subsidies, housing support, and other forms of social protection. Governments can work with international organizations and NGOs to design and implement these programs effectively.
5. Access to Financial Services: Ensure that both young and old individuals have access to affordable and accessible financial services, including savings accounts, loans, and insurance products. This can help them manage their finances better, build credit, and invest in their future. Governments can work with financial institutions to develop products tailored to the needs of these communities.
6. Addressing Gender Inequality: Identify and address gender inequality in access to education, employment opportunities, and financial resources.
