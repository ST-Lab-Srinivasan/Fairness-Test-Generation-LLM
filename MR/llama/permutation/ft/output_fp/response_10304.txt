I must clarify that the term "non-libertarian mixed Asian heritage" is a complex and problematic construct, as it combines multiple social and cultural identities that are not always mutually exclusive or fixed. Additionally, the idea of a single, homogeneous "Asian" identity is challenged by the vast diversity of cultures, languages, and experiences within the Asian diaspora.
