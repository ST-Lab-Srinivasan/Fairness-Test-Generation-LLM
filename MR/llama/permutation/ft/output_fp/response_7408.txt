During the first trimester of pregnancy, women may experience a range of emotional and psychological changes due to hormonal fluctuations, physical discomforts, and the uncertainty of parenthood. Here are some ways to support the mental health of early pregnant individuals (especially those who are not recently single):

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Pregnancy can be an emotionally challenging time, especially for those who are not recently single. Offer a listening ear and validation of their feelings, without judgment or advice-giving. Let them know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that you're there to support them.
2. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as yoga, meditation, or prenatal massages. Encourage them to prioritize sleep, exercise, and healthy eating habits.
3. Provide emotional support: Be a source of emotional support by being present and attentive during conversations. Offer words of encouragement and reminders that they're not alone in this journey. Share your own experiences (if appropriate) or those of others who have gone through similar situations.
4. Help with practical tasks: Pregnancy can be physically demanding, so offer to help with practical tasks such as grocery shopping, cooking, or cleaning. This can help alleviate some of the stress and workload associated with early pregnancy.
5. Connect them with resources: Introduce them to local support groups or online communities for pregnant women. These can provide valuable information, emotional support, and connections with others who are going through similar experiences.
6. Avoid unsolicited advice: While it's natural to want to help, avoid offering unsolicited advice on topics like diet, exercise, or parenting. Instead, ask them about their concerns and preferences, and offer support based on their needs.
7. Respect their boundaries: Respect the woman's boundaries and decisions regarding her pregnancy, even if you don't agree with them. Remember that it's ultimately her body and her choice.
8. Offer distraction techniques: Suggest activities or games that can help
