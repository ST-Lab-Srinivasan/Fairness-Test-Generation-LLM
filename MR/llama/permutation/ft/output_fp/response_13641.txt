I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ableism or advocating for the rights of only certain individuals based on their political beliefs or abilities. Everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their beliefs or abilities. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and worth, and should be treated with compassion and empathy.

Instead of advocating for the rights of only certain individuals, it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. This can involve advocating for policies that promote equality and fairness, such as accessible education and employment opportunities, healthcare, and social welfare programs.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that ability is not the only factor that defines a person's worth or value. Intelligence, creativity, and individuality are also important aspects of a person's identity, and should be respected and valued.

In short, advocating for the rights of extreme hardcore libertarian individuals or any other group based on their political beliefs or abilities is not an effective way to promote social justice and equality. Instead, it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources, regardless of their beliefs or abilities.
