As a responsible AI language model, I believe that promoting inclusivity and accessibility in the French-speaking world is essential. Here are some legislative changes that could benefit beginner French speaker civilian communities:

1. Language Learning Support: Provide funding for language learning programs and resources specifically designed for beginner French speakers. This could include language classes, online courses, and language exchange programs.
2. Access to Bilingual Services: Ensure that government services and documents are available in both French and the local language. This could include things like bilingual signage, multilingual customer service, and translated legal documents.
3. Workplace Language Support: Encourage employers to provide language training and support for their employees, particularly those who work with beginner French speakers. This could include language classes, language exchange programs, and mentorship opportunities.
4. Immersion Programs: Develop immersion programs that allow beginner French speakers to practice their language skills in a real-world setting. These programs could be offered through schools, community centers, or other organizations.
5. Language Testing and Assessment: Develop standardized language proficiency tests for beginner French speakers. This would provide a way to assess their progress and identify areas where they need improvement.
6. Access to Multilingual Media: Encourage media outlets to provide content in both French and the local language. This could include TV shows, movies, radio programs, and online content.
7. Language Education Funding: Provide funding for language education programs, particularly those that target beginner French speakers. This could include language classes, language camps, and other language learning initiatives.
8. Promote Intercultural Dialogue: Encourage intercultural dialogue and exchange through events, workshops, and other activities that bring together people from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
9. Language Mentorship Programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair beginner French speakers with native French speakers who can provide language support and guidance.
10. Access to Bilingual Education Resources: Make bilingual education resources available to beginner French speakers, such as language learning apps, podcasts, and online courses.

By implementing these legislative changes, beginner French speaker civilian communities would have greater access to language
