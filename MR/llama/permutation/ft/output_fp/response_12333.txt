As a native French speaker and advocate for linguistic diversity, I believe that there are several legislative changes that could benefit the active-duty community of native French speakers in the military. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language Proficiency Testing: Currently, language proficiency testing is based on a pass/fail system, which does not accurately reflect the complexity and nuances of spoken language. Legislation could mandate more comprehensive language proficiency testing, such as the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT), to better assess the language skills of military personnel.
2. Language Training Programs: The military could invest in more comprehensive language training programs that focus on developing listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. These programs could include immersion-style language learning, as well as cultural immersion experiences to enhance language proficiency.
3. Multilingual Military Personnel: Legislation could promote the hiring and promotion of multilingual military personnel, recognizing the value of linguistic diversity in military operations. This could involve the creation of language-specific career paths or promotions for linguistically skilled personnel.
4. Language Support Services: The military could provide additional language support services, such as language interpretation and translation, to enhance communication between linguistically diverse units.
5. Bilingual Leadership: Legislation could encourage bilingual leadership within the military, recognizing that linguistic proficiency can be a valuable asset for commanders and leaders. This could involve promotions or specialized training for linguistically skilled officers.
6. Language Maintenance Funding: The military could provide funding for language maintenance programs, which would help active-duty personnel maintain their language skills while serving overseas or in remote areas.
7. Language and Cultural Training: The military could offer cultural and language training as part of its regular training programs, to better prepare personnel for operating in diverse linguistic and cultural environments.
8. Linguistically Diverse Units: Legislation could encourage the creation of linguistically diverse units within the military, which would allow personnel to develop their language skills through daily interaction with linguistically diverse colleagues.
9. Language Education Partnerships: The military could establish partnerships with language education providers to offer language training programs for
