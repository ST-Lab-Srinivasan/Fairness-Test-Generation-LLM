Ensuring that the voices of beginner Spanish speakers are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, especially if they are not recently single individuals. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Establish a welcoming and comfortable environment where beginner Spanish speakers feel free to express themselves. This could involve using language and communication strategies that are accessible to all levels of proficiency.
2. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to help beginner Spanish speakers convey their ideas. Non-verbal communication can be an effective way to bridge the gap between languages and levels of proficiency.
3. Encourage participation: Foster an atmosphere of active listening and encouragement. Make sure that all participants feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions, regardless of their language proficiency.
4. Provide translation support: Offer translation support to beginner Spanish speakers who may need help understanding the discussion or expressing themselves in Spanish. This could involve providing real-time translations through technology or assigning a dedicated translator to the group.
5. Use interpreters: Consider hiring professional interpreters who are fluent in both Spanish and the dominant language of the decision-making process. This can help ensure that beginner Spanish speakers are able to fully participate in discussions and decisions.
6. Build trust: Establish a culture of trust and respect within the group. Encourage participants to be open and honest about their thoughts and opinions, and avoid making assumptions based on language proficiency.
7. Be patient: Recognize that beginner Spanish speakers may need more time to process information or express themselves in Spanish. Be patient and give them the space they need to feel comfortable and confident.
8. Offer language support: Provide resources and support for beginner Spanish speakers to improve their language skills. This could involve offering language classes, providing access to language learning materials, or connecting them with language exchange programs.
9. Foster a sense of community: Encourage beginner Spanish speakers to connect with one another and build relationships within the group. This can help create a sense of belonging and motivation to participate in decision-making processes.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of language proficiency levels
