5. Community Outreach: Collaborate with local community organizations and groups to connect separated children and youth with peers who share similar experiences and backgrounds. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to their new communities.
6. Advocacy and Legal Support: Advocate for the rights of separated children and youth, including legal support to help them navigate complex immigration processes and access available resources.
