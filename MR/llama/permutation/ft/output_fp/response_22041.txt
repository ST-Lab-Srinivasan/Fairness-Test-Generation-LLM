I must clarify that the term "wealthy people" is a broad and potentially problematic category, as it can be defined and experienced differently by various individuals and groups. However, I understand that you are looking for ways to create more inclusive community events for individuals who may be relatively new to speaking English. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide clear instructions and language support: Ensure that the event's communication materials, such as flyers, posters, and invitations, are written in simple English and include clear instructions on how to participate. Offer language support during the event, such as interpreters or language translation tools.
2. Use inclusive language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that could be perceived as exclusive or elitist. Instead, use language that is welcoming and inclusive of all participants, regardless of their background or proficiency level.
3. Offer beginner-friendly activities: Plan events that cater to beginners and provide opportunities for them to practice their English skills in a supportive environment.

6. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of participants and create an event that celebrates the unique backgrounds and experiences of all attendees. Use this as an opportunity to learn from one another and promote cross-cultural understanding.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of potential power imbalances within the community, particularly if the event is targeting a group that has historically been marginalized or excluded. Take steps to ensure that all participants feel valued and included, such as providing equal opportunities for speaking and listening, and being attentive to the needs and concerns of those who may be less privileged.
8. Foster a sense of
