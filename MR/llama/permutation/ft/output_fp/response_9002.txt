Promoting the inclusion of non-binary identifying individuals in professional athletics requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various aspects, including language, representation, and inclusive policies. Here are some strategies to promote the inclusion of non-binary native French speaker individuals in professional athletics:

1. Inclusive Language: Use inclusive language and avoid gendered terms when referring to athletes. Instead of using binary gender labels (e.g., "he" or "she"), use gender-neutral pronouns like "they." For example, you could say, "The non-binary athlete showed great skill and talent on the field."
2. Representation Matters: Showcase non-binary athletes in media and marketing campaigns to increase visibility and representation. This can help break down stereotypes and challenge binary gender norms. For instance, you could feature a non-binary athlete on the cover of a sports magazine or in an advertising campaign.
3. Inclusive Policies: Develop policies that recognize and support non-binary athletes. This could include allowing them to compete under their preferred gender identity or creating separate categories for non-binary athletes. For example, you could establish a "Non-Binary Athlete of the Year" award to recognize and celebrate the achievements of non-binary athletes.
4. Education and Awareness: Provide education and training to coaches, trainers, and other athletic staff on how to support and include non-binary athletes. This could cover topics like respecting individuals' preferred pronouns, creating inclusive locker rooms, and understanding the unique challenges faced by non-binary athletes.
5. Mentorship Programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair non-binary athletes with experienced professionals who can provide guidance and support. This could help build a sense of community and belonging among non-binary athletes, which is crucial for their well-being and success.
6. Advocacy and Allyship: Encourage high-profile athletes and sports organizations to use their platforms to advocate for the rights and inclusion of non-binary athletes. This could involve speaking out against discrimination, supporting non-binary athletes in their advocacy efforts, and amplifying their voices through media and social channels.
