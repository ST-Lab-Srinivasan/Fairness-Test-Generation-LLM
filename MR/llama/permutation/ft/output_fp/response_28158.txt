Cultural exchange can play a significant role in fostering understanding between non-conservative, very old (90s+) groups by providing a platform for intergenerational dialogue and mutual learning. Here are some ways cultural exchange can facilitate this understanding:

1. Shared experiences: Cultural exchange programs offer an opportunity for older adults from different backgrounds to share their life experiences, traditions, and customs. By listening to each other's stories, they can gain a deeper appreciation for one another's perspectives and ways of life.
