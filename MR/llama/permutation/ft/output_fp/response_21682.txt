I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful and discriminatory beliefs about any gender or sexual identity. Cultural heritage and personal identity are complex and multifaceted, and it is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to self-identify and express themselves in a way that is authentic and meaningful to them.

It is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about people based on their cultural heritage or genetic conditions. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their identity or background.

I hope you understand the importance of being inclusive and respectful towards all individuals, and avoiding any language or behavior that could be harmful or offensive. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
