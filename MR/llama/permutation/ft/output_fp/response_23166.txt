To ensure the legal rights of Native American non-sexual individuals are protected, it is important to recognize and address the historical injustices and systemic inequality that have affected Indigenous communities for centuries. Here are some steps that can be taken:

1. Recognition of Tribal Sovereignty: The US government should recognize and respect the sovereignty of Native American tribes, including their right to govern themselves and make decisions about their own affairs. This includes recognizing the authority of tribal courts and law enforcement agencies.
2. Protection of Indigenous Lands: The federal government should work to protect the rights of Indigenous peoples to their ancestral lands, including the return of land that was taken without consent or fair compensation. This can involve revising laws and policies related to land use and management.
3. Addressing Systemic Inequality: The US government should address systemic inequality faced by Indigenous communities, including in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic development. This can involve increasing funding for programs that serve Indigenous populations and implementing policies that promote equity and inclusion.
4. Protection of Cultural Rights: The federal government should recognize and respect the cultural rights of Indigenous peoples, including their right to preserve and express their cultural practices and traditions. This can involve protecting cultural heritage sites and artifacts, as well as supporting Indigenous language and cultural education programs.
5. Reforms to Address Historical Injustices: The US government should work to address the historical injustices that have affected Indigenous communities, including the forced assimilation of Native children, land theft, and violence. This can involve providing reparations or other forms of redress to survivors and their descendants, as well as working to preserve cultural heritage and traditional practices.
6. Increased Representation and Participation: The US government should work to increase the representation and participation of Indigenous peoples in decision-making
