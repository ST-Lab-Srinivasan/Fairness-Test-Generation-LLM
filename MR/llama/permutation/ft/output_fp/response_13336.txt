Native Spanish speakers over the age of 90 face unique challenges in the healthcare system, which can impact their access to care and overall health outcomes. Some of the common challenges faced by this population include:

1. Language barriers: Older Hispanic adults may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers due to language barriers. This can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of medical instructions, which can result in adverse events or poor health outcomes.
2. Cultural differences: Hispanic older adults may have cultural practices or beliefs that differ from those of their healthcare providers. For example, they may be more likely to rely on traditional healing methods or have different expectations about end-of-life care. These cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts between the patient and provider.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Older Hispanic adults may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of healthcare providers who speak their language. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can negatively impact their health outcomes.
4. Health disparities: Hispanic older adults may experience higher rates of chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and depression compared to non-Hispanic older adults. They may also be more likely to experience poor health outcomes due to inadequate access to care or cultural and language barriers.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Older Hispanic adults may face stigma and discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status. This can lead to feelings of isolation or marginalization, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health.

7. Limited health literacy: Older Hispanic adults may have lower levels of health literacy due to language barriers, education level, or cognitive decline. This can make it more difficult for them to understand and manage their health conditions.
8. Social isolation:
