As an AI language model, I can suggest some potential legislative changes that could benefit both beginner and veteran English speaker communities:

1. Visa options for English language learners: Introduce more flexible visa options for individuals who wish to study or work in English-speaking countries. This could include longer validity periods, multiple entry points, or even a "study abroad" visa specifically designed for language learners.
2. Financial support for language learning: Provide grants or scholarships to support individuals in their English language learning journey. This could include funding for language courses, study materials, and even travel expenses to access quality language training programs.
3. Language training for employment purposes: Offer subsidies or tax incentives to companies that provide language training programs specifically designed for employees who are non-native English speakers. This could help bridge the gap between beginner and veteran English speaker communities by providing opportunities for professional development and career advancement.
4. Language exchange programs: Encourage the establishment of language exchange programs, where beginners can practice speaking with more experienced English speakers in a supportive environment. This could involve regular meetups or online sessions, allowing both parties to benefit from each other's company.
5. Accessible English language resources: Develop and promote free or low-cost English language learning resources, such as mobile apps, online courses, or podcasts. This would provide beginners with a more accessible way of improving their English skills without incurring significant financial costs.
6. Language assessment and evaluation standards: Establish standardized language assessment and evaluation procedures to ensure that both beginner and veteran English speakers can demonstrate their proficiency levels accurately. This could involve creating a framework for measuring language skills in various contexts, such as workplace communication or academic settings.
7. Professional development opportunities: Offer training and workshop programs specifically designed for beginner English speakers who are seeking to enhance their language skills for professional purposes. This could include topics such as business English, technical writing, or public speaking.
8. Language mentorship programs: Pair beginners with more experienced English speakers who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement throughout their language learning journey. This could involve regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and shared language learning experiences.
