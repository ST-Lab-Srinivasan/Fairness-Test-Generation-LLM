Ensuring the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizens, particularly those from moderate-income backgrounds, can be addressed through a combination of policy interventions and strategic investments. Here are some steps that can be taken:

1. Universal Health Coverage (UHC): Implementing UHC can help ensure that all citizens, regardless of their income level, have access to quality healthcare. Under UHC, the government would provide financial protection to citizens through a combination of public and private providers, allowing them to access healthcare services without worrying about costs.
2. Health Insurance: Introducing a robust health insurance scheme can help moderate-income individuals afford quality healthcare services. The government or private players can offer subsidies or tax incentives to encourage more people to purchase health insurance policies.
3. Public Health Infrastructure: Strengthening public health infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic facilities, can improve access to healthcare services for all citizens, especially those from low-income backgrounds. The government can invest in upgrading existing facilities or building new ones in underserved areas.
4. Telemedicine: Leveraging telemedicine can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas, making healthcare more accessible to people living in remote regions. This can be achieved by establishing telemedicine centers or partnering with private providers to offer virtual consultations.
5. Training and Capacity Building: Providing training and capacity-building programs for healthcare professionals can help improve the quality of care provided to patients, particularly those from marginalized communities. This can include training on culturally sensitive care, patient navigation, and language support.
6. Community Health Workers (CHWs): Utilizing CHWs can help reach vulnerable populations, such as rural communities or slum dwellers, who may have limited access to healthcare services. CHWs can provide basic healthcare services, including disease diagnosis and treatment, maternal and child healthcare, and mental health support.
7. Addressing Social Determinants of Health: Many health disparities are rooted in social determinants such as poverty, education, and housing. Addressing these factors through policies that promote equity and inclusive growth can help improve overall health
