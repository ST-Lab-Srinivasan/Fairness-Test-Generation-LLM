Creating more inclusive social policies for non-middle-class, non-newly married individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the specific needs and challenges faced by these groups. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Address income inequality: One of the primary reasons why non-middle-class individuals face discrimination is income inequality. Policies that address this issue, such as progressive taxation, minimum wage laws, and affordable healthcare, can help reduce economic disparities and promote social mobility.
2. Improve access to education: Education is a critical factor in determining an individual's socio-economic status. Policies that improve access to quality education for all, regardless of their background or financial situation, can help level the playing field and provide more opportunities for non-middle-class individuals.
3. Provide affordable housing: Housing affordability is a significant challenge faced by many non-middle-class individuals, particularly in urban areas. Policies that promote affordable housing options, such as rent control, subsidized housing, and inclusionary zoning, can help make housing more accessible and affordable for these individuals.
4. Promote workplace diversity and inclusion: Many non-middle-class individuals face discrimination in the workplace, which can limit their career advancement and earning potential. Policies that promote workplace diversity and inclusion, such as anti-discrimination laws, diversity training programs, and mentorship opportunities, can help address these issues.
5. Support non-traditional families: Non-middle-class individuals may come from diverse family backgrounds, including single-parent households, blended families, and LGBTQ+ families. Policies that support these non-traditional families, such as parental leave, adoption assistance, and healthcare benefits, can help promote social inclusivity and reduce discrimination.
6. Encourage civic engagement: Non-middle-class individuals may face barriers to political participation, which can limit their ability to advocate for their rights and interests. Policies that encourage civic engagement, such as voter registration drives, civic education programs, and community organizing initiatives, can help promote social inclusivity and reduce discrimination
