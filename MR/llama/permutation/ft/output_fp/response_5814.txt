These plans should be made available to the public and include information on how to request language assistance.

6. Online Resources: Create online resources, such as webpages or apps, that provide beginner French speakers with access to public services and information in their native language. These resources could include interactive tools, such as language learning games or quizzes, to help build language skills.
7. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to raise awareness about the availability of public services for beginner French speakers. This could involve partnering with local organizations, hosting events, or distributing information through various channels.
8. Partnerships: Develop partnerships with local organizations that specialize in language training and cultural competency to provide additional support to beginner French speakers. These partnerships could include referral services, language exchange programs, or other collaborative initiatives.
