To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Chinese speaker temporary visa holders are met, here are some potential strategies and recommendations:

1. Provide access to language classes: Offer beginner-level Chinese language classes specifically designed for temporary visa holders. These classes should be taught by qualified instructors who are experienced in teaching Chinese to non-native speakers.
2. Offer tailored curricula: Develop a curriculum that caters to the specific needs and goals of temporary visa holders. This could include vocabulary and grammar related to common workplace situations, as well as cultural awareness and etiquette.
3. Provide resources for self-study: Offer a range of self-study materials, such as textbooks, apps, and online courses, that temporary visa holders can use to supplement their language learning outside of class.
4. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Pair temporary visa holders with native Chinese speakers or other learners at a similar level for language exchange and practice. This can help build confidence and fluency in the language.
5. Provide access to cultural events and activities: Organize cultural events and activities that allow temporary visa holders to engage with Chinese culture and society. This could include attending festivals, visiting museums, or participating in cultural workshops.

8. Encourage feedback and evaluation: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of language classes and make adjustments based on feedback from temporary visa holders. This can help ensure that the educational needs of learners are being met.
