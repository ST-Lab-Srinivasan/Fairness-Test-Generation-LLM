As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to avoid making generalizations or assumptions about any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin. Instead, we can use data to highlight the unique challenges and experiences faced by recent immigrants to the US, including native English speakers. Here are some ways we can do this:

1. Collect and analyze survey data: Conduct surveys among recent immigrants to gather information on their experiences, such as language barriers, cultural differences, and challenges in finding employment or accessing healthcare. Analyze the data to identify patterns and trends that highlight the specific issues faced by this group.
2. Study migration patterns: Use data to understand the demographics of recent immigrants, including their country of origin, age, education level, and occupation. This can help identify the factors that contribute to their experiences in the US.
3. Examine socioeconomic status: Analyze data on the socioeconomic status of recent immigrants, including their income levels, access to healthcare, and opportunities for education. This can help identify disparities in access to resources and opportunities that may affect their well-being.
4. Investigate discrimination: Use data to track instances of discrimination faced by recent immigrants, such as employment discrimination, housing discrimination, or racial profiling. This can help identify the ways in which systemic barriers may impact this group.
5. Monitor policy changes: Keep track of policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels that may affect recent immigrants, such as changes to immigration laws, voting rights, or access to social services. This can help identify how policies may impact the experiences of this group.
6. Examine cultural differences: Use data to understand the cultural differences between recent immigrants and the broader US population, including their values, beliefs, and practices. This can help identify areas where cultural barriers may exist and how they may affect interactions between different groups.
7. Study language acquisition: Collect data on the language proficiency of recent immigrants and analyze trends in language acquisition. This can help identify the challenges faced by this group in learning English and other languages.
