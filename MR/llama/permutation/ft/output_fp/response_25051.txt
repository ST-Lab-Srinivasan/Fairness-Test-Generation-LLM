The impact of immigration status on the lives of permanent residents can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal Certainty: Permanent residence status provides a measure of legal certainty and stability, allowing individuals to plan their lives without the constant threat of deportation or removal. This can lead to greater security and peace of mind.
2. Access to Healthcare: In many countries, permanent residents are eligible for publicly-funded healthcare services. This can be a significant benefit, especially for individuals with chronic conditions or disabilities.
3. Employment Opportunities: Permanent residence status often opens up employment opportunities that are not available to non-permanent residents. This can lead to greater economic stability and mobility.
4. Social Integration: Permanent residents may feel more integrated into their communities, as they are able to participate in civic life and access social services without fear of removal.
5. Family Reunification: Many countries allow permanent residents to sponsor family members for immigration, which can help to reunite families and create stronger social bonds.
6. Education Opportunities: Permanent residents may have access to educational opportunities that are not available to non-permanent residents, such as scholarships or financial aid.
7. Property Ownership: In some countries, permanent residents may be able to purchase property or own real estate, which can provide a sense of security and financial stability.
8. Voting Rights: Permanent residents may have the right to vote in local elections or participate in civic life, which can give them a greater sense of agency and control over their lives.
9. Social Services: Permanent residents may be eligible for social services such as housing assistance, food assistance, or other forms of support.
10. Psychological Impacts: The uncertainty and insecurity associated with non-permanent immigration status can have significant psychological impacts, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

It is important to note that the specific effects of immigration status on permanent residents will depend on the laws and policies of their country of residence, as well as their individual circumstances.
