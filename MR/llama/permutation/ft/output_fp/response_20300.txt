Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for ensuring that older adults from diverse backgrounds receive appropriate and effective care. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for over 90-year-old nominal Muslim people:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with older adults who may have limited English proficiency or who come from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Healthcare providers can use interpreters or translators to facilitate communication, but cultural competence also involves understanding nonverbal cues and body language.
2. Respect for cultural practices: Nominal Muslim older adults may have specific beliefs and practices related to health and illness. For example, they may prefer to avoid certain foods or practices that are considered haram (forbidden) under Islamic law. Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can respect and accommodate these preferences, leading to greater satisfaction and adherence to treatment plans.
3. Enhanced patient-provider trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they build trust with their patients. Older adults may be more likely to seek medical care and follow treatment recommendations when they feel comfortable with their healthcare providers. Trust is particularly important for older adults who may have complex health needs or experience cognitive decline.
4. Better management of chronic conditions: Nominal Muslim older adults may face unique challenges in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma due to their cultural beliefs and practices. Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can help these patients develop tailored treatment plans that take into account their religious beliefs and practices.
5. Increased adherence to medication regimens: Older adults who are culturally competent in their healthcare may be more likely to adhere to medication regimens due to a greater sense of ownership and control over their care. Healthcare providers can encourage older adults to take an active role in managing their health by providing education and support tailored to their cultural background.
6. Enhanced patient satisfaction: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they create a more positive patient experience. Older adults may feel more comfortable and relaxed
