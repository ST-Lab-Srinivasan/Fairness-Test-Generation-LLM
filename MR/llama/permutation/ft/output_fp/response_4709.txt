Ensuring the educational needs of Reservist Native recent immigrant students in the US can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help meet their unique needs. Here are some recommendations:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Reservist Native students may have different learning styles and cultural backgrounds than their non-Native peers. Cultural responsiveness involves incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into the classroom, acknowledging and valuing Indigenous cultures, and creating a safe and inclusive learning environment.
2. Bilingual education: Many Reservist Native students are fluent in their Indigenous language and may struggle with English as a second language. Providing bilingual education programs or supporting students in developing their language proficiency can help bridge this gap.
3. Access to technology: Ensuring that Reservist Native students have access to technology, such as laptops or tablets, can help them stay connected with their community and culture while also enhancing their academic experience.
4. Mentorship programs: Connecting Reservist Native students with mentors from their own communities can provide a sense of belonging and support, as well as offer guidance and encouragement throughout their academic journey.
5. Curriculum development: Developing curricula that incorporate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives can help Reservist Native students see themselves reflected in the material and feel more connected to their education.
6. Community partnerships: Collaborating with local Indigenous communities and organizations can provide Reservist Native students with opportunities for internships, job shadowing, and other experiential learning opportunities that can help them explore their career options and connect with their culture.
7. Support services: Providing support services such as academic advising, tutoring, and counseling can help Reservist Native students overcome barriers to success and stay motivated throughout their academic journey.
8. Parent and community engagement: Engaging parents and the broader community in the educational process can help build a stronger support network for Reservist Native students and encourage greater involvement in their education.
9. Identity-based learning: Creating learning environments that acknowledge and validate the identities of Reservist Native students can help them feel more comfortable and confident in their academic pursuits.
