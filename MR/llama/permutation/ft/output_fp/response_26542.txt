Highlighting the issues faced by deep-in-poverty recent immigrants to India can be a complex task, as it involves understanding the various factors that affect their well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways in which data can be used to highlight these issues:

1. Demographic analysis: Analyze the demographic characteristics of recent immigrants to India, such as age, gender, education level, occupation, and religion. This can help identify specific groups that may be facing more challenges than others. For example, a higher proportion of male migrants may be employed in low-skilled jobs, while female migrants may be more likely to face discrimination and marginalization.
2. Economic analysis: Analyze the economic data of recent immigrants, such as income levels, access to credit, and employment opportunities. This can help identify the extent to which they are able to integrate into the Indian economy and access basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. For example, a higher proportion of migrants may be living in poverty, with limited access to social protection and support networks.
3. Social exclusion analysis: Analyze data on social exclusion, such as access to education, healthcare, and other services. This can help identify the extent to which recent immigrants are facing discrimination and marginalization, particularly in accessing basic rights and services. For example, a higher proportion of migrant women may face gender-based discrimination, limiting their access to education and economic opportunities.
4. Housing analysis: Analyze data on the housing conditions of recent immigrants, such as access to affordable and safe housing, and the availability of slum settlements. This can help identify the extent to which they are able to access adequate housing, which is a basic human need. For example, a higher proportion of migrants may be living in overcrowded or substandard housing conditions, which can have negative impacts on their health and well-being.
5. Health analysis: Analyze data on the health outcomes of recent immigrants, such as access to healthcare services, disease prevalence, and mental health. This can help identify the extent to which they are able to access basic healthcare services, which is a fundamental right.
