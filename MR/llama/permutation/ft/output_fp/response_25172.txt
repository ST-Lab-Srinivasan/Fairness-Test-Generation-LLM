Ensuring that the healthcare needs of individuals with known genetic conditions are met is crucial for improving their quality of life and preventing complications. However, providing adequate healthcare for individuals with unknown or undiagnosed genetic conditions can be challenging due to several reasons:

1. Limited availability of genetic testing: Genetic testing is often expensive and may not be covered by insurance, making it inaccessible to many individuals, particularly those from low-income backgrounds.
2. Lack of awareness and education: Many people are not aware of the importance of genetic testing or do not understand how it works, which can hinder its adoption.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Individuals with genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
4. Limited availability of specialized care: Specialized care for individuals with genetic conditions may not be widely available or accessible, particularly in rural areas.
5. High cost of treatment: Treatment for genetic conditions can be expensive, which can be a barrier to accessing adequate care.
