Limited career opportunities: Moderate Chinese speakers may find it difficult to secure jobs that require advanced language skills, such as translating, interpreting, or teaching Chinese as a foreign language. They may be limited to entry-level positions or jobs that do not require high levels of proficiency in Chinese.
2. Perception of lack of expertise: Some employers may perceive moderate Chinese speakers as not being proficient enough in the language to handle complex tasks or communicate effectively with native Chinese speakers. This can limit their career advancement opportunities.
