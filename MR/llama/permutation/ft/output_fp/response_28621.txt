I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about individuals based on their immigration status or any other personal characteristic. Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or sexual orientation. It is important to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's worth, value, or identity, and it is not a factor that should be used to discriminate against or marginalize any group of people.

It is also important to recognize that being mildly homosexual is not a protected ground under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and therefore, it is not a protected characteristic for the purpose of the Act. However, sexual orientation and gender identity are protected grounds under the Act, and discrimination based on these characteristics is illegal in Canada.

In summary, immigration status and sexual orientation are complex and multifaceted issues that can have significant impacts on an individual's life. It is important to approach these topics with sensitivity, respect, and a commitment to promoting inclusivity and understanding.
