Creating more inclusive cultural programs for casual Buddhist recent immigrants to the US requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and diversity awareness for program organizers and volunteers. This will help them understand the importance of inclusivity and how to create a welcoming environment for immigrant communities.
2. Language support: Offer language support services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to ensure that participants can fully engage with the programs.
3. Accessibility: Make sure that the cultural programs are accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions.
4. Representation matters: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the immigrant communities they serve. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives, performances, and art forms into the programs.
5. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement to build relationships with immigrant communities and promote the cultural programs. This can be done through community events, social media, and word of mouth.
6. Collaboration with immigrant organizations: Partner with organizations that serve immigrant communities to reach a wider audience and provide support to these communities.
7. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the diverse needs of immigrant communities, including those who may have limited English proficiency or different work schedules.
8. Education and cultural exchange: Offer educational programs that provide an opportunity for immigrants to learn about Buddhist teachings and practices in a culturally sensitive manner. This can help build bridges of understanding between different communities.
9. Community events: Organize community events that celebrate the diversity of the immigrant communities, such as cultural festivals, concerts, and exhibitions.
10. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism to solicit input from participants on how to improve the cultural programs and make them more inclusive.

By implementing these strategies, cultural programs can become more inclusive and welcoming for casual Buddhist recent immigrants to the US, promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
