Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Spanish speakers, ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the perspectives of Native Spanish speakers and other underrepresented groups are included in the cultural program's planning and implementation. This can be achieved by involving members of these communities in the decision-making process or by consulting with community leaders and experts.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming environment where Native Spanish speakers feel valued and included. Encourage participation from all community members, and make sure that everyone feels comfortable and supported.
3. Provide culturally relevant programming: Offer cultural programs that are meaningful and relevant to the experiences and traditions of Native Spanish speakers. This can include events, workshops, or activities that highlight their cultural heritage and promote cross-cultural understanding.
4. Address language barriers: Provide translation services or bilingual programming to ensure that Native Spanish speakers can fully participate in the cultural program. This can involve providing interpretation services during events or offering bilingual materials and resources.
5. Build partnerships: Collaborate with community organizations and leaders to develop programs that are tailored to the needs and preferences of Native Spanish speakers. This can help build trust and support within the community, and ensure that the cultural program is more inclusive and effective.
6. Promote cross-cultural understanding: Develop educational materials and programming that promote cross-cultural understanding and respect. Encourage dialogue and collaboration between different ethnic groups, and provide opportunities for community members to learn from each other's traditions and experiences.
7. Involve the community in decision-making: Empower Native Spanish speakers and other underrepresented groups to take an active role in planning and implementing cultural programs. This can involve establishing advisory boards or committees that reflect the diversity of the community, and providing opportunities for community members to provide input and feedback.
8. Provide accessibility accommodations: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to all community members, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility
