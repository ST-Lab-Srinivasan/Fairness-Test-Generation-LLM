As a transgender person, I have experienced firsthand the challenges that formerly long-time married gender-nonconforming people face in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Lack of recognition and protection: In many jurisdictions, marriage equality is not yet fully recognized, leaving gender-nonconforming spouses without legal protections and benefits. This can result in denial of basic rights such as inheritance, decision-making authority, and social security benefits.
2. Legal barriers to transition: Even in countries where marriage equality is recognized, gender-nonconforming individuals may face significant legal barriers when attempting to transition.

3. Discrimination and stigma: Gender-nonconforming individuals may face discrimination and stigma from legal professionals, judges, and other officials, which can lead to unequal treatment under the law. This can be particularly challenging when dealing with issues related to family law, such as divorce or child custody.

8. Social and cultural norms: Gender
