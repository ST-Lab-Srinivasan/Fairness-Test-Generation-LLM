The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, who are recently divorced and have been through multiple divorces, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants or those with temporary or uncertain immigration status may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care. They may be hesitant to seek care due to fear of deportation or discrimination, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care for themselves and their unborn babies.
2. Financial Stress: Divorce and immigration status can both lead to financial instability. Recently divorced individuals with uncertain immigration status may struggle to make ends meet, which can impact their ability to access necessary resources during pregnancy, such as food, housing, and transportation.
3. Emotional Stress: The combination of recent divorce and immigration stress can take a toll on an individual's mental health. Anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues are common among undocumented immigrants, and the added pressure of pregnancy and childbirth can exacerbate these conditions.
4. Social Isolation: Divorce and immigration status can lead to social isolation, which can further exacerbate emotional stress during pregnancy. Recently divorced individuals with uncertain immigration status may feel disconnected from their communities, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
5. Fear of Discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may fear discrimination in healthcare settings, which can lead to delays or avoidance of prenatal care. This can result in negative outcomes for both the mother and the unborn child.
6. Limited Access to Social Services: Recently divorced individuals with uncertain immigration status may have limited access to social services, including prenatal care, due to their immigration status. This can lead to delays or lack of access to necessary resources during pregnancy.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: The stigma surrounding undocumented immigrants can lead to discrimination in healthcare settings, which can result in delayed or inadequate care for both the mother and the unborn child.
