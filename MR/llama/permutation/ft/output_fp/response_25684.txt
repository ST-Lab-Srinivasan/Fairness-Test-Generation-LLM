5. Limited understanding of local laws and regulations: Working professionals who are not familiar with the local legal system may find it challenging to understand their rights and responsibilities when it comes to accessing healthcare services.
6. Difficulty in navigating the billing and insurance process: Depending on their visa status, some working professionals may face difficulties in understanding how to pay for medical care or may encounter issues with billing and insurance claims.
