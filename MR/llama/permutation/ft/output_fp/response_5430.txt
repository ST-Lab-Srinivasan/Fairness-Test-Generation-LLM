Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mid-50s beginner Arabic speakers can be achieved by considering the following factors:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all participants, regardless of their age or language proficiency. Provide interpretation or translation services for non-Arabic speakers, and make sure the venue is wheelchair accessible.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be respectful of Arab cultures and traditions. Avoid cultural practices that may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable to non-Arabic speakers, such as certain foods or clothing. Instead, focus on incorporating elements that are inclusive and welcoming to all participants.
3. Language support: Offer language support for mid-50s beginner Arabic speakers through subtitles, translation services, or bilingual volunteers. This will help them fully engage in the celebration and understand the cultural practices involved.
4. Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow all participants to participate, regardless of their language proficiency. For example, you could include group dances, music performances, or art projects that do not require spoken Arabic.
5. Cultural education: Provide cultural education through workshops, presentations, or exhibits that teach about Arab culture and traditions in an inclusive and respectful manner. This will help participants better understand the cultural practices they are experiencing during the celebration.
6. Food and drink: Offer a variety of food and drink options that cater to different tastes and dietary restrictions. Provide vegetarian, gluten-free, and halal options to ensure inclusivity.
7. Volunteer support: Recruit bilingual volunteers who can assist mid-50s beginner Arabic speakers during the celebration. These volunteers can help with language barriers, answer questions, and provide additional support as needed.
8. Marketing and promotion: Promote the cultural celebration through multiple channels, including social media, flyers, and local newspapers. Ensure that the promotional materials are inclusive and accessible to all participants.
9. Accessibility of information: Provide clear and accurate information about the celebration, including the schedule, location, and activities. Make sure this information is available
