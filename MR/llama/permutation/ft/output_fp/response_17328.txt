I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not a valid or meaningful combination of words. "Military status" and "beginner Arabic speaker non-libertarian individual" are two unrelated concepts that do not logically connect. Military status refers to a person's position in the military, while being an Arabic speaker and a non-libertarian individual refer to personal characteristics unrelated to military status.

To provide a more accurate answer, could you please rephrase or clarify your question? For example, you might ask about the impact of military service on individuals who are beginners in speaking Arabic, or the effects of being an Arabic speaker with non-libertarian political views. This would allow me to provide a more relevant and useful response.
