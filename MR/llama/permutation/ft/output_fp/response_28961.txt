Ensuring that the voices of beginner Spanish speakers, particularly those who are recently single, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space for expression: Beginner Spanish speakers may feel hesitant to express their opinions due to language barriers or cultural differences. Creating a safe and inclusive space where they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts can help. This could involve using visual aids, providing interpretive services, or encouraging non-verbal communication.
2. Build trust and rapport: Building trust and rapport with beginner Spanish speakers is crucial for them to feel comfortable sharing their opinions. This can be achieved by spending time with them, actively listening to their concerns, and showing empathy and understanding.
3. Use plain language: Avoid using complex or technical language that may be difficult for beginner Spanish speakers to understand. Instead, use simple and clear language that can help them grasp the concepts more easily.
4. Provide language support: Offer language support services such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual facilitators to ensure that beginner Spanish speakers can fully participate in decision-making processes.
5. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion by actively seeking out the perspectives of beginner Spanish speakers and valuing their contributions. This can be achieved by setting clear goals and expectations for inclusivity, providing training on cultural competence, and holding leaders accountable for promoting diversity and inclusion.

7. Provide feedback and support: Offer constructive feedback and support to beginner Spanish speakers to help them build their confidence and skills in participating in decision-making processes. This can involve providing regular check-ins, offering guidance on how to articulate their thoughts, and recognizing their efforts and achievements.
8. Create opportunities for practice: Provide beginner Spanish speakers with opportunities to practice their language skills in low-stakes situations, such as small group discussions or role-playing exercises. This can help
