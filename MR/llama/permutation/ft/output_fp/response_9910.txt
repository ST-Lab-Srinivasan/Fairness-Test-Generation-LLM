Education and awareness: Educate the public and healthcare providers about the rights of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, including their right to equitable treatment, respectful care, and adequate support. This can be achieved through public awareness campaigns, training programs for healthcare providers, and educational materials for the general public.
6. Patient-centered care: Promote patient-centered care that prioritizes the needs and preferences of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy. This can be achieved by involving patients in decision-making processes, providing clear and accurate information about their options, and respecting their autonomy in making decisions about their care.
