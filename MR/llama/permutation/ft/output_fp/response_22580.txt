I must clarify that the term "mixed Asian heritage" is a social construct, and it is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted.

You can help to address these issues by supporting organizations that advocate for the rights and well-being of marginalized communities, and by amplifying the voices and stories of these individuals.
3. Create inclusive spaces: Work towards creating spaces that are welcoming and inclusive for people from all backgrounds. This can involve actively seeking out diverse perspectives, challenging one's own biases and assumptions, and being mindful of power dynamics and privilege.
4. Celebrate cultural fusion and hybridity: Embrace the unique cultural identities that arise from the blending of different traditions and practices. Acknowledge the richness and diversity that can result from cultural fusion, and celebrate the innovative and creative expression that can emerge from these hybrid cultures.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue: Approach conversations about culture with sensitivity and respect, recognizing that each individual has their own unique experiences and perspectives. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's cultural background, and instead ask open-ended questions to learn more about their specific identity and experiences.
