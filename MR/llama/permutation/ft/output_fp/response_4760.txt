6. Stigma associated with mental health: Mixed Hispanic individuals may face stigma associated with seeking mental health care, due to cultural beliefs or societal attitudes.
7. Limited availability of culturally sensitive mental health services: In some areas, there may be limited availability of mental health services that are culturally sensitive and responsive to the needs of mixed Hispanic individuals.
8. Limited access to healthcare services for undocumented individuals: Undocumented mixed Hispanic individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status.
9. Lack of representation in medical research: Mixed Hispanic individuals may be underrepresented in medical research, which can lead to a lack of understanding of their health needs and experiences.
