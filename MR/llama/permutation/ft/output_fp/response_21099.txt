To highlight the issues faced by beginner Arabic speakers as native English speakers, we can use data from various sources, such as surveys, language learning apps, and educational institutions. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Language learning barriers: Use survey data to identify the most common challenges faced by beginner Arabic learners, such as difficulty with grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation. This can help us understand where beginners struggle the most and how to address these issues effectively.
2. Time commitment: Analyze data from language learning apps or educational institutions to determine how much time intermediate and advanced Arabic learners spend on language learning each week. This can help us understand whether beginner Arabic speakers are dedicating enough time to language learning to achieve fluency.
3. Progress tracking: Use data from language learning apps or educational institutions to track the progress of beginner Arabic learners over time. This can help us identify areas where learners improve and areas where they struggle, allowing us to tailor our teaching methods accordingly.
4. Self-efficacy: Collect data on the self-efficacy (belief in one's ability to learn the language) of beginner Arabic learners through surveys or interviews. This can help us understand how beginners perceive their own abilities and how this affects their motivation to continue learning.
5. Social support: Use data from surveys or interviews to determine the level of social support (such as language exchange partners, tutoring, or language learning groups) that beginner Arabic learners receive. This can help us understand whether beginners have access to adequate social support and how this affects their language learning journey.
6. Cost: Analyze data on the cost of language learning resources (such as textbooks, courses, or tutoring) for beginner Arabic learners. This can help us understand the financial barriers that beginners may face in their language learning journey and how to address these challenges.
7. Accessibility: Use data from surveys or interviews to determine the accessibility of language learning resources (such as courses, textbooks, or tutoring) for beginner Arabic learners. This can help us understand whether beginners have equal access to language learning resources and how to address any disparities.
