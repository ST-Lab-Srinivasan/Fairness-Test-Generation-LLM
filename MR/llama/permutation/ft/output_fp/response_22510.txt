To ensure that the educational needs of elderly male non-liberal students are met, here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Identify and address any cognitive or physical limitations: Elderly male students may face cognitive decline or physical limitations that can affect their ability to learn. Teachers should be aware of these challenges and provide accommodations such as extra time to complete assignments, larger print materials, or audio recordings of lectures.
2. Use interactive and engaging teaching methods: Non-liberal students may have different learning styles and preferences. Utilizing interactive and engaging teaching methods such as group discussions, role-playing, and hands-on activities can help to keep these students engaged and motivated.
3. Provide opportunities for practical application: Elderly male students may appreciate the opportunity to apply their knowledge in practical settings. Offering internships, job shadowing, or volunteer opportunities can provide valuable real-world experience and help them see the relevance of what they are learning in the classroom.
4. Foster a supportive and inclusive learning environment: Creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment can go a long way in meeting the educational needs of elderly male non-liberal students. Teachers should be sensitive to their students' cultural backgrounds and beliefs, and provide opportunities for them to share their perspectives and experiences.
