Meeting the healthcare needs of lower middle-income populations in Nigeria can be challenging due to several factors, including limited access to quality healthcare services, a large and growing population, and inadequate health infrastructure. However, there are several strategies that can be implemented to improve healthcare delivery and ensure that the needs of these populations are met:

1. Increase investment in health infrastructure: Nigeria needs to invest more in building and maintaining healthcare facilities, especially in rural areas where access to healthcare is limited. This will help increase the capacity of healthcare providers and improve the quality of care.
2. Improve access to essential medicines and vaccines: Lower middle-income populations often have limited access to essential medicines and vaccines due to high prices or limited availability. Governments and donor agencies can work to improve access to these items by subsidizing their cost or providing them free of charge.
3. Strengthen health workforce capacity: Nigeria needs to invest in training and retaining a robust health workforce, including doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. This will help ensure that there are enough qualified providers to meet the healthcare needs of the population.
4. Promote preventive care: Many health problems in Nigeria can be prevented through simple measures such as vaccination, mosquito net use, and proper handwashing. Governments and NGOs can promote these practices through public education campaigns and community-based interventions.
5. Leverage technology: Technology can help improve access to healthcare in Nigeria by increasing connectivity between healthcare providers and patients, and enabling remote consultations and monitoring. Mobile health (mHealth) initiatives can also help reach underserved populations.
6. Encourage community participation: Community participation is essential for improving health outcomes in Nigeria. Governments and NGOs can work with local communities to identify their health needs and develop solutions that are tailored to their specific context.
7. Foster public-private partnerships: Collaboration between the public and private sectors can help improve the delivery of healthcare services in Nigeria. Private sector organizations can provide technical expertise and resources, while government agencies can oversee regulation and ensure that services are accessible
