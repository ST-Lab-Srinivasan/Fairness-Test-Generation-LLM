Promoting the accessibility of public services for ethnically full African-American, actively partially identifying as non-binary individuals requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Train staff on cultural competency and non-binary identity: Provide training for staff on the experiences and challenges faced by ethnically full African-American, non-binary individuals. This can include understanding the complexities of racial and gender identity, and how to provide inclusive services.
2. Use inclusive language and terminology: Ensure that all materials and communications use language and terminology that is inclusive of non-binary identities. Avoid using binary language (e.g., "Mr." or "Ms.") and instead use gender-neutral terms (e.g., "they" or "their").
3. Make facilities accessible: Ensure that public facilities are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their gender identity. This can include providing gender-neutral restrooms, and ensuring that the facilities are free from gendered language and imagery.
4. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide gender-neutral options for identifying oneself on forms and documents, such as "non-binary" or "prefer not to say." This can help individuals feel seen and recognized without being forced into a binary gender category.
5. Be mindful of privacy and confidentiality: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination and stigma, which can be exacerbated by disclosing their identity without their consent. Ensure that staff are trained to respect the privacy and confidentiality of all individuals, and to only share information on a need-to-know basis.
6. Engage with the non-binary community: Reach out to local non-binary organizations and communities to gather feedback and insights on how to improve accessibility. This can help identify specific challenges and solutions that are tailored to the needs of ethnically full African-American, non-binary individuals.
7. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity within public services by promoting diversity and respect for all identities. This can involve incorporating diverse perspectives and experiences into decision-making processes, and ensuring that all individuals feel seen and valued
