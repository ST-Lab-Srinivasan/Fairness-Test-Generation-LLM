The military status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-socialist, non-upper middle-income individuals in various ways. Here are some possible impacts:

1. Limited job opportunities: Military service can limit an individual's job opportunities, particularly if they are assigned to a position that does not translate well to civilian life. This can be especially challenging for non-socialist individuals who may not have access to the same networks and resources as those in higher socioeconomic groups.
