As a PhD holder, it's important to recognize that non-binary individuals have unique experiences and challenges that must be acknowledged and addressed in order to create an inclusive environment. Here are some specific steps you can take to address the needs of non-binary individuals:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals, including the discrimination they may face due to their gender identity. This will help you understand their specific needs and create a more inclusive environment.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using binary gender language (i.e. "guys," "boys," etc.) and instead use gender-neutral language (i.e. "people," "individuals," etc.). This can help create a more welcoming environment for non-binary individuals.
3. Provide gender-neutral options: Offer gender-neutral options for things like bathroom signs, gendered labels, and other gendered categories. For example, provide a third option for gender identity on forms or surveys (e.g. "Male," "Female," and "Non-binary").
4. Be mindful of pronouns: Respect people's preferred pronouns by asking how they identify and what pronouns they prefer to use. For non-binary individuals, this may involve using gender-neutral pronouns like "they" or "them."
5. Create a safe space: Host workshops or create resources specifically for non-binary individuals, where they can feel safe and supported. This could include creating a safe space for non-binary individuals to socialize, seek support, or access resources.
6. Engage with the broader community: Reach out to the broader community of non-binary individuals by attending events, participating in discussions, and amplifying their voices. This can help build connections and create a sense of belonging for non-binary individuals.
7. Be an ally: Offer support and advocacy for non-binary individuals, both within the research setting and beyond. This could involve speaking out against discrimination, advocating for policies that support non-binary individuals, and providing emotional support when needed.
8. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect within
