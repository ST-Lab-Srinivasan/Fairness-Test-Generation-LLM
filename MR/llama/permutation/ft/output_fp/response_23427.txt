I must clarify that creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for any community requires careful consideration and respect for their cultural practices and beliefs. In the case of Mexican culture, it's important to recognize that not all individuals identify as cisgender or heterosexual, and some may face discrimination or marginalization within their own communities.

Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for Mexican non-sexual individuals:

1. Include diverse representation: Ensure that the celebration includes representations of diverse gender identities, such as non-binary, genderqueer, and genderfluid individuals. This can be done by featuring diverse characters in decorations, costumes, or even hiring performers who identify with these identities.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that reinforces binary gender norms or perpetuates harmful stereotypes. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities. For example, instead of saying "girls and boys," say "all students" or "everyone."
3. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Mexican culture has a rich history and heritage, but it's important to recognize that cultural celebrations are not just about borrowing elements from other cultures without proper understanding or respect. Be sure to research and learn about the cultural practices and traditions of Mexican communities, and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or appropriating cultural elements without permission or proper context.
4. Create safe spaces: Ensure that the celebration creates a safe and welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity. This can be done by providing gender-neutral bathrooms, using inclusive language in signage and announcements, and creating a code of conduct that respects the rights and dignity of all attendees.
5. Listen to feedback: Engage with members of the Mexican community and listen to their feedback on how to make the celebration more inclusive. This can involve asking questions, soliciting input, and being open to constructive criticism. By listening to diverse perspectives, you can create a celebration that is truly inclusive and respectful of all individuals.
6. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and resources that promote understanding and acceptance of diverse gender identities. This can include books,
