Addressing the needs of non-able-bodied immigrant individuals in disaster response requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

Inclusive Communication: Develop communication materials and programs that cater to the diverse language needs of immigrant communities, including braille, sign language, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals. Ensure that all communication channels are accessible and easy to understand.
