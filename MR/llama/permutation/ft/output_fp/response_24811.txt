The impact of immigration status on the lives of average earners can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. This can lead to delayed or foregone medical care, which can have serious consequences for their overall health and well-being.
2. Employment opportunities: Immigrants may face discrimination in the workplace, including being passed over for promotions or facing harassment. They may also be subject to unfair wages or working conditions.
3. Education: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges in accessing education due to their immigration status. This can limit their opportunities for personal and professional growth.
4. Housing: Immigrants may face discrimination when renting or buying housing, which can limit their access to safe and affordable housing.
5. Criminal justice system: Immigrants may be at risk of detention and deportation if they come into contact with the criminal justice system, even for minor offenses.
6. Family separation: Immigrants who are undocumented or have temporary status may face separation from their families, including spouses and children, due to immigration laws that prioritize the reunification of families.
7. Mental health: The stress of living in a constant state of uncertainty due to immigration status can have serious mental health consequences, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
8. Economic security: Immigrants may face economic insecurity due to their immigration status, which can limit their access to financial resources and opportunities for economic mobility.
9. Social isolation: Immigrants may experience social isolation due to language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
10. Lack of representation: Immigrants may face barriers in accessing legal representation due to their immigration status, which can limit their ability to advocate for themselves and navigate the immigration system.

It's important to note that these impacts can vary depending on individual circumstances, including the specific immigration status of the person, their country of origin
