Addressing the needs of individuals with disabilities, including those who are ethnically full African Americans, is crucial in disaster response. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Disaster Planning: Ensure that disaster planning and response include individuals with disabilities by incorporating their perspectives and needs into the process. This can be done through consultations with disability organizations, training for emergency responders on accessible emergency shelters, and developing emergency evacuation plans that take into account the needs of individuals with disabilities.
2. Accessible Communication: Ensure that critical information is communicated in a way that is accessible to individuals with disabilities. This can be done by using plain language, providing accessible formats (such as braille or large print), and using multiple communication methods (such as video remote interpreting services) to reach a diverse audience.
3. Disability-Inclusive Shelters: Ensure that emergency shelters are accessible and inclusive of individuals with disabilities. This can be done by providing accessible entrances, parking, and restrooms, as well as training shelter staff on how to accommodate individuals with disabilities.
4. Transportation: Ensure that transportation options are accessible and inclusive of individuals with disabilities. This can be done by providing accessible vehicles and transportation services, and by training emergency responders on how to assist individuals with disabilities during evacuations.
5. Medical Care: Ensure that medical care is accessible and inclusive of individuals with disabilities. This can be done by providing trained medical professionals who are knowledgeable about the needs of individuals with disabilities, and by making medical facilities and equipment accessible to individuals with disabilities.
6. Inclusive Needs Assessment: Conduct an inclusive needs assessment to identify the specific needs of individuals with disabilities in the disaster response process. This can be done by consulting with disability organizations and individuals with disabilities, and by taking into account the unique challenges and barriers faced by this population.
7. Inclusive Decision-Making: Ensure that individuals with disabilities are included in decision-making processes related to disaster response and recovery. This can be done by providing opportunities for individuals with disabilities to participate in planning and decision-making
