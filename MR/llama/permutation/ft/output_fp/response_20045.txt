Addressing the specific needs of immigrant students in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies to address the specific needs of immigrant recent immigrants to the US:

This training can help educators recognize the challenges immigrant students face in the academic environment and develop strategies to support their success.

These services can help immigrant students improve their language proficiency, which is essential for academic success.

This can help build relationships between immigrant students and their peers, which is essential for a successful academic experience.
