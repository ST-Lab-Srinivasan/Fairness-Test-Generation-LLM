Supporting the community engagement of lower-class permanent resident individuals is crucial for building a more inclusive and equitable society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide access to education and job training: Lower-class permanent residents may face barriers to accessing quality education and job training opportunities. Governments and organizations can provide financial support, mentorship, and training programs to help them acquire the skills they need to succeed in the workforce.
2. Address language barriers: Many lower-class permanent residents may face language barriers that prevent them from fully participating in their communities. Providing language classes, interpreters, and bilingual services can help bridge this gap.
3. Encourage civic participation: Lower-class permanent residents may feel disconnected from the political process and community decision-making. Governments and organizations can encourage civic participation through voter registration drives, community forums, and other initiatives that promote citizen engagement.
4. Foster social connections: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for lower-class permanent residents. Community events, volunteer opportunities, and social gatherings can help build connections and foster a sense of belonging.
5. Advocate for policy change: Governments can implement policies that address the systemic barriers facing lower-class permanent residents, such as inadequate housing, insecure employment, and limited access to healthcare. Advocacy groups can also push for policy changes at the local, provincial, or federal level.
6. Support community-based initiatives: Community-based initiatives, such as cooperatives, mutual aid societies, and volunteer networks, can provide lower-class permanent residents with a platform to organize and advocate for their needs. Governments and organizations can support these initiatives through funding, technical assistance, and other forms of support.

8. Promote cultural expression: Lower-class permanent residents may face barriers to expressing their cultural identity due to systemic racism or xenophobia. Governments
