As a freedom advocate and a Native natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that I have faced in the healthcare system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Limited access to care: Many Native American reservations lack access to quality healthcare due to geographical barriers, lack of transportation, and limited resources. This can result in delayed or inadequate medical treatment, which can have serious consequences for patients' health.
2. Cultural barriers: The healthcare system often does not take into account the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities. For example, some traditional healers may be hesitant to seek medical attention from a Western-trained provider due to cultural beliefs or fear of losing their traditional healing practices.
