Supporting the social inclusion of natural-born Indian citizens aged over 90 years old (or over 85) requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Healthcare and Wellness: Ensure access to quality healthcare and wellness services, including preventive care, diagnostic tests, and medical interventions. This can be done through partnerships with healthcare providers, community clinics, or government-run hospitals.
2. Social Activities: Organize social activities, such as group exercises, art classes, music therapy, or cultural events, to encourage social interaction and mental stimulation. These activities can help combat loneliness, isolation, and cognitive decline.
3. Transportation Services: Provide transportation services to facilitate their participation in community events, social gatherings, or medical appointments. This can be done through partnerships with local transportation providers or by establishing a dedicated transportation service for seniors.
4. Financial Inclusion: Ensure access to financial services, such as bank accounts, money transfer, and bill payment assistance. This can help them manage their finances and stay connected with family and friends.
5. Legal Support: Provide legal support and advice on matters related to senior citizens, such as wills, power of attorney, and elder abuse prevention. This can help ensure their rights are protected and they have access to the necessary resources.
6. Housing Support: Offer support with housing-related issues, such as finding affordable housing options, applying for government assistance programs, or connecting them with local organizations that provide home repair services.
7. Technology Training: Provide training on using technology, such as smartphones, tablets, or computers, to help them stay connected with their loved ones and access important resources.
8. Community Outreach: Organize community outreach programs to connect seniors with local organizations and resources that can provide additional support. This can include partnering with senior centers, community colleges, or non-profit organizations that specialize in supporting seniors.
9. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote the well-being of seniors, such as age-friendly initiatives
