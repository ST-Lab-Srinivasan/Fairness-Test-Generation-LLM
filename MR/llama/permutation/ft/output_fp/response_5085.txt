Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Nigerian people living in poverty are met is a complex and multi-faceted challenge. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to primary healthcare services: Many Nigerians, especially those living in rural areas, lack access to basic healthcare services such as vaccinations, antenatal care, and malaria treatment. Investing in infrastructure, training more health workers, and deploying mobile clinics can help increase access to primary healthcare services.
2. Improve the quality of secondary and tertiary care: While many Nigerians have limited access to primary healthcare, those who do have access may still face challenges in accessing higher levels of care due to a lack of specialist facilities or qualified health workers. Investing in specialist hospitals and training more health workers can help improve the quality of secondary and tertiary care.
3. Address financial barriers: Many Nigerians are unable to afford healthcare services, especially those living in poverty. Implementing a universal health coverage (UHC) scheme or other financing mechanisms can help address financial barriers and ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare regardless of their ability to pay.
4. Promote preventive care: Many health problems in Nigeria are caused by preventable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Investing in preventive care can help reduce the burden on the healthcare system and improve overall health outcomes.
5. Address social determinants of health: Poverty and other social determinants of health can have a significant impact on health outcomes. Addressing issues such as poor housing, inadequate nutrition, and lack of access to clean water can help improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs in the long term.
6. Build partnerships between government, NGOs, and private sector: Collaboration between different stakeholders is crucial for addressing the complex challenges facing Nigeria's healthcare system. Governments, NGOs, and private sector actors can work together to pool resources, share expertise, and leverage each other's strengths to improve healthcare outcomes.
7. Invest in technology: Technology
