Creating more inclusive social policies for elderly widows or widowers who are undocumented immigrants can be a complex and challenging task. Here are some potential strategies that could be considered:

1. Advocate for policy changes: Work with advocacy groups and community organizations to push for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels. This could include advocating for policies that provide support for elderly undocumented immigrants, such as access to healthcare, housing, and other social services.
2. Provide legal support: Many elderly undocumented immigrants may be eligible for legal assistance programs, such as legal aid organizations or pro bono legal clinics. These organizations can provide free or low-cost legal advice and representation to help individuals navigate the complex immigration system.
3. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Many social service providers and healthcare professionals may not be familiar with the specific needs and cultural practices of elderly undocumented immigrants. Providing cultural sensitivity training can help ensure that these individuals receive respectful and appropriate care.
4. Develop language access services: Many elderly undocumented immigrants may have limited English proficiency, which can create barriers to accessing healthcare and other social services. Providing language access services, such as interpreters or translated materials, can help ensure that these individuals receive the support they need.
5. Address systemic issues: Elderly undocumented immigrants may face systemic issues, such as discrimination or lack of access to healthcare, that can make it difficult for them to access social services. Addressing these issues through policy changes and community organizing can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for this population.
6. Build partnerships: Collaborating with other organizations and community groups can help identify and address the specific needs of elderly undocumented immigrants. This could include partnering with cultural organizations, community centers, or religious groups to reach this population.
7. Conduct outreach and education: Many elderly undocumented immigrants may be unaware of the resources available to them or may face barriers to accessing these resources due to lack of information. Conducting outreach and education efforts can help raise awareness about the services available and how to access them.
