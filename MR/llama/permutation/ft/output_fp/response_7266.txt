As a beginner Chinese speaker, there can be several challenges that a native natural-born US citizen may face in the legal system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge faced by beginner Chinese speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be complex, and understanding them can be difficult for those who are not fluent in Chinese. This can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and missed opportunities to advocate for oneself or one's clients.
