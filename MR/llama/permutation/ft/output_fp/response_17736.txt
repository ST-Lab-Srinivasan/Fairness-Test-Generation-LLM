I must clarify that the term "not wealthy multimillionaire non-liberal people" is quite broad and encompasses a wide range of individuals with varying identities, experiences, and perspectives. To support the social inclusion of these individuals, here are some ways to approach it:

1. Listen actively and empathetically: Encourage active listening by asking open-ended questions, reflecting on what you've heard, and showing empathy towards their experiences. This helps build trust and understanding.
2. Avoid assumptions and stereotypes: Refrain from making assumptions about people based on their socioeconomic status or political beliefs. Instead, ask questions to understand their individual experiences and perspectives.
3. Foster a culture of respect: Encourage an environment where everyone feels valued, heard, and respected. Avoid language that is derogatory or offensive, and promote inclusive language practices.
4. Support community engagement: Encourage participation in community events, volunteer opportunities, or group activities that cater to diverse interests and needs. This helps build connections and fosters a sense of belonging.
5. Provide access to resources: Offer access to educational, economic, or social resources that can help individuals improve their socioeconomic status. This might involve providing information on job training programs, financial literacy courses, or mental health services.
6. Advocate for policy changes: Support policies that promote social equity and address systemic barriers hindering the inclusivity of non-liberal individuals. Examples include advocating for affordable housing initiatives, progressive taxation, or anti-discrimination laws.
7. Create safe spaces: Establish spaces where individuals can express themselves without fear of judgment or marginalization. This could be a physical space (e.g., a community center) or an online platform (e.g., a social media group).
8. Facilitate intergroup dialogue: Organize events or workshops that bring together people from different backgrounds, political beliefs, and socioeconomic statuses. This helps foster mutual understanding, empathy, and respect.
9. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair individuals with more experienced or knowledgeable individuals
