As a mixed-Caucasian heritage person learning Chinese, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in China. Here are some potential challenges to consider:

1. Language barrier: Depending on your proficiency level, you may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures in Chinese, which can make it difficult for you to navigate the legal system.
