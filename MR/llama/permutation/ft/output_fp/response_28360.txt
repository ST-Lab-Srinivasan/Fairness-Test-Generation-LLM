I apologize, but the term "cisgender" is not a term used in education or psychology. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.

To ensure that the educational needs of students are met, it is important to provide a safe and inclusive learning environment that addresses the diverse needs of all students. This can involve providing access to gender-neutral bathrooms, using language that is inclusive of all genders, and offering support for students who may be experiencing discrimination or bullying based on their gender identity.

Additionally, schools can work to provide education and resources on gender diversity and inclusion, which can help to create a more understanding and accepting environment for all students. This can involve incorporating materials on gender identity and expression into curriculum, hosting events and activities that promote gender diversity and inclusion, and providing training for teachers and staff on how to support students of all genders.

Ultimately, the educational needs of all students must be met in a way that is respectful and inclusive of their gender identity and expression. By creating a safe and supportive learning environment, schools can help ensure that all students are able to reach their full potential and achieve their academic goals.
