Creating more inclusive housing policies for trans non-sexual individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge and validate the experiences of trans individuals: Housing policies should recognize the specific challenges faced by trans individuals, such as discrimination, stigma, and marginalization. Policies should aim to create a welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.
2. Use inclusive language: Housing policies should use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary terms like "men" and "women," which can exclude non-binary and genderqueer individuals. Instead, use language like "individuals," "people," or "residents."
3. Accommodate diverse gender expressions: Housing policies should recognize that gender expression is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity. Policies should accommodate a range of gender expressions, including those that may not conform to traditional binary gender norms.
4. Provide gender-neutral housing options: Many trans individuals face discrimination when seeking housing that aligns with their gender identity. Housing policies should provide gender-neutral housing options, such as single-occupancy rooms or apartments, that can be occupied by anyone regardless of their gender identity.
5. Offer support services: Trans individuals often face unique challenges in accessing healthcare and other support services. Housing policies should provide access to support services, such as counseling, mental health resources, and case management, that are tailored to the specific needs of trans individuals.
6. Engage with the trans community: Housing policies should be developed in partnership with the trans community, through ongoing consultation and engagement. This will ensure that policies reflect the unique needs and experiences of trans individuals and are more likely to be successful in addressing the challenges they face.
7. Address systemic barriers: Housing policies should address systemic barriers that prevent trans individuals from accessing affordable and safe housing. This may involve working with government agencies, community organizations, and other stakeholders to address issues such as discrimination, poverty, and lack of access to healthcare.
