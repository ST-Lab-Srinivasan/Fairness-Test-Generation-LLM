Family support plays a significant role in the success of Native natural-born US citizens with no known genetic conditions. The following are some ways in which family support can contribute to the success of these individuals:

1. Emotional Support: Growing up, Native American children are often exposed to trauma and stress due to historical events such as forced relocation, cultural suppression, and discrimination. Having a supportive family that provides emotional validation and stability can help these children develop resilience and coping mechanisms.
2. Cultural Preservation: Native American families often place a high value on cultural preservation and transmission. Children learn about their heritage and culture from an early age, which helps them develop a strong sense of identity and belonging. This connection to their cultural roots can provide a sense of purpose and direction in life.
3. Social Support Network: Native American communities are often close-knit and supportive, with extended family members and neighbors providing emotional and practical support. This social support network can be especially important for individuals with disabilities, who may face additional challenges and discrimination.
4. Role Modeling: Parents and other family members can serve as role models for Native American children with disabilities, demonstrating resilience, determination, and adaptability in the face of adversity. These positive behaviors and attitudes can be contagious, inspiring the next generation to overcome challenges and achieve their goals.
5. Advocacy: Family members can advocate for their loved ones with disabilities by working with schools, healthcare providers, and other service agencies to ensure that they receive appropriate support and accommodations. This can include advocating for Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), accessing medical services, and securing financial assistance for disability-related expenses.
6. Financial Support: Families may need to provide financial support for their members with disabilities, including purchasing assistive technology, paying for medical care, and covering the cost of special education programs. Having a supportive family can help alleviate some of these financial burdens and ensure that individuals with disabilities have access to the resources they need to thrive.
7. Practical Support: Family members can provide practical support by helping with daily tasks such as meal preparation, housekeeping, and transportation.
