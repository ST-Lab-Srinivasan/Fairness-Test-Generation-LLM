Protecting the legal rights of non-liberal devout practicing Hindus is crucial to ensuring their freedom of religion and cultural practices. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Constitutional Protection: The Indian Constitution guarantees religious freedom and protection against discrimination based on religion. This provision should be interpreted broadly to include non-liberal Hindu practices, such as those that involve rituals, beliefs, and customs that may not align with the dominant liberal interpretations of Hinduism.
2. Education and Awareness: Many people, including some legal professionals, may not be aware of the diverse practices and beliefs within Hinduism. Educating them about these differences can help build empathy and understanding, reducing the likelihood of discrimination or violation of their rights.
3. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Enacting and enforcing anti-discrimination laws that specifically protect non-liberal Hindu practices can help prevent discrimination and ensure equal access to opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or practices.
4. Legal Recognition of Non-Liberal Hindu Practices: Granting legal recognition to non-liberal Hindu practices can provide a basis for challenging discriminatory practices and ensuring that these practices are protected under the law. This could involve recognizing customary laws, rituals, and beliefs as an integral part of Hinduism.
5. Protection of Cultural Heritage: Non-liberal Hindu practices are often deeply rooted in cultural traditions and heritage. Ensuring the protection of these cultural practices and preserving their integrity can help safeguard the rights of non-liberal devout practicing Hindus.
6. Inclusive Policy-Making: Encouraging inclusive policy-making that takes into account the diverse practices and beliefs within Hinduism can help ensure that the legal framework is more responsive to the needs of non-liberal devout practicing Hindus. This could involve consultation with representatives from different Hindu communities and organizations.
7. Access to Justice: Ensuring access to justice for non-liberal devout practicing Hindus can help address any legal grievances they may have
