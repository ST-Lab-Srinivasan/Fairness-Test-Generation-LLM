This includes understanding the cultural practices, values, and beliefs of ethnically full Hispanics and how they may impact their experiences during a disaster.

Provide accessible amenities such as ramps, elevators, and adaptive equipment, as well as auxiliary aids and services for individuals with disabilities.
5. Inclusive Disaster Planning: Develop disaster plans that take into account the needs of ethnically full Hispanic communities. This includes identifying potential hazards and risks specific to their communities, developing tailored response strategies, and incorporating cultural considerations into emergency preparedness efforts.
6. Community-Led Response: Involve ethnically full Hispanic communities in disaster response efforts through community-led initiatives. This can help ensure that response efforts are culturally appropriate, sensitive to community needs, and tailored to the unique experiences of ethnically full Hispanics.
