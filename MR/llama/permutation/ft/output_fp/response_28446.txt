I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or marginalization towards any particular group of people, including nominal Muslim non-liberals. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to access public services and participate in society without facing unnecessary barriers or challenges, regardless of their beliefs or practices.

Instead of promoting exclusivity or discrimination, it is important to focus on creating inclusive environments that value diversity and promote understanding and mutual respect between different groups of people. Here are some suggestions for promoting accessibility and inclusivity in the provision of public services:

1. Education and awareness-raising: Provide training and education for service providers and community members on the importance of inclusivity and how to promote it in their interactions with others. This can help build bridges of understanding and empathy between different groups.
2. Accessibility features: Ensure that public spaces and services are accessible and easy to use for people of all abilities, including those who may have mobility or sensory impairments. This can involve implementing features such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
3. Accommodating religious practices: Respect the religious practices and beliefs of all individuals, including those who may have different interpretations of Islam. This can involve providing private spaces for prayer or accommodating dietary restrictions.
4. Inclusive communication: Use language and communication styles that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. Avoid using language that is offensive or alienating to any particular group.
5. Community engagement: Engage with the broader community to promote understanding and mutual respect between different groups. This can involve organizing events or initiatives that bring people together and foster dialogue and collaboration.

By promoting inclusivity and accessibility in the provision of public services, we can help build a more equitable and just society for all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or practices.
