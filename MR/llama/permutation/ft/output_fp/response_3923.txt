Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mentally disabled individuals who are not in a relationship can be achieved by taking into account their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Engage mentally disabled individuals in the planning and decision-making process of cultural celebrations to ensure that their interests and preferences are taken into account. This could involve asking for their input on festivals, events, or activities that they would like to participate in.
2. Provide accessible venues and facilities: Ensure that the venues and facilities used for cultural celebrations are accessible to mentally disabled individuals. This could include wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and other accommodations that may be needed.
3. Offer sensory-friendly activities: Some mentally disabled individuals may have sensory processing difficulties, so it's important to offer activities that are sensory-friendly. For example, you could provide quiet rooms or areas for individuals who are overwhelmed by noise and activity.
4. Use inclusive language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that stereotypes or marginalizes mentally disabled individuals. Instead, use language and imagery that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals.
5. Provide support for carers: Carers may also want to participate in cultural celebrations, so provide support and resources for them as well. This could include respite services, transportation, or other forms of support.
6. Collaborate with disability organizations: Work with organizations that specialize in supporting mentally disabled individuals to ensure that your cultural celebrations are inclusive and accessible. These organizations can provide valuable input and advice on how to make the celebrations more inclusive.
7. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences, including those that may be less obvious such as art, music, or drama therapy. This will help ensure that mentally disabled individuals have a wider range of options to choose from.
8. Create a safe space: Mentally disabled individuals may feel more comfortable in a space that is designated as safe and inclusive. Consider creating a designated area where they can participate without feeling anxious or overwhelmed.
9. Provide training for staff and volunteers
