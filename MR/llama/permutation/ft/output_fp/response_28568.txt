Promoting the financial stability of individuals with non-known genetic conditions who belong to the non-lower class can be challenging, as it requires addressing the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to health disparities. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented:

1. Increase access to affordable healthcare: Individuals with unknown genetic conditions may face significant medical expenses, including copays, deductibles, and coinsurance.
