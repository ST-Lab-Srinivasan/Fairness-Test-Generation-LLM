Creating more inclusive social policies for casual Buddhist individuals in their late 30s requires understanding their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions:

1. Flexibility: Offer flexible policies that cater to the diverse schedules and lifestyles of this age group. For example, provide online or hybrid courses that can be attended at any time, or offer prayer sessions during non-peak hours when they may have more time available.
2. Accessibility: Make Buddhist teachings and practices more accessible to this age group. This could involve using technology such as virtual reality or augmented reality to create immersive experiences, or offering free or low-cost resources such as eBooks, audio recordings, or apps.
3. Intergenerational connections: Encourage intergenerational connections by hosting events or programs that bring together individuals of different ages. This can help foster a sense of community and support among Buddhists in their late 30s, as well as provide opportunities for mentorship and learning from older or younger members.
4. Career and family support: Provide resources and support for Buddhists in their late 30s who may be balancing work and family responsibilities. This could involve offering childcare services or flexible scheduling options during meditation sessions, or providing career counseling and job placement assistance.
5. Community service opportunities: Offer community service opportunities that align with the values of Buddhism and are accessible to individuals in their late 30s. This could involve organizing group volunteer events or providing individual volunteer opportunities that can be easily incorporated into their schedules.
6. Personalized support: Offer personalized support and guidance tailored to the unique needs and goals of Buddhists in their late 30s. This could involve one-on-one mentorship or counseling sessions, or providing access to experienced Buddhist teachers who can offer guidance and support.
7. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language and practices that acknowledge the diversity of beliefs and experiences within the Buddhist community. For example, use gender-neutral language and avoid assumptions about individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
8. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds and traditions of Buddh
