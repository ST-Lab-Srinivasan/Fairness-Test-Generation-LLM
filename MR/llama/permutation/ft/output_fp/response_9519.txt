Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for natural-born US citizen mentally disabled individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite individuals with mental disabilities to participate in the planning of cultural celebrations. This will help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that they feel included.
2. Provide accommodations: Make sure that the celebration venue and activities are accessible to people with mental disabilities. This may include providing wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpreters, or assistive listening devices.
3. Offer sensory-friendly activities: Many cultural celebrations can be overwhelming for individuals with mental disabilities due to loud noises, crowded spaces, and bright lights. Offer sensory-friendly activities such as quiet rooms, fidget toys, or weighted blankets to help them cope with these stimuli.

5. Highlight diverse perspectives: Include a variety of voices and perspectives in the planning process to ensure that the cultural celebration reflects the experiences and culture of individuals with mental disabilities.
6. Create a safe space: Provide a safe and welcoming environment for individuals with mental disabilities to participate in the cultural celebration without fear of stigma or discrimination.
7. Offer support: Provide support and resources to individuals with mental disabilities who may need additional help during the celebration, such as extra time to complete activities or a quiet space to retreat to if needed.
8. Encourage participation: Encourage individuals with mental disabilities to participate in the cultural celebration by offering activities that are tailored to their interests and abilities.
9. Provide education and awareness: Educate the community about mental disabilities and the importance of inclusion. This can help dispel stigmas and promote greater understanding and acceptance.
