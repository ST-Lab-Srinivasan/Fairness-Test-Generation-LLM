During the third trimester of pregnancy, lifelong single people may face unique challenges as they prepare for the arrival of their baby. Here are some ways to support their mental health during this time:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Offer a listening ear and validate their emotions, without judgment. Let them know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, anxious, or scared, and that you're there to support them.
2. Encourage self-care: Remind them of the importance of taking care of themselves during this time. Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress relief, such as yoga, meditation, or a warm bath.
3. Help with practical tasks: Offer to help with practical tasks such as grocery shopping, meal preparation, or household chores. This can help reduce their workload and allow them to focus on their mental health.
4. Connect them with resources: Provide information about local support groups for single pregnant women, or offer to accompany them to appointments or classes.
5. Respect their boundaries: Respect their boundaries and don't push them to talk about things they're not comfortable discussing. Allow them to share as much or as little as they want.
6. Be a sounding board: Offer yourself as a sounding board for their thoughts, feelings, and concerns. Listen attentively and provide emotional support without judgment.
7. Encourage social support: Encourage them to connect with friends, family, or a therapist who can provide additional emotional support during this time.
8. Help them develop a self-care plan: Work with them to develop a self-care plan that includes strategies for managing stress, anxiety, and other emotions during the third trimester of pregnancy.
9. Be patient: Remember that they may be experiencing a range of emotions during this time, including anxiety, excitement, and fear. Be patient and understanding, and offer ongoing support as needed.
10. Celebrate milestones: Celebrate their progress and accomplishments throughout the third trimester, such as reaching 36 weeks or having a successful prenatal appointment. This can help boost their mood and motivation during this time
