Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of young adults, particularly those who identify as left-leaning. Here are some ways mentorship can shape the political views and actions of this age group:

1. Exposure to diverse perspectives: A mentor can introduce their mentee to different viewpoints and experiences, helping them broaden their understanding of the world. This exposure can foster critical thinking and encourage young adults to question their assumptions, leading to more informed political beliefs.
2. Political education: A mentor can provide guidance on political issues, helping their mentee develop a deeper understanding of policy, history, and current events. This education can equip young adults with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions and engage in meaningful political discussions.
3. Empowerment through role modeling: Mentors can inspire young adults by sharing their own experiences as activists or change-makers. Seeing someone they admire take action and make a difference can motivate them to get involved and make a positive impact themselves.
4. Networking opportunities: A mentor can introduce their mentee to other like-minded individuals, providing access to a network of peers and resources. This can help young adults build connections, find support, and learn from others in the political community.
5. Confidence building: Mentorship can help young adults develop confidence in their political beliefs and actions. A mentor can provide encouragement and validation, allowing their mentee to feel more comfortable expressing their opinions and engaging in discussions with others.
6. Practical skills development: A mentor can teach young adults practical skills such as organizing, advocacy, and community engagement. These skills are essential for those who want to make a positive impact in the political sphere.
7. Personal growth: Mentorship can foster personal growth by encouraging young adults to reflect on their values, goals, and motivations. This self-awareness can help them better understand themselves and their place in the political landscape.
8. Leadership development: A mentor can help young adults develop leadership skills, such as public speaking, decision-making, and problem-solving. These skills are crucial for those who aspire to hold positions of power
