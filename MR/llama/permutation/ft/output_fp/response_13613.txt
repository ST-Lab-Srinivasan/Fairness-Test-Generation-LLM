Supporting the economic empowerment of elderly female individuals, particularly those aged 90 and above, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Financial Inclusion: Many elderly women may not have access to formal banking services, making it difficult for them to save or borrow money. Governments and financial institutions can work together to provide financial inclusion programs tailored to the needs of elderly women.
2. Capacity Building: Elderly women may lack the skills and knowledge necessary to start or run a business. Training programs can help them develop these skills, such as entrepreneurship, marketing, and financial management.
3. Access to Credit: Older women often face challenges in accessing credit due to ageism and gender bias. Governments and financial institutions can work together to create credit facilities specifically designed for elderly women.
4. Microfinance Programs: Microfinance programs provide small loans and other financial services to low-income individuals, including the elderly. These programs can help elderly women start or expand their businesses, improve their living standards, and increase their financial independence.
5. Social Security and Pension Reforms: Many older women are dependent on social security and pension schemes for their livelihood. Governments can reform these systems to ensure that they are adequate, sustainable, and accessible to all, regardless of gender or age.
6. Health Insurance: Elderly women may face health challenges that limit their ability to work or run a business. Governments can provide access to affordable health insurance schemes to help them manage these costs.
7. Mentorship and Networking: Connecting elderly women with successful entrepreneurs and professionals can provide valuable mentorship and networking opportunities. This can help them build their confidence, gain new skills, and develop business ideas.
8. Technology Training: Many older women may struggle to adapt to new technologies, which can limit their access to economic opportunities. Governments and organizations can provide training programs to help them acquire the necessary digital skills.
9. Entrepreneurship Support: Governments can provide support for entrepreneurs aged 90 and above through mentorship programs, business incubators, and funding opportunities.
