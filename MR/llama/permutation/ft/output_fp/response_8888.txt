Ensuring the financial needs of young adult Native American recent immigrants to the US can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to help them:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many Native American communities lack access to traditional banking services, making it difficult for young adults to open bank accounts, apply for loans, or invest in their future. Community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and microfinance organizations can provide alternative financial services to these communities.
