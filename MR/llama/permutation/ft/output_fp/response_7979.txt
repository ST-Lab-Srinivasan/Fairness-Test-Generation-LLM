Acknowledge the intersectionality of aging and sexuality: Recognize that LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly those in their mid-50s, face unique challenges related to aging, such as health issues, social isolation, and discrimination. Address these intersections by developing policies that address the specific needs of older LGBTQ+ individuals.
2. Improve access to healthcare: Ensure that older LGBTQ+ individuals have access to quality, affirming healthcare services that meet their specific needs. This includes providing education and training for healthcare providers on LGBTQ+ issues and providing age-appropriate care that addresses the physical and mental health challenges of aging.

4. Address financial security: Many older LGBTQ+ individuals may face economic insecurity due to a lack of access to retirement savings or other financial resources. Develop policies that provide financial support and resources, such as retirement savings plans or financial assistance programs, to help older LGBTQ+ individuals achieve financial stability.
