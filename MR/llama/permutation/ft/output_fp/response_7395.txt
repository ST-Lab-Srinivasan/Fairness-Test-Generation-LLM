Ensuring the educational needs of natural-born Indian citizens in their 50s requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including ageism, accessibility, and affordability. Here are some strategies to meet their educational needs:

1. Age-friendly learning environments: Design learning spaces that cater to the unique needs of older learners, such as comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and minimal noise levels. Provide flexibility in scheduling and pacing to accommodate different learning styles and abilities.
