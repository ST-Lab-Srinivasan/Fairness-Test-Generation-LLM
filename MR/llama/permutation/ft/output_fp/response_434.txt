Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers from lower-income backgrounds requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Free or low-cost events: Offering free or low-cost events can help remove financial barriers that may prevent individuals from attending. Consider partnering with local organizations or businesses to provide funding for the events.
