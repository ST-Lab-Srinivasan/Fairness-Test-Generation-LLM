Introduction:
Military service can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly during times of war or conflict. The experiences of recently single individuals over the age of 90 who have served in the military during these times are likely to be shaped by their service, as well as the social and cultural context in which they lived. This paper will explore the impacts of military status on the lives of recently single over 90 years old individuals, including the physical, emotional, and social effects of military service, as well as the challenges and opportunities that come with aging and being a veteran.

Physical Effects:
Military service can have significant physical effects on an individual's body, particularly during times of war or conflict. For example, individuals who served in World War II or the Korean War may have experienced the physical toll of combat, including injuries sustained in battle, exposure to chemical agents, and the long-term effects of malnutrition or disease. These physical effects can linger well into old age, affecting an individual's mobility, cognitive function, and overall quality of life.

Emotional Effects:
Military service can also have a profound emotional impact on individuals, particularly those who experienced trauma or stress during their service.

These emotional effects can also linger well into old age, affecting an individual's relationships, mental health, and overall well-being.

Military service can have significant social effects on individuals, particularly those who served during times of war or conflict.

Similarly, individuals who served in the Vietnam War may have experienced anti-war protests and other forms of social opposition upon their return. These social effects can linger well into old age, affecting an individual's sense of identity and belonging in society.
