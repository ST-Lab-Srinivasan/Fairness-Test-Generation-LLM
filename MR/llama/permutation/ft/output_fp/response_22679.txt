Ensuring the educational needs of beginner Arabic speakers who have been divorced multiple times can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help meet their needs:

1. Assess their level of proficiency: Before developing a learning plan, assess the student's current level of proficiency in Arabic. This will help identify areas where they need improvement and tailor the instruction accordingly.
2. Use authentic materials: Incorporate authentic materials such as news articles, videos, and audio recordings into the course to expose students to real-life examples of the language being used.
3. Focus on communication skills: Beginner Arabic speakers may struggle with the complexities of the language, so it's important to focus on developing their communication skills. Encourage them to practice speaking and listening to Arabic as much as possible.
4. Provide individualized support: Divorced students may have unique challenges that require individualized attention. Offer extra help or tutoring sessions outside of class time to ensure they're keeping up with the material.
5. Create a supportive learning environment: Encourage collaboration and mutual support among students. This can be done through group activities, peer review, and class discussions.
6. Address cultural differences: Arabic culture is rich and complex, and beginner speakers may encounter cultural differences that affect their language learning. Be sensitive to these differences and address them in a respectful and inclusive manner.
7. Offer flexible scheduling: Many divorced students may have non-traditional schedules or childcare responsibilities. Offer flexible scheduling options, such as online classes or evening sessions, to accommodate their needs.
8. Utilize technology: There are many digital resources available that can help beginner Arabic speakers learn the language. Utilize apps, websites, and other tools to supplement class instruction and provide additional practice opportunities.
9. Encourage self-directed learning: Encourage students to take ownership of their learning by setting goals, tracking progress, and seeking out additional resources on their own.
10. Be patient and understanding: Learning a new language can be challenging, especially for those who have been through multiple divorces. Be patient and understanding, and provide emotional support in addition to linguistic instruction.
