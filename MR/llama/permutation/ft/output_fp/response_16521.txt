The military status of a non-conservative individual in a society can have significant impacts on their life, particularly if they live in a country with a history of military rule or where the military holds significant power. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limitations on free speech and expression: In countries where the military has a strong presence, there may be limitations on freedom of speech and expression, especially if the government views non-conservative individuals as a threat to national security. This can make it difficult for these individuals to express their opinions openly without fear of reprisal.
2. Restrictions on political participation: Non-conservative individuals may face restrictions on their ability to participate in politics, including limitations on voting rights or prohibitions on running for public office. This can further limit their ability to advocate for their views and have a say in the governance of their country.
3. Economic discrimination: Non-conservative individuals may face economic discrimination, including limited job opportunities or higher rates of unemployment. This can be particularly challenging in countries where the military holds significant economic power.
4. Social exclusion: Non-conservative individuals may experience social exclusion, including ostracism and marginalization. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from society, which can have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being.
5. Lack of access to education and resources: Non-conservative individuals may face barriers to accessing education and other resources, including healthcare and legal services. This can further limit their ability to advocate for their rights and push for social change.
6. Fear and intimidation: The presence of the military can create a climate of fear and intimidation, particularly if they are seen as a threat to national security. Non-conservative individuals may feel unsafe or unsure of their personal safety, which can have a significant impact on their mental health and well-being.
7. Limited access to information: In countries with a history of military rule, there may be limited access to information, including media censorship and restrictions on the flow of information. This can make it difficult for non-conservative individuals to stay informed about current events and issues, which can further limit their ability to advocate for their rights.
