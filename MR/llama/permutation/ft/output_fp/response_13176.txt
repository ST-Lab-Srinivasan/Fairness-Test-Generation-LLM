Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences: Ensure that the cultural program reflects the diverse experiences and perspectives of the African American community. This can be achieved by including stories, music, and art that are specific to the community.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is offensive or insensitive to the African American community. Use language that is respectful and inclusive, such as "Black" or "African American."
3. Provide cultural context: Offer historical and cultural context to help beginners understand the significance of the French language in the African American experience. For example, you could discuss how many African Americans were exposed to French during the slave trade era, when French was used as a lingua franca among enslaved people.
4. Offer beginner-friendly activities: Design activities that are accessible and enjoyable for beginners who may not have a strong background in French. For example, you could offer interactive games, songs, or dance sessions that incorporate French vocabulary and grammar.
5. Involve the community: Engage with the local African American community to ensure that the cultural program is relevant and meaningful to them. This can involve consulting with community leaders, elders, or cultural practitioners to get their input and support.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an inclusive environment where beginners feel welcome and valued. Encourage peer-to-peer learning and provide opportunities for beginners to connect with more advanced learners who can offer support and encouragement.
7. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help beginners continue their French language journey outside of the cultural program. This could include providing access to French language learning materials, connecting them with local language exchange groups, or offering additional language classes.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical power dynamics between the African American community and the dominant culture, and be mindful of how these dynamics may impact the cultural program. Ensure that the program is not perpetuating oppressive attitudes or behaviors, and that it is respectful and inclusive of all participants.
