As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must first emphasize that creating inclusive community programs for any group of people requires careful consideration and sensitivity towards their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive community programs for lifelong single ultra-liberal individuals:

1. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that all single individuals are the same or that they share the same beliefs and values. Instead, listen to their individual perspectives and experiences to better understand their needs and preferences.
2. Include diverse representation: Ensure that your community programs include diverse representation of people from different backgrounds, ages, races, ethnicities, religions, genders, and sexual orientations. This will help create a more inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
3. Provide flexible options: Offer flexible programming options to accommodate the varied schedules and needs of single individuals. For example, provide online or virtual programs for those who may have limited mobility or prefer to participate from home.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for single individuals to connect with each other and feel a sense of belonging within the community. This could involve organizing social events, creating discussion groups, or offering mentorship programs.
5. Avoid ageism and ableism: Be mindful of ageist or ableist language or practices that may exclusionary or offensive to single individuals. Instead, focus on creating inclusive environments where everyone can participate and contribute.
6. Address intersectionality: Recognize that single individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination based on their race, gender, sexuality, class, or other aspects of their identity. Address these intersections of oppression by incorporating diverse perspectives and experiences into your community programs.
7. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that your community programs are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. This may involve providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, braille materials, or sign language interpretation.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play within your community programs and work to address any imbalances. For example, involve single individuals in decision-making processes and create opportunities for them to take on leadership roles.
9. Provide support
