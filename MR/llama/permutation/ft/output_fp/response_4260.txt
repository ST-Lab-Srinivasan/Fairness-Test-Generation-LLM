6. Career coaching: Offer career coaching sessions to help them identify new goals and aspirations, explore job opportunities within the company or outside of it, and create a plan for their professional development.
7. Financial assistance: Provide financial assistance, such as a one-time payment or a fund to help with funeral expenses, medical bills, or other related costs.
8. Wellness programs: Offer wellness programs that promote physical and mental health, such as gym memberships, yoga classes, or meditation workshops.
