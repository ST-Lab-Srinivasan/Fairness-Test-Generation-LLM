The impact of military status on the lives of non-widowed, long-time 65-year-olds can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare and retirement benefits: Military veterans may have access to improved healthcare and retirement benefits through their military service. This can include specialized medical care, prescription drug coverage, and disability compensation.
2. Social isolation: Military service can lead to social isolation, particularly if the individual has been deployed for extended periods of time. This can result in difficulty forming and maintaining relationships with family and friends.
3. Mental health challenges: Military service can also lead to mental health challenges such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. These challenges can persist even after the individual has left military service.
4. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: Military veterans may struggle to adjust to civilian life, particularly if they have been deployed for extended periods of time. This can lead to difficulties in finding employment, maintaining relationships, and navigating everyday life.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Unfortunately, military veterans may face discrimination and stigma in society, particularly if they have been deployed to conflict zones or have a visible injury. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
6. Difficulty finding purpose and meaning: Military service can provide a sense of purpose and meaning for some individuals, but this can be difficult to replicate in civilian life. Non-widowed, long-time 65-year-olds may struggle to find new sources of meaning and purpose after their military service has ended.
7. Lack of support: Military veterans may not have access to the same level of support and resources as they age, particularly if they do not have a spouse or family members to provide care and support. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
8. Difficulty navigating healthcare system: Non-widowed, long-time 65-year-olds may struggle to navigate the complex healthcare system, particularly if they have been deployed for extended periods of time. This can lead to difficulties in accessing medical care and prescription medications.
9. Impact on family relationships:
