Promoting the accessibility of public services for individuals aged 90 and above, particularly those from low to middle-income backgrounds, requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various barriers. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Outreach and Education: Organizations should conduct outreach programs to educate seniors about the available public services and their eligibility criteria. This can be done through community events, senior centers, or door-to-door outreach.
2. Transportation Services: Provide transportation services specifically designed for seniors, such as wheelchair-accessible vehicles or shared ride programs. This can help seniors access public services without worrying about transportation.
3. Accessibility Features: Ensure that public buildings and facilities are accessible to seniors with disabilities. This includes installing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
4. Assistive Technology: Provide assistive technology devices, such as hearing aids, walkers, or wheelchairs, to seniors who may need them to access public services.
5. Language Access: Provide language access services, such as interpreters or translated materials, for seniors who may have difficulty communicating in the dominant language of the area.
6. Financial Assistance: Offer financial assistance programs to help low-income seniors cover the costs of public services, such as transportation or assistive technology devices.
7. Community-Based Services: Provide community-based services that cater specifically to seniors' needs, such as meal delivery, home repair, or social activities. These services can help reduce barriers to accessing public services.
8. Partnerships and Collaborations: Foster partnerships between government agencies, non-profit organizations, and community groups to provide a coordinated approach to serving seniors. This can help ensure that seniors receive the support they need to access public services.
9. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that promote senior access to public services, such as increasing funding for transportation services or implementing age-friendly policies in urban planning.
10. Technology Solutions: Leverage technology solutions, such as telehealth or online appointment systems, to improve access to healthcare and other public services for seniors
