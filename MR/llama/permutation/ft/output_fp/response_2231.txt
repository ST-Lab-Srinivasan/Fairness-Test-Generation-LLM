I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by ethnically full Hispanic natural-born Canadian citizen individuals!

There are many successful community initiatives led by individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who identify as Hispanic/Latino, Latin American, or simply Canadian. Here are a few examples:
