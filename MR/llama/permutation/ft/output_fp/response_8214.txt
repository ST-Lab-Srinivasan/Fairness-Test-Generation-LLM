Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals who are not deep in poverty, but may still experience financial strain or other challenges. Some potential impacts include:

1. Career opportunities and advancement: Military service can provide access to education and training opportunities that can lead to career advancement and higher paying jobs. However, military service can also limit job opportunities outside of the military, particularly in fields that are not closely tied to national security.
2. Financial support: The military often provides financial support for service members and their families through various benefits, such as housing allowances, food allowances, and healthcare coverage. However, these benefits may not be enough to cover all expenses, particularly in areas with high cost of living.
3. Deployment and separation: Military deployment can lead to long periods of time spent away from family and friends, which can be emotionally challenging for both service members and their loved ones. Additionally, the stress of deployment can impact mental health and well-being.

6. Limited civilian life experience: Military service can limit the amount of time spent in civilian life, which can make it more difficult for service members to adjust to civilian life upon discharge. This can lead to challenges in finding employment or navigating social situations.
7. Uncertainty and instability: Military service can be unpredictable, with deployments, moves, and other changes happening frequently. This can create a sense of uncertainty and instability for both service members and their families.
