5. Support advocacy efforts: Encourage carriers to get involved in advocacy efforts, such as lobbying for better access to healthcare or participating in awareness campaigns to raise money for research and support services.
6. Foster connections between carriers: Organize events or gatherings that bring together carriers of different genetic conditions. This can help create a sense of community and connection among individuals who may feel isolated or alone.
