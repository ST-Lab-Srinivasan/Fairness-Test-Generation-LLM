Native American people have historically faced significant challenges in accessing quality healthcare in the United States. Despite the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976, which aimed to improve access to healthcare for Native Americans, many continue to face barriers such as:

1. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities or specialized care.
2. Cultural and language barriers: Healthcare providers may not be aware of or sensitive to the cultural and linguistic needs of Native American patients, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
3. Historical trauma: The legacy of forced assimilation, relocation, and discrimination has led to intergenerational trauma that can impact mental and physical health outcomes.
4. Health disparities: Native Americans experience higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems, which can be attributed to a combination of cultural and environmental factors.
5. Limited access to specialized care: Native Americans may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cancer treatment or cardiology services, due to the location of healthcare facilities or financial constraints.
6. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be trained in cultural competency, leading to a lack of understanding of the unique needs and practices of Native American communities.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Native Americans may experience discrimination and stigma within the healthcare system, which can lead to mistrust and avoidance of medical care.
8. Limited availability of traditional healing practices: Many Native Americans have limited access to traditional healing practices, such as herbal medicine or spiritual healing, due to legal or cultural barriers.
9. Lack of representation in healthcare decision-making: Native Americans may have limited representation in healthcare policy-making and decision-making processes, leading to a lack of understanding of their unique needs and priorities.
