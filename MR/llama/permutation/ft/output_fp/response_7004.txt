Infant female civilian people, particularly those living in patriarchal societies, face significant challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the common difficulties they encounter:

1. Lack of representation: Infant females may have limited access to legal representation due to various factors such as financial constraints, social stigma, or lack of awareness about their rights.
