1. Accessible Healthcare Facilities: Set up healthcare facilities in areas with high concentrations of recent immigrants, especially in low-income neighborhoods. These facilities should provide affordable and quality healthcare services to meet the needs of these populations.
2. Language Assistance: Provide language assistance to recent immigrants, particularly those who may not speak the local language fluently. This can be done by hiring interpreters or providing translation services in hospitals and clinics.
