Creating more inclusive cultural programs for asexual (ace) individuals who are not in a romantic or sexual relationship requires understanding, respect, and accommodation. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the ace community, their experiences, and the challenges they face. This will help you create programs that are sensitive to their needs.
2. Involve ace individuals in planning and decision-making: Aces can help design programs that are tailored to their needs and preferences. This will ensure that your program is inclusive and meets their expectations.
3. Use language that is inclusive: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is romantically or sexually involved. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of relationships and identities. For example, instead of saying "couples," use "individuals" or "friends."
4. Provide alternatives to romantic or sexual content: Aces may feel uncomfortable with content that is focused on romance or sexuality. Offer alternative activities or content that is more inclusive and respectful of their identity.
5. Create a safe space: Ensure that your program creates a safe and welcoming environment for aces. This can be done by being mindful of language and behavior, and by providing a quiet space for individuals who may need it.
6. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt and make changes based on feedback from ace individuals. This will show that you are committed to creating an inclusive environment.
7. Engage in outreach and marketing efforts: Reach out to the ace community through social media, flyers, or other marketing materials. This will help ensure that aces feel welcome and included in your program.
8. Train staff and volunteers: Provide training for staff and volunteers on how to interact with aces and create an inclusive environment.
9. Be patient and understanding: Remember that aces may have different needs and preferences than others. Be patient and understanding, and be willing to accommodate their requests.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of relationships and identities within your program. This will help create an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
