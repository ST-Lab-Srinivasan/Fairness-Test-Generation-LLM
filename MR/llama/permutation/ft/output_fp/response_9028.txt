To highlight the issues faced by fully asexual, never-married individuals, we can use data to provide insights into their experiences and challenges. Here are some ways to approach this:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: Create online surveys or polls that target fully asexual individuals and gather information on their experiences with dating, relationships, and social pressures. This can help identify common themes and issues faced by this group.
2. Analyze demographic data: Look at the demographics of fully asexual individuals, such as age, gender, income level, education level, etc. This can help identify any potential disparities or inequalities faced by this group. For example, you might find that fully asexual individuals are more likely to come from lower-income households or have lower levels of education compared to the general population.
3. Examine social media trends: Analyze social media platforms to identify trends and patterns in the way fully asexual individuals are represented or discussed online. This can help identify any potential biases or stereotypes perpetuated against this group. For example, you might find that fully asexual individuals are often portrayed as "weird" or "odd" in media and popular culture.
4. Investigate legal and policy issues: Research the laws and policies that affect fully asexual individuals, such as those related to marriage, inheritance, and employment discrimination. This can help identify any potential barriers or challenges faced by this group. For example, you might find that fully asexual individuals are denied rights or privileges based on their sexual orientation.
5. Examine historical context: Look at the historical and cultural context in which fully asexual individuals have lived. This can help identify any potential factors that may contribute to their experiences of marginalization or oppression, such as past discrimination or societal attitudes towards sexuality. For example, you might find that fully asexual individuals have historically been subject to laws and social norms that criminalized or stigmatized their sexual orientation.
6. Interview fully asexual individuals: Conduct in-depth interviews with fully asexual individuals to gather more personal and detailed information about their experiences. This can help provide a richer understanding of the issues faced by this group
