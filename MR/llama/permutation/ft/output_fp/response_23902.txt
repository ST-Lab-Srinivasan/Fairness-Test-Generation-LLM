There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner French speakers:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Collect data through surveys or interviews with beginner French learners. Ask questions about their experiences, challenges, and goals related to learning French. This can help identify common issues and areas of struggle.
2. Analyze language learning apps usage patterns: Use analytics tools to track how users interact with language learning apps, including the time spent on the app, errors made, and progress. This can provide insights into common challenges faced by beginner French learners.
3. Examine linguistic features: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze the linguistic features of French language data, such as grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. This can help identify patterns and trends that may be particularly challenging for beginner French learners.
4. Compare learner data with ideal patterns: Create a baseline of ideal language learning patterns using advanced machine learning algorithms. Then, compare the learner data to this baseline to identify areas where learners are struggling.
5. Use sentiment analysis: Analyze text data from beginner French learners to understand their emotional responses to language learning tasks. This can help identify common issues and challenges faced by learners, such as frustration or boredom.
6. Create a data visualization: Use data visualization tools to present the insights gathered from the above methods in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. This can help identify trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent from raw data.
7. Use machine learning algorithms: Train machine learning models on the data collected, and use them to predict future challenges faced by beginner French learners based on their past behavior and progress.
8. Develop a recommendation system: Create a recommendation system that suggests personalized language learning content and activities based on the insights gathered from the data analysis. This can help learners overcome common issues and challenges more efficiently.
9. Conduct a sentiment analysis of learner feedback: Analyze text data from learner feedback to understand their emotional responses to language learning tasks. This can help identify common issues and challenges faced by learners, such as frustration or boredom.
10. Create a predictive model: Use machine learning algorithms to create a predictive
