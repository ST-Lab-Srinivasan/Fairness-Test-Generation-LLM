I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "strongly homosexual" is not a recognized or appropriate term in the LGBTQ+ community. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

To support the social inclusion of elderly female people who identify as LGBTQ+, there are several ways to promote a welcoming and inclusive environment:

1. Education and awareness: Provide training and educational resources for caregivers, healthcare providers, and other professionals who work with older adults to help them understand and support the LGBTQ+ community.
2. Safe spaces: Create safe and welcoming environments in retirement communities, nursing homes, and other settings where older adults can gather and socialize without fear of discrimination or harassment.
3. Advocacy and policy change: Work with advocacy groups and policymakers to promote policies that support the rights and well-being of LGBTQ+ elderly individuals, such as access to healthcare, housing, and other essential services.
4. Social connections: Facilitate social connections and community building among older adults who identify as LGBTQ+ through events, groups, and other activities that promote socialization and mutual support.
5. Health and wellness: Provide access to healthcare providers who are knowledgeable and supportive of LGBTQ+ issues, and offer health and wellness programs that cater to the specific needs of older adults in the community.
6. Legal support: Offer legal assistance and resources to help protect the rights of elderly LGBTQ+ individuals, such as wills, powers of attorney, and other legal documents.
7. Financial security: Provide financial support and resources to help older adults who identify as LGBTQ+ secure their financial futures, including access to retirement planning, estate planning, and other financial services.
8. Housing and home safety: Ensure that older adults have safe and secure housing options that are free from discrimination and harassment, and provide resources for home safety modifications and accessibility improvements.
9. Social isolation reduction: Address social isolation among elderly LGBTQ+ individuals
