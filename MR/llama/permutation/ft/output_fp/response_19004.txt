Highlighting the issues faced by non-upper-class Nigerians requires a data-driven approach that provides insights into their socioeconomic status, access to basic amenities, and overall well-being. Here are some ways to use data to highlight these issues:

1. Poverty rates: Use data on poverty rates in Nigeria to identify the areas where non-upper-class individuals are most affected. According to the World Bank, in 2020, the poverty rate in Nigeria was 40.1%, with rural areas being more affected than urban areas.
2. Income inequality: Analyze data on income inequality in Nigeria to understand the disparities in wealth distribution. The Gini coefficient, which ranges from 0 to 1, can be used to measure income inequality. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Nigeria has a Gini coefficient of 0.53, indicating high income inequality.
3. Education: Collect data on access to education, particularly in rural areas, and analyze the quality of education provided. This can help identify the challenges faced by non-upper-class students in accessing quality education. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), in 2019, only 65% of children aged 5-14 years old in Nigeria were attending school, with rural areas having lower enrollment rates than urban areas.
4. Health: Collect data on access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas, and analyze the quality of healthcare provided. This can help identify the challenges faced by non-upper-class individuals in accessing quality healthcare. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2019, Nigeria had a life expectancy of 54 years, with rural areas having lower life expectancies than urban areas.
5. Access to basic amenities: Collect data on access to basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity. This can help identify the challenges faced by non-upper-class individuals in accessing these essential services. According to the Nigerian Governors' Forum, in 2020, only 54% of households in Nigeria had access to improved sanitation facilities, while only 40% had access to electricity.
