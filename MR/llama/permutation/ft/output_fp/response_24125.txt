Extreme moderate liberal Native recent immigrants to the US may face a range of challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some potential issues:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who do not speak English fluently, navigating the healthcare system can be particularly difficult. They may struggle to communicate their symptoms or understand medical instructions, leading to delayed or inadequate care.
2. Cultural differences: The healthcare system in the US is often based on Western medical traditions, which may not align with the cultural beliefs and practices of recent immigrants. For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on holistic approaches to health, such as traditional medicine or spiritual healing, which may not be recognized or covered by US health insurance.
3. Access to care: Recent immigrants may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to legal or financial constraints. For instance, they may not have health insurance or may struggle to afford medical services. Additionally, some immigrants may be afraid to seek medical care due to fear of deportation or discrimination.
4. Lack of cultural competence: The healthcare system in the US may not always take into account the diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences of recent immigrants. Providers may not be trained in cultural sensitivity or may make assumptions about patients based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin.
5. Discrimination: Recent immigrants may experience discrimination within the healthcare system, particularly if they are perceived as "foreign" or "other." This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and difficulty accessing care.
6. Health disparities: Recent immigrants may face health disparities due to a lack of access to preventive care, screenings, and other services. They may also experience poorer health outcomes due to exposure to environmental hazards or unhealthy living conditions in their countries of origin or during their migration journey.
7. Mental health challenges: The immigration process can be traumatic, leading to mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent immigrants may struggle to access mental health services due to language barriers or cultural differences.
8. Lack of knowledge
