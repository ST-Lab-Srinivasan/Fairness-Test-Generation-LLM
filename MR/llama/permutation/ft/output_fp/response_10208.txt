Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of temporary visa holders and recent immigrants to Canada. It can shape their identity, influence their daily routines, and provide a sense of belonging in their new country. Here are some ways cultural heritage affects these individuals:

1. Identity formation: Temporary visa holders and recent immigrants often maintain ties to their home culture while adapting to life in Canada. Cultural heritage can help them navigate this dual identity and find a sense of belonging in their new country.
2. Comfort and familiarity: For those from diverse backgrounds, cultural heritage can provide a sense of comfort and familiarity in an unfamiliar environment. It can offer a sense of continuity and stability during times of change and transition.
3. Community building: Cultural heritage can serve as a foundation for building a community among recent immigrants. Sharing cultural practices, traditions, and values with others from the same background can help create a sense of belonging and connection to their new home.
4. Preservation of cultural practices: Temporary visa holders and recent immigrants may feel pressure to assimilate into Canadian culture or risk losing their status in Canada.

This can help preserve cultural heritage across generations and provide a sense of continuity despite changes in location or status.
8. Economic opportunities: Cultural heritage can also play a role in the economic integration of recent immigrants. For example, starting a business that reflects their cultural background
