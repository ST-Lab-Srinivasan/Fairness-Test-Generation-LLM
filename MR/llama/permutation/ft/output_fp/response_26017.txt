I'm glad you're interested in learning about and appreciating the cultural contributions of diverse communities! However, I must clarify that using terms like "ethnically full" or "non-lower-class" can be problematic as they are based on social constructs and may perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

Instead, let's focus on celebrating the cultural contributions of Asian communities in a respectful and inclusive manner. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Learn about and appreciate the history and culture of Asian communities: Take the time to research and learn about the rich cultural heritage of Asian communities, including their historical experiences, traditions, and customs.
2. Engage in cultural exchange programs: Organize or participate in cultural exchange programs that bring together people from different Asian communities to share their traditions, music, dance, art, and food.
3. Support Asian-owned businesses and initiatives: Show your support for Asian-owned businesses and initiatives that promote cultural diversity and inclusivity.
4. Advocate for representation and inclusion in media and education: Encourage media representation and education that reflects the diversity of Asian communities, including their experiences, traditions, and contributions.
5. Attend cultural events and festivals: Attend cultural events and festivals that celebrate the diversity of Asian communities, such as Lunar New Year, Diwali, or the Cherry Blossom Festival.
6. Learn about and respect cultural norms and traditions: Respect the cultural norms and traditions of Asian communities, including their food, clothing, and social etiquette.
