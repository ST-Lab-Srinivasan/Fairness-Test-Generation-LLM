Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for non-pregnant adults who are native French speakers:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they can build stronger relationships with their patients, leading to higher patient satisfaction and trust.
