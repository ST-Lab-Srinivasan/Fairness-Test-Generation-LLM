Creating more inclusive social policies for non-citizens, particularly those who are undocumented or have recently been through the deportation process, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges and barriers they face. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Address Language Barriers: Many non-citizens may face language barriers that hinder their ability to access social services and benefits. Providing language interpretation and translation services can help bridge this gap and ensure that everyone has equal access to information and resources.
2. Improve Access to Healthcare: Non-citizens may face challenges accessing healthcare due to lack of health insurance or fear of deportation. Inclusive social policies should prioritize improving access to affordable and comprehensive healthcare for all, regardless of immigration status.
3. Foster Community Engagement: Building inclusive communities requires fostering engagement and participation among diverse groups. Social policies can promote community engagement by investing in cultural events, festivals, and programs that celebrate diversity and bring people together.
4. Promote Education and Skills Development: Non-citizens may face barriers to education and skills development due to language barriers or lack of access to resources. Inclusive social policies should prioritize investing in education and training programs that provide opportunities for all to acquire new skills and knowledge.
5. Address Housing Instability: Non-citizens may face housing instability due to lack of access to affordable and safe housing. Social policies can address this issue by investing in affordable housing initiatives, rent subsidies, and emergency shelter programs.
6. Support Legal Representation: Non-citizens may face challenges navigating the legal system due to language barriers or lack of access to legal representation. Inclusive social policies should prioritize providing free or low-cost legal services to ensure that everyone has equal access to justice.
7. Address Employment Discrimination: Non-citizens may face employment discrimination due to their immigration status. Inclusive social policies should promote fair hiring practices and protect the rights of all workers, regardless of immigration status.
8. Advocate for Immigration Reform: Ultimately, creating more inclusive social policies
