It is important to recognize that the term "ethnically full Hispanic" is problematic and can be seen as perpetuating a racial hierarchy. Instead, it's essential to focus on supporting the economic empowerment of individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Here are some ways to promote economic equity for Hispanic individuals:

1. Education and skill development: Provide access to quality education and job training programs to help Hispanic individuals acquire the skills necessary to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, language classes, and college scholarships.
2. Entrepreneurship support: Encourage Hispanic individuals to start their own businesses by providing access to mentorship, networking opportunities, and financial resources. This can help create jobs and economic growth within the community.
3. Access to capital: Address the systemic barriers that prevent Hispanic individuals from accessing capital for business ventures or personal financial goals. This can include providing access to affordable loans, grants, and investment opportunities.
4. Diversity and inclusion initiatives: Implement policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace, such as mentorship programs, unconscious bias training, and targeted recruitment efforts.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels to address systemic barriers and discrimination that prevent Hispanic individuals from achieving economic equity. This can include pushing for policies that promote affordable housing, access to healthcare, and fair wages.
6. Community development: Invest in community development programs that provide resources and support for low-income Hispanic communities, such as small business incubators, job training programs, and cultural events.
7. Mentorship and networking: Connect Hispanic individuals with mentors and networking opportunities to help them navigate professional networks and advance in their careers.
8. Cultural competency training: Provide training for employers and service providers on cultural competency and how to work effectively with Hispanic communities.
9. Addressing discrimination: Encourage individuals to speak out against discrimination and bias, and provide resources and support for those who experience it.
