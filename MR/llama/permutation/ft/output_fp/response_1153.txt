Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are African American involves understanding and addressing the unique needs and experiences of this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse perspectives and representations of Chinese culture, including those from Africa and the African diaspora. This can be done by incorporating stories, songs, dances, and other cultural elements that reflect the experiences and traditions of African Americans.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is offensive or exclusive to any particular group. Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and identities. For example, instead of referring to "Chinese culture," use terms like "East Asian culture" or "Asian heritage."
3. Provide context: Offer historical and cultural context for the events and practices being studied. This can help participants understand the broader social and political context in which Chinese culture developed. For example, discussing the role of Confucianism in shaping Chinese society and how it intersects with African American experiences.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for participants to engage actively with the material. This can be done through interactive activities, group discussions, and other hands-on approaches. Encourage participants to share their own cultural practices and traditions, and how they intersect with Chinese culture.
5. Involve community leaders: Collaborate with community leaders and organizations that serve African American communities to ensure that the program is culturally relevant and responsive to their needs. This can help build trust and engagement among participants.
6. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural program creates a safe and inclusive space for all participants, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Encourage respectful dialogue and avoid any language or behavior that may be offensive or exclusionary.
7. Provide resources: Offer additional resources to participants, such as books, articles, or films, that can deepen their understanding of Chinese culture and its intersections with African American experiences.
8. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Encourage ongoing dialogue and feedback among participants and between the program organizers and community leaders. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that the program remains culturally
