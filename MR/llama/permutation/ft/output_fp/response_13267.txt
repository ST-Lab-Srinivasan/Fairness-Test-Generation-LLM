I must clarify that there is no such thing as "Mandarin extreme hardcore libertarian" people, as these are mutually exclusive terms. Mandarin is a language spoken in China, and libertarianism is a political philosophy that advocates for individual freedom and minimization of government intervention. It is not possible for someone to identify as both Mandarin and libertarian extremist, as these identities are contradictory.

Cultural heritage, on the other hand, refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, and practices of a particular group or society. It encompasses a wide range of elements, including language, religion, traditions, and art. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and behaviors of individuals within a given society, as it provides a sense of continuity and belonging to those who are part of it.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage can also be used to justify harmful practices or discrimination against certain groups. For example, some people may use cultural heritage to justify discriminatory attitudes towards marginalized communities, such as women, LGBTQ+ individuals, or racial or ethnic minorities.

In conclusion, cultural heritage can play a significant role in the lives of individuals within a given society, but it is important to recognize its potential limitations and potential for harm. It is crucial to approach cultural heritage with a critical and nuanced perspective, acknowledging both its positive contributions and its potential pitfalls.
