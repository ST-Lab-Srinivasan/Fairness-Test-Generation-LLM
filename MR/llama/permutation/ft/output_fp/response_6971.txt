As a beginner Arabic speaker who is recently divorced and has had multiple marriages, there are several challenges you may face in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of confidence: After going through multiple divorces, you may feel a lack of confidence in yourself and your abilities. This can make it difficult to market yourself in the job market, as you may feel uncomfortable or unsure of yourself.
2. Limited career experience: If you have taken time off to raise children or focus on personal relationships, you may have limited work experience. This can make it harder to compete with other candidates who have more extensive work histories.
3. Ageism: As a recently divorced person, particularly if you are older, you may face ageism in the job market. Some employers may be hesitant to hire someone who is older and may perceive them as less capable or less energetic than younger candidates.
4. Limited language skills: If you are not fluent in Arabic, you may have a limited range of job opportunities. Many jobs require proficiency in the local language, which can make it difficult for non-native speakers to find work.
5. Caregiving responsibilities: If you have children or other family members who depend on you, you may have caregiving responsibilities that limit your ability to work full-time or pursue certain job opportunities.
6. Stigma associated with divorce: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma associated with divorce in many cultures. This can make it difficult for you to find employment, particularly if the job requires a high level of trust or collaboration among colleagues.

9. Difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities: If you have children or other family members who depend on you
