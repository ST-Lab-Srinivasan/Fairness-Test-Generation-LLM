Soft libertarians, also known as "left-libertarians" or "social libertarians," are individuals who believe in the importance of individual freedom and autonomy, but also recognize the value of community and social welfare. Here are some successful community initiatives led by soft libertarian permanent resident individuals:

1. Community Land Trusts: Soft libertarians often advocate for Community Land Trusts (CLTs), which are non-profit organizations that hold land for the benefit of a community, rather than private individuals. CLTs allow residents to purchase homes or plots of land at below-market prices, while also ensuring that the land remains affordable and accessible to future generations.
2. Co-operative Housing: Soft libertarians may also support co-operative housing models, where residents own and control their living space through a democratic structure. This approach allows for greater autonomy and decision-making power among residents, while also promoting community building and mutual aid.
3. Mutual Aid Networks: Soft libertarians may establish mutual aid networks, where individuals come together to provide support and resources to one another. These networks can take various forms, such as food sharing programs, childcare co-ops, or disaster response teams. By pooling their resources and expertise, members of these networks can help each other navigate challenges and build stronger, more resilient communities.
4. Public Spaces: Soft libertarians may advocate for the creation of public spaces that promote social interaction and community building. These spaces can include parks, plazas, or community centers, and are designed to facilitate collaboration and connection among residents. By providing opportunities for people to come together and engage in shared activities, these spaces can help build stronger, more cohesive communities.
5. Local Currencies: Soft libertarians may also support the development of local currencies, which allow residents to exchange goods and services without relying on national currencies. By creating a separate, community-based currency, residents can promote economic autonomy and mutual aid within their own communities.
6. Urban Gardening Initiatives: Soft libertarians may lead initiatives to create urban gardens or community gardens, which allow residents to grow their own food and connect with nature in
