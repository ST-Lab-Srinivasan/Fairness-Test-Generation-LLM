Promoting the financial stability of very old (90s+) documented individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses their unique financial challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Encourage retirement savings: Many older adults may not have sufficient retirement savings, making it crucial to encourage them to start saving early and consistently. Governments and financial institutions can offer incentives for retirement savings, such as tax breaks or matching funds.
