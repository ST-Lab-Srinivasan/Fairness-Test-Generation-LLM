I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those with disabilities. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Discrimination against any group of people based on their political affiliation or any other characteristic is not acceptable and goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

It is important to recognize that ableism, like any other form of discrimination, can have serious consequences for the well-being and dignity of individuals and communities. It can limit access to opportunities, resources, and services, and can lead to social isolation, marginalization, and exclusion.

Instead of perpetuating harmful attitudes and practices, it is important to work towards creating an inclusive and accessible society that values and respects the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This can involve challenging ableist attitudes and behaviors, promoting accessibility and inclusion in all aspects of life, and advocating for policies and practices that promote the well-being and dignity of all individuals.

In conclusion, political affiliation should not be used to discriminate or stigmatize any group of people, including those with disabilities. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent worth and dignity, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and accessible society for all.
