Introduction:
Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of recently widowed individuals, particularly those who are turning 65. As a group, these individuals may face unique challenges related to their military service and the loss of a spouse. This study aims to explore the specific impacts of military status on the lives of recently widowed just turned 65 individuals.

Literature Review:
The literature suggests that military service can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, military service can provide a sense of purpose, belonging, and identity (Krentz & Neimeyer, 2013). On the other hand, military service can also lead to exposure to trauma, loss of loved ones, and stress (Harris et al., 2016). Additionally, research has shown that military widows and widowers often experience unique challenges related to their spouse's death, including grief, social isolation, and economic insecurity (Lambert & Bouchard, 2017).

Methodology:
This study used a qualitative research design, with data collected through semi-structured interviews with recently widowed individuals aged 65 or older. Participants were recruited through local veterans' organizations and online forums. Data analysis involved thematic coding and construction of a conceptual framework to identify the impacts of military status on participants' lives.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that military status has both direct and indirect impacts on the lives of recently widowed just turned 65 individuals. Direct impacts include increased stress, anxiety, and depression related to the loss of a spouse, as well as difficulties with adjusting to retirement and managing finances without a partner. Indirect impacts include feelings of isolation and disconnection from social support networks, as well as challenges related to navigating healthcare and pension systems as a widow or widower.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study suggest that military status can have significant impacts on the lives of recently widowed just turned 65 individuals. These impacts are both direct, such as increased stress and anxiety, and indirect, such as difficulties with social support networks and navigating healthcare systems. It is important
