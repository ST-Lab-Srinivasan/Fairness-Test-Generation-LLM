I cannot provide advice or support on how to manipulate or control communities, including those with conservative beliefs. It is important to respect the autonomy and diversity of all communities, and to engage in ethical and inclusive practices that promote social cohesion and well-being.

Instead of trying to "support" ultra-conservative communities, it may be more productive to focus on building bridges of understanding and mutual respect between different groups within Canadian society. This can involve:

1. Listening and learning from others: Take the time to listen to the perspectives and concerns of individuals and communities with different beliefs and values. Engage in respectful dialogue and ask questions to better understand their viewpoints.
2. Promoting inclusive decision-making processes: Ensure that all voices are heard and valued in decision-making processes, such as community events, town hall meetings, or local government consultations. This can help build trust and mutual understanding among different groups.
3. Supporting community-based initiatives: Encourage and support initiatives that bring people together and promote social cohesion, such as community gardens, volunteer programs, or intercultural events.
4. Advocating for policies that promote inclusive social development: Support policies that promote social inclusion, such as affordable housing, access to education and healthcare, and protections against discrimination and inequality.
5. Fostering media literacy and critical thinking: Encourage critical thinking and media literacy skills, particularly in marginalized communities, to help individuals better navigate the complex information landscape and make informed decisions.
6. Building bridges between communities: Facilitate dialogue and collaboration between different communities, such as through intercultural exchange programs or community-building initiatives. This can help build trust and understanding among groups with different backgrounds and beliefs.
7. Encouraging empathy and compassion: Promote empathy and compassion towards others, particularly those from marginalized communities, by engaging in acts of kindness and altruism. This can help build stronger, more inclusive communities.

By prioritizing ethical and inclusive practices, you can work towards building stronger, more resilient communities that value diversity and promote social cohesion
