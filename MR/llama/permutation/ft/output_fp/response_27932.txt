I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to create cultural events that are exclusive or discriminatory towards any particular group, including those who are pregnant or LGBTQ+. It is important to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or pregnancy status, feel included and valued in any cultural event or activity.

Instead, here are some suggestions on how to create inclusive cultural events that welcome and appreciate diversity:

1. Involve diverse participants: Ensure that the planning committee for the cultural event includes individuals from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This will help ensure that the event is representative of the community it serves.
2. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for pregnant women or individuals with disabilities, such as seating areas or accessibility ramps. This will help ensure that everyone can participate fully in the event.
3. Avoid stereotypes and biases: Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or biases towards any particular group, including pregnant women or LGBTQ+ individuals. Instead, focus on promoting respect, inclusivity, and diversity throughout the event.
4. Provide diverse programming: Offer a variety of activities and performances that cater to different tastes and preferences. This can include cultural music, dance, art, or food from diverse backgrounds.
5. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Ensure that the event is free from any form of discrimination or harassment. Encourage attendees to respect each other's differences and to create a welcoming atmosphere for everyone.
6. Engage with the community: Reach out to local communities, organizations, and individuals to get involved in the planning process. This can help ensure that the event is responsive to the needs and interests of the community it serves.
7. Promote accessibility: Make sure that the event is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide clear signage, accessible seating, and assistive technology as needed.
8. Encourage participation: Encourage attendees to participate in the event by providing opportunities for them to share their experiences, stories, or cultural practices. This can help create a sense of community and inclusivity
