The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-disabled bereaved people can be significant, as it can affect their access to resources, support, and services. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Emotional distress: Losing a loved one is emotionally challenging for anyone, regardless of their immigration status. However, undocumented or unlawfully present individuals may face additional stress due to concerns about their legal status and potential deportation.
2. Access to healthcare: Bereaved people may require medical attention, such as grief counseling or mental health support, but they may face barriers in accessing these services if they are undocumented or uninsured. This can exacerbate their emotional distress and make it harder for them to cope with their loss.
3. Social isolation: Bereaved people may struggle to connect with others who understand their experiences, leading to feelings of loneliness and social isolation. This can be particularly challenging for undocumented or unlawfully present individuals who may fear reaching out to family, friends, or support groups due to their immigration status.
4. Financial difficulties: Bereaved people may face financial strain, such as funeral expenses, medical bills, and lost income due to time taken off work. Undocumented or unlawfully present individuals may struggle to access financial resources, such as government assistance programs, due to their immigration status.
5. Legal barriers: Bereaved people may face legal challenges in navigating the complex immigration system, which can be overwhelming and emotionally draining. They may need help understanding their rights and options, such as applying for a visa or seeking legal aid.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding undocumented immigration, and bereaved people may face discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, funeral homes, or other service providers due to their immigration status. This can further exacerbate their emotional distress and make it harder for them to access support.
7. Limited access to education: Bereaved children who are undocumented or unlawfully present may face challenges in accessing quality education due to their immigration status. This can impact their academic performance, social integration, and future opportunities
