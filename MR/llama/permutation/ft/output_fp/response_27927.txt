As a caring and empathetic AI language model, I appreciate your consideration of creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for extreme soft libertarian individuals who have recently gone through a divorce. It's important to recognize that these individuals may have different needs and preferences when it comes to social interactions and cultural celebrations. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive celebrations for this group:

1. Respect their boundaries: Recognize that extreme soft libertarian individuals may have different comfort levels when it comes to physical touch, social interactions, and cultural practices. Make sure to respect their boundaries and give them space if they need it.
2. Offer choices: Provide a variety of options for cultural celebrations and activities, catering to different preferences and needs. For example, offer both structured and unstructured activities, or provide options for virtual or in-person events.
3. Create safe spaces: Establish safe spaces where extreme soft libertarian individuals can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or rejection. This could involve creating separate spaces for these individuals during cultural celebrations or providing a designated "safe space" online.
4. Avoid assumptions: Refrain from making assumptions about the individual's beliefs, values, or lifestyle based on their divorce status. Instead, ask them directly how they prefer to engage in cultural celebrations and what makes them feel included.
5. Foster a sense of community: Encourage a sense of belonging among extreme soft libertarian individuals by creating opportunities for social interaction and connection. This could involve hosting regular virtual meetups or in-person events, and facilitating discussions on topics that are relevant to their interests.
6. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as flexible scheduling, remote participation options, or physical accommodations (e.g., seating, mobility access) to ensure that extreme soft libertarian individuals can fully participate in cultural celebrations without barriers.
7. Educate others: Raise awareness among the broader community about the needs and preferences of extreme soft libertarian individuals, and encourage others to be respectful and inclusive of their choices. This could involve hosting workshops or training sessions on cultural sensitivity and inclusivity.
8. Celebrate individuality: Embrace the diversity
