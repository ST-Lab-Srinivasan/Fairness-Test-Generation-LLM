Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-recently divorced individuals requires understanding, empathy, and a willingness to challenge traditional norms and practices. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive environment:

5. Foster a welcoming atmosphere: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect by educating event staff and participants on disability etiquette and the importance of including all individuals in cultural celebrations.
