Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of bereaved beginner Spanish speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society. For individuals who are learning Spanish as a second language, their cultural heritage can influence how they learn and understand the language, as well as how they perceive themselves in relation to the Spanish-speaking world.
