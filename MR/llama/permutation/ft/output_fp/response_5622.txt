As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that there is no such thing as a "soft libertarian" person in the legal system. Libertarianism is a political philosophy that advocates for individual freedom and limited government intervention in economic matters. It does not apply to pregnancy or any other personal matter.

However, if you are asking about the challenges faced by pregnant individuals in the legal system, here are some possible ones:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Pregnant individuals may face difficulties in accessing proper medical care, especially in areas with limited healthcare resources. This can result in inadequate prenatal care, which can lead to complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
2. Discrimination: Pregnant individuals may face discrimination in various settings, such as the workplace or when accessing public services. This can result in unfair treatment and limitations on their rights and autonomy.
3. Legal protections: Pregnant individuals may not have adequate legal protections to ensure their health and well-being during pregnancy. For example, some states do not have laws that provide explicit protection against discrimination based on pregnancy or childbirth.
4. Reproductive rights: Pregnant individuals may face challenges in exercising their reproductive rights, such as access to abortion services. In some areas, there may be legal restrictions on abortion, which can limit the ability of pregnant individuals to make decisions about their own bodies and futures.
5. Social stigma: Pregnant individuals may face social stigma or judgment from others, particularly if they are unmarried or have other non-traditional circumstances surrounding their pregnancy. This can lead to feelings of isolation or marginalization.
6. Financial challenges: Pregnant individuals may face financial challenges due to the increased costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth, such as medical expenses, lost income during maternity leave, and childcare costs.
7. Lack of support: Pregnant individuals may not have access to adequate support systems, such as paid family leave or flexible work arrangements, which can make it difficult to balance work and family responsibilities during pregnancy.
