As a neutral AI language model, I cannot make assumptions or generalizations about any particular group of people based on their demographics, including native English speakers who are long-term widows. However, I can provide some general insights and challenges that may be faced by individuals in the job market, regardless of their background or identity.

1. Ageism: Widowed individuals, particularly those over the age of 50, may face age-related discrimination in the job market. Many employers may assume that older workers are less productive or less adaptable than younger employees, which can make it more difficult to find employment.
