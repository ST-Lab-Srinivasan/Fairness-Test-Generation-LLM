Creating inclusive recreational activities for individuals with genetic conditions can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience. Here are some suggestions on how to make these activities more accessible and enjoyable for beginner Arabic speakers:

1. Offer modified activities: Many recreational activities, such as sports or exercise classes, may not be suitable for individuals with genetic conditions due to mobility or physical limitations.
