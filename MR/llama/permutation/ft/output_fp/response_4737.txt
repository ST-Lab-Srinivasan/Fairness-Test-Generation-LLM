This can involve learning about and celebrating the diverse traditions, customs, and beliefs of different Asian ethnic groups, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and more.

Here are some ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of Asian people without perpetuating harmful stereotypes or reinforcing damaging power dynamics:

1. Learn about and appreciate the diversity of Asian cultures: Take the time to learn about the different customs, traditions, and beliefs of various Asian ethnic groups. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, and engaging in conversations with people from different backgrounds.
2. Avoid stereotyping and tokenization: Refrain from reducing Asian people to simplistic stereotypes or tokenizing their cultural contributions. Instead, recognize the complexity and diversity of Asian cultures and treat each individual with respect and dignity.

Avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and power dynamics by centering the experiences and perspectives of these communities.
4. Engage in respectful dialogue: Foster open and respectful dialogue about the cultural contributions of Asian people. Encourage mutual understanding and empathy, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or reinforcing damaging power dynamics.
5. Celebrate the resilience and diversity of Asian cultures: Acknowledge the rich history and cultural heritage of Asian communities, including their struggles
