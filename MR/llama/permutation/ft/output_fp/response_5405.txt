Creating more inclusive community events for native Chinese speakers aged over 90 years old (or over 85 years old) requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this age group:

1. Language Support: Provide interpretation or translation services, either in-person or virtually, to ensure that all attendees can fully participate and understand the event's content. This will help bridge any language barriers and make the event more inclusive.
2. Accessibility Features: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible and has easy-to-navigate pathways, seating areas, and restrooms. Provide audio descriptions or tactile signage for visually impaired attendees to help them navigate the space.
3. Age-Friendly Activities: Plan activities that are suitable for seniors, such as chair yoga, trivia games, or cultural performances that are easy to follow and enjoyable for all ages. Avoid activities that may be too physically demanding or confusing for this age group.
4. Technology Support: Utilize technology to enhance the event experience, such as live-streaming or video conferencing to connect with remote attendees. This will allow seniors who may have difficulty traveling to attend the event remotely.
5. Social Interaction: Encourage social interaction among attendees by providing opportunities for mingling and networking. This can be done through organized group activities, such as game nights or cultural potlucks, where seniors can connect with each other and make new friends.
6. Health and Wellness Services: Offer health and wellness services, such as blood pressure checks, nutrition counseling, or physical therapy sessions, to promote senior health and well-being.
7. Volunteer Support: Recruit volunteers who can provide one-on-one support for seniors who may need help navigating the event or participating in activities. This can include assistance with mobility, communication, or other tasks that may be challenging for seniors.
8. Food and Beverage Options: Provide a variety of food and beverage options that cater to seniors' dietary needs and preferences
