There have been several successful advocacy efforts in recent years to expand and protect the rights of recent immigrants serving in the US military. Here are some notable examples:

1. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) Program: In 2016, the Pentagon launched the MAVNI program, which allowed non-citizens with critical skills to enlist in the US military and become eligible for citizenship through their service. The program was designed to address personnel shortages in certain specialties, such as medicine, engineering, and language translation. Advocacy efforts by immigrant rights groups and lawmakers helped ensure the program's continuation and expansion.
2. Dual Citizenship: In 2015, the US government passed legislation allowing immigrants who joined the military to retain their original citizenship while also obtaining US citizenship through naturalization. This legislation, known as the "Army Specialist" bill, was a result of advocacy efforts by immigrant rights groups and veterans' organizations.
3. Citizenship Pathway for Military Families: In 2019, the US government created a new citizenship pathway for the spouses and children of active-duty military personnel stationed abroad. This effort was made possible through advocacy by immigrant rights groups and lawmakers who recognized the challenges faced by military families living overseas.
4. Protection from Discrimination: Advocacy efforts have also focused on protecting the rights of immigrant service members and veterans from discrimination based on their immigration status. In 2017, the Department of Defense issued a directive prohibiting discrimination against service members based on their immigration status, and several states have enacted laws or executive orders to protect immigrant service members from discrimination in employment and housing.
5. Education and Training: Advocacy has also focused on ensuring that immigrant service members and veterans have access to education and training opportunities. For example, the US government offers language training and other educational resources to help immigrant service members succeed in their careers.
6. Legal Representation: Immigrant rights groups and legal aid organizations have also provided free or low-cost legal representation
