Creating more inclusive cultural events for devout Christian soft libertarians requires a thoughtful and respectful approach that takes into account their beliefs and values. Here are some suggestions on how to create such events:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite members of the Christian community to participate in the planning and organizing of the event. This will give them a sense of ownership and make them feel more invested in the outcome.
2. Be sensitive to their beliefs: Take into account their moral and ethical standards when selecting entertainment, food, and other aspects of the event. For example, avoid events that may be considered offensive or inappropriate according to their religious beliefs.
3. Provide a safe space for prayer: Offer a quiet area where participants can engage in private prayer or meditation without feeling uncomfortable or out of place.
4. Incorporate Christian themes and symbols: Use Christian symbols, such as crosses or Bible verses, in the event's decorations or programming. This will help create a sense of connection to their faith and culture.
5. Offer vegetarian options: Many Christians follow a vegetarian diet for religious reasons, so it's important to provide options that are respectful of their beliefs.
6. Be mindful of language: Avoid using language or jokes that may be offensive to Christian sensibilities. Use inclusive language and avoid making fun of their beliefs or practices.
7. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Create opportunities for participants from different religious backgrounds to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue. This can help build bridges of understanding and create a more harmonious atmosphere.
8. Provide educational resources: Offer materials or workshops that provide an overview of Christianity, its history, and its beliefs. This can help participants better understand the faith and its practices.
9. Showcase Christian art and music: Feature works of Christian art or music during the event, such as hymns, choral pieces, or visual representations of Christian themes.
10. Offer a variety of activities: Create a diverse range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences, including prayer services, workshops, lectures, and social events.
