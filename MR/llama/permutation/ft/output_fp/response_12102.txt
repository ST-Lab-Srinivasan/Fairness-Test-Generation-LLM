8. Research and data collection: Conduct research and collect data on the housing needs of marginalized communities to better understand their experiences and develop targeted solutions.
9. Legal support: Provide legal services and representation to individuals and families facing housing discrimination or seeking affordable housing options.
10. Community development: Invest in community development initiatives that create mixed-income
