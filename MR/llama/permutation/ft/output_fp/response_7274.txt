Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for beginner French speakers who are not able-bodied individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these celebrations more accessible and enjoyable for everyone:

1. Provide multiple access points: Offer different ways for people to participate, such as live streaming the event, providing closed captions or sign language interpretation, or offering pre-recorded content that can be accessed before or after the event.
2. Use accessible language: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Use simple and clear language that is easy to follow, even for those who are not fluent in French.
3. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, seating options, and accessible bathrooms. Make sure there is a clear path for people with mobility aids to navigate the space easily.
4. Incorporate different sensory experiences: Incorporate different sensory experiences into the celebration, such as tactile activities, visual displays, or auditory experiences. This can help create a more immersive and engaging experience for all participants.
5. Use inclusive marketing materials: Make sure any marketing materials are accessible to everyone, including those who may not be able to read or speak French. Use images, videos, and other visual aids to convey information and promote the event.
6. Provide support staff: Train volunteers or staff members to provide additional support to participants who may need it, such as helping them navigate the space or providing translation services.
7. Offer sensory-friendly activities: Incorporate activities that are sensory-friendly and enjoyable for everyone, such as tactile art projects, music performances, or storytelling sessions.
8. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Make sure the celebration creates a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of their abilities. Encourage participants to be respectful and considerate of each other's needs.
9. Offer adaptive technology: Provide adaptive technology, such as audio describers or braille displays, to help make the celebration more accessible for people with visual impairments.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate the accessibility of the celebration
