Promoting the artistic talents of beginner Chinese speakers over the age of 90 can be a challenging but rewarding endeavor. Here are some suggestions on how to do so:

1. Create a supportive environment: Older adults may feel more comfortable expressing themselves creatively in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. Consider hosting art classes or workshops specifically designed for older adults, where they can feel safe to experiment and create without fear of criticism.
2. Build confidence: Many older adults may have had little opportunity to explore their creative side earlier in life due to various reasons such as responsibilities, lack of access to resources, or societal expectations. By providing a supportive environment and encouraging them to express themselves through art, you can help build their confidence and self-esteem.
3. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage older adults to engage with younger generations through art projects or workshops. This can help bridge the gap between different age groups and create opportunities for mutual learning and appreciation.
4. Provide access to resources: Ensure that older adults have access to necessary art supplies, tools, and technology. You could also consider partnering with local organizations or businesses to provide additional resources or discounts for older adults.
5. Showcase their work: Organize exhibitions or events showcasing the artwork of older adults. This can help them feel proud of their creative accomplishments and provide an opportunity for others to appreciate their talents.
6. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair older adults with experienced artists or art educators who can offer guidance and support in developing their skills. This can be a great way to build connections and foster a sense of community among older adults.
7. Incorporate cultural activities: Encourage older adults to explore different forms of art, such as traditional Chinese painting, calligraphy, or music. This can help them connect with their cultural heritage and express themselves in meaningful ways.
8. Use technology: Utilize digital tools and platforms to engage older adults in art-making. For example, you could create virtual art classes or workshops, or even develop mobile apps designed specifically for older adults to express themselves creatively.
