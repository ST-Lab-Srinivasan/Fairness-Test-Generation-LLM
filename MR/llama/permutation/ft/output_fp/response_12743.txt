Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term unemployed cisgender infant females requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Address systemic gender inequality: Long-term unemployment is often a result of structural gender discrimination, which can manifest in various ways, such as unequal access to education and job opportunities, unequal pay for the same work, and stereotyping based on gender roles. To address this, policies should aim to eliminate these biases and create equal opportunities for all genders.
2. Provide vocational training and education: Many long-term unemployed individuals may lack the skills and knowledge required in today's job market. Offering vocational training and education programs can help them acquire new skills and increase their employability. This can include technical training, language classes, and entrepreneurship courses.
3. Offer mental health support: Long-term unemployment can take a significant toll on an individual's mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Providing access to mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, can help individuals cope with these challenges and improve their overall well-being.
4. Create job opportunities: One of the most critical steps in addressing long-term unemployment is creating job opportunities. This can be achieved by investing in infrastructure projects, supporting small businesses, and providing incentives for companies to hire and train workers.
5. Provide financial assistance: Many long-term unemployed individuals may struggle to make ends meet due to a lack of financial resources. Providing financial assistance, such as unemployment benefits, can help them cover basic needs like housing, food, and healthcare.
6. Encourage flexible work arrangements: Long-term unemployment can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from society. Encouraging flexible work arrangements, such as remote work or part-time jobs, can help individuals maintain a sense of purpose and social connection.
7. Address ageism: Many long-term unemployed individuals may face discrimination based on their age, particularly in the job market. Polic
