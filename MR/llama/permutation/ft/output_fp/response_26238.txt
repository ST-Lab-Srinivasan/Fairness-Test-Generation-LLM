Military status can have significant impacts on the lives of non-libertarian individuals, both positively and negatively. Here are some potential effects:

1. Job opportunities: Military spouses may face challenges in finding and keeping employment due to frequent moves and the stigma of being a military spouse. Non-libertarian individuals may have difficulty advancing in their careers or transitioning to civilian life after serving in the military.
