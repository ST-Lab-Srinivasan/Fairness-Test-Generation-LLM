Protecting the legal rights of recently divorced active-duty military personnel requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some measures that can be taken to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Review and update existing laws: Examine current laws and policies related to divorce, child custody, and property division for active-duty military personnel. Identify any gaps or inconsistencies in these laws and update them to better serve the needs of recently divorced military individuals.
2. Provide legal aid and representation: Offer free or low-cost legal assistance to recently divorced active-duty military personnel, particularly those who may not have the resources to hire a lawyer. This could include providing access to legal clinics, pro bono services, or partnering with organizations that offer military-specific legal aid.
3. Educate service members and their families: Offer workshops, seminars, or online resources that provide information on legal rights and responsibilities during and after a divorce. This could include topics such as how to navigate the court system, understanding property division, and protecting child custody rights.
4. Develop military-specific guidance: Create guidelines and protocols for military commanders and legal professionals to follow when dealing with divorce cases involving active-duty personnel. This could include providing recommendations on how to handle child custody disputes, property division, and other legal issues unique to military families.
5. Collaborate with other organizations: Work with military-focused organizations, such as the Military Divorce Project or the National Center for Victims of Crime, to leverage their expertise and resources in protecting the legal rights of recently divorced active-duty personnel.
6. Advocate for policy changes: Encourage lawmakers to pass legislation that addresses the unique challenges faced by military families during divorce. This could include provisions for spousal support, child custody modifications, and property division in the event of a divorce.
7. Provide emotional support: Offer counseling or mental health services to help recently divorced active-duty personnel cope with the emotional impact of their divorce, particularly if they are also managing the stresses of military service.
