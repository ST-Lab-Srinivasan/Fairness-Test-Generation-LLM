Creating more inclusive community events for native English speakers in the 90+ age group requires careful planning and consideration of their needs, preferences, and limitations. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and enjoyable for this demographic:

1. Choose venues and activities that are easily accessible:
	* Select locations with ample parking, wheelchair accessibility, and well-lit pathways.
	* Avoid events held in small, cramped spaces or those that require a lot of walking.
2. Provide transportation options:
	* Offer shuttle services or coordinate with local transportation providers to ensure easy pickup and drop-off points.
	* Consider partnering with local ride-sharing services to provide additional transportation support.
3. Use visual aids and verbal descriptions:
	* Provide written materials, such as agendas or flyers, in large print or braille for those with vision impairments.
	* Offer live interpreters or closed captioning for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals.
4. Cater to cognitive and sensory needs:
	* Use simple language and short attention spans when communicating information.
	* Provide sensory-friendly environments, such as reducing noise levels or using calming scents.
5. Offer flexible seating options:
	* Provide comfortable seating with adequate leg room and back support.
	* Consider adding ergonomic chairs or cushions for added comfort.
6. Schedule events during daylight hours:
	* Avoid holding events during the evening or late night, as it may be challenging for older adults to navigate in low light conditions.
7. Encourage social interaction:
	* Arrange group activities that encourage mingling and socialization, such as game nights or potlucks.
	* Use technology, like video conferencing, to connect with individuals who may be unable to attend in-person events.
8. Provide opportunities for physical activity:
	* Incorporate gentle exercise routines or walking breaks into the event schedule.
	* Offer adaptive sports equipment or modified activities for those with mobility limitations.
