Discrimination can have significant and profound impacts on the mental health of natural-born Canadian citizen permanent resident people. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: Discrimination can lead to chronic stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact mental health. The constant feeling of being judged or excluded can cause feelings of isolation and loneliness, leading to depression and anxiety disorders.
2. Lowered self-esteem: Discrimination can make individuals feel worthless, unimportant, or inferior, leading to lowered self-esteem and a loss of identity. This can result in negative body image, self-doubt, and decreased confidence.
3. Difficulty coping with trauma: Natural disasters, political instability, or other traumatic events can have a profound impact on the mental health of permanent residents. Discrimination can exacerbate these effects by adding an additional layer of stress and anxiety.
4. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social isolation as individuals may avoid social situations or interactions due to feelings of insecurity or fear of rejection. This can result in a lack of social support networks, which are essential for good mental health.
5. Difficulty accessing mental health resources: Permanent residents may face barriers when seeking mental health resources due to language or cultural barriers, lack of knowledge about available services, or fear of stigma. This can result in delayed access to care or inadequate treatment.
6. Stigma and shame: Discrimination can lead to feelings of shame and stigma, which can negatively impact mental health. Individuals may internalize the negative messages they receive and feel unworthy of respect or support from others.
7. Difficulty adjusting to a new environment: Permanent residents may face challenges adapting to a new cultural context, leading to feelings of disorientation and confusion. This can result in anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
8. Lack of sense of belonging: Discrimination can create a lack of sense of belonging, which is essential for good mental health. Individuals may feel disconnected from their communities and society as a whole, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection.
