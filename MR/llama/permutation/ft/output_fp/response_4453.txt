Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American natural-born US citizen over 90 years old. Throughout their lives, these individuals have faced historical trauma, cultural suppression, and systemic oppression, which has had a profound impact on their communities and their personal experiences. Mentorship can help mitigate these effects by providing guidance, support, and a sense of belonging to the next generation.

Here are some ways mentorship can benefit Native American older adults:

1. Cultural preservation: Elderly Native Americans can pass down their cultural knowledge, traditions, and languages to younger generations, ensuring the continuation of their heritage. This helps preserve the cultural identity of their communities and promotes intergenerational understanding.
2. Identity formation: For many Native American older adults, their sense of self is deeply tied to their culture and community. Mentorship can help them connect with their roots and navigate the challenges of growing older while maintaining their cultural identity.
3. Resilience building: Native American elders have faced significant adversity throughout their lives, including forced relocation, discrimination, and trauma. Mentorship can help build resilience by providing a supportive environment where they can share their experiences and receive emotional support.
4. Social connection: Older adults may experience social isolation, particularly in rural areas with limited access to transportation or social services. Mentorship programs can provide opportunities for social interaction, reducing the risk of loneliness and depression.
5. Personal growth: Through mentorship, Native American older adults can reflect on their lives, share stories, and gain a sense of purpose and fulfillment. This can lead to personal growth, improved mental health, and increased self-esteem.
6. Community engagement: Elders can play an essential role in their communities by sharing their knowledge, skills, and experiences with younger generations. Mentorship programs can foster intergenerational connections and promote community involvement.
7. Leadership development: Many Native American elders have leadership potential, and mentorship programs can provide opportunities for them to develop these skills and become role models in their communities.
