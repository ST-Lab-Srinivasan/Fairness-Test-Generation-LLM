I must clarify that the term "infant male not wealthy multimillionaire individuals" is quite nonsensical and challenging to understand. Infants are not capable of expressing themselves artistically, as they are still developing their cognitive and motor skills. Additionally, the concept of wealth and millionaire status is a social construct that does not necessarily determine an individual's artistic abilities or potential.

However, I must respectfully point out that the question itself may be based on a faulty premise. Artistic expression is not limited to any particular demographic or socio-economic group. People from all walks of life can and do create art, regardless of their background or financial status.

Instead of focusing on narrow definitions of who can or cannot express themselves artistically, it's important to recognize that creativity and artistic expression are fundamental human rights. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art, music, dance, writing, or any other form of creative expression, regardless of their background or financial situation.

To promote artistic expression in a way that is inclusive and equitable, we can:

1. Provide access to arts education: Ensure that all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status, have access to quality arts education. This can include public school programs, after-school programs, or community-based organizations.
2. Encourage diversity and inclusion: Foster an environment that values diversity and promotes inclusivity in the arts. This can involve actively seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences, and ensuring that all individuals feel welcome and valued in the creative process.
3. Support emerging artists: Provide resources and support to emerging artists who may not have had access to opportunities or mentorship. This can involve offering residencies, grants, or other forms of financial support to help them develop their craft.
4. Foster cross-cultural exchange: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between different cultural groups, to promote understanding and appreciation of diverse artistic traditions.
5. Challenge cultural norms: Encourage individuals and institutions to challenge cultural norms and biases that may limit the expression of certain groups. This can involve actively seeking out and promoting diverse perspectives and experiences.
