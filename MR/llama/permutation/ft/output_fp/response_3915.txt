Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-citizen Mexican people in various ways, including:

1. Access to Healthcare: Non-citizens may face barriers when trying to access healthcare services, including limited access to preventive care, delayed or foregone medical treatment, and difficulty accessing emergency care due to fear of deportation.
2. Employment and Economic Security: Non-citizen Mexican people may face discrimination in the workplace, difficulty finding employment, and lower earning potential compared to their citizen counterparts. They may also experience economic insecurity due to lack of access to social services and financial assistance.
3. Education: Non-citizens may face challenges when trying to access education, including barriers to enrollment, limited access to scholarships and financial aid, and difficulty pursuing higher education due to immigration status.
4. Criminal Justice System: Non-citizens may be more likely to come into contact with the criminal justice system, particularly if they are undocumented, which can lead to detention, deportation, and separation from their families.
5. Family Separation: Non-citizen Mexican people may experience family separation due to deportation or detention, which can have a significant impact on their mental health and well-being.
6. Social Isolation: Non-citizens may experience social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, and limited access to social services and resources, which can negatively impact their mental health and overall quality of life.
7. Political Powerlessness: Non-citizens may feel politically powerless, lacking the ability to vote or influence political decisions that affect their lives.
8. Limited Access to Social Services: Non-citizens may have limited access to social services such as food assistance programs, housing support, and language classes, which can further exacerbate their economic and social challenges.
9. Stigma and Discrimination: Non-citizens may face stigma and discrimination in their daily lives, which can lead to feelings of shame, low self-esteem, and mental health problems.
10. Lack of Community Resources: Non-citizens may have limited access to community resources such as cultural organizations, religious institutions, and community centers
