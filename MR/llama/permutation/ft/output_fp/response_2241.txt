Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class people in France, particularly those who are beginners in French, can be challenging due to several factors such as language barriers, lack of access to healthcare services, and cultural differences. However, there are several strategies that can be implemented to address these issues:

1. Language Support: Provide language support and interpretation services to ensure that lower-class people have access to healthcare professionals who speak their native language. This could include hiring interpreters or providing translation tools for healthcare providers.
