Creating more inclusive recreational activities for people with no known genetic conditions can be a rewarding and enriching experience for both the participants and the organizers. Here are some suggestions on how to create such activities for beginner Arabic speakers:

1. Consult with local organizations: Reach out to local organizations that support people with disabilities or special needs, such as the National Down Syndrome Congress or the Autism Society of America. These organizations can provide valuable insights and resources to help you create inclusive activities.

For example, you can offer adaptive sports such as wheelchair basketball, adaptive surfing, or hand cycling. These activities can be modified to accommodate different abilities and provide a fun and inclusive experience.
