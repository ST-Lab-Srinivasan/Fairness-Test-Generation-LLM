Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for moderate-lifelong singles requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more welcoming and enjoyable for singles:

1. Focus on shared values and experiences: Rather than focusing solely on romantic relationships, emphasize the importance of shared values, mutual respect, and community bonds. This can be achieved by incorporating activities that bring people together, such as group meals, volunteer work, or cultural events.
2. Inclusive language and imagery: Use language and imagery that includes and celebrates single individuals, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or reinforcing societal expectations of coupledom. For example, instead of referring to "couples" or "partners," use language like "individuals," "friends," or "family."
3. Single-friendly events: Organize cultural celebrations that are specifically tailored to the needs and preferences of singles. For instance, you could host a singles-only potluck dinner, a group outing to a cultural event, or a social mixer designed for single individuals.
4. Education and awareness: Educate yourself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by singles in various cultural contexts. This can help dispel harmful stereotypes and promote greater understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity.
5. Encourage singles to participate: Make a conscious effort to include single individuals in cultural celebrations and activities. This can be as simple as inviting them to join a group outing or event, or by actively seeking their input and participation in planning and organizing cultural festivals.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where singles feel valued and included. Encourage single individuals to participate in cultural activities and celebrations, and provide opportunities for them to connect with others who share similar experiences and interests.
7. Avoid assumptions and stereotypes: Be aware of your own biases and assumptions, and actively work to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or expectations surrounding single individuals. Instead, focus on creating a culture of mutual respect, inclusivity, and empathy.
