Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-traditional, non-long-time married individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural celebrations more welcoming:

1. Recognize the diversity of relationships: Acknowledge that not everyone is in a traditional marriage or has been married for an extended period. Embrace the diversity of relationship models, such as cohabitation, polyamory, or single parenthood.
2. Involve all family members: Encourage the inclusion of all family members, regardless of their relationship status. For example, if you're celebrating a cultural holiday like Diwali, invite your partner's family and friends, even if they are not in a traditional marriage.
3. Provide alternative options: Offer non-traditional relationship options when providing food, drinks, or other festival necessities. For instance, instead of only offering married couples wine or champagne, offer a variety of beverages that cater to everyone's preferences.
4. Emphasize inclusivity in decorations: When decorating for cultural celebrations, consider using decorations that reflect the diversity of relationship models. For example, you could use images of different types of families or relationships, such as single parents, blended families, or non-traditional partnerships.
5. Avoid assumptions: Be mindful of making assumptions about people's relationship statuses. Instead of assuming everyone is married or in a traditional relationship, ask each person how they identify and what they would like to participate in.
6. Create spaces for all: Ensure that your cultural celebrations are inclusive by creating physical and social spaces for everyone. This can involve setting up separate areas for different types of relationships or offering activities that cater to diverse needs and preferences.
7. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by non-traditional relationship models. Share this knowledge with others to create a more empathetic and inclusive environment.
8. Encourage participation: Make sure that everyone feels included in the celebration by encouraging participation from all family members, regardless of their relationship status. Provide opportunities for everyone to contribute to the cultural celebration in meaningful ways.
9. Be mindful of language:
