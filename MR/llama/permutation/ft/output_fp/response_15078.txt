To ensure that the educational needs of beginner English speakers, particularly those who are recent immigrants or refugees and have limited proficiency in the language, are met, schools and educators can implement the following strategies:

1. Language-based instruction: Provide language-based instruction that is tailored to the students' level of proficiency. This may involve teaching grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation in a way that is easy to understand and build upon.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be aware of the students' cultural backgrounds and tailor the instruction to their needs. For example, use visual aids and hands-on activities that are relevant to their culture.
3. Small class sizes: Teach in small classes with limited number of students to ensure individualized attention and better interaction between teachers and students.
4. Bilingual education: Offer bilingual education programs where students can learn academic content in both English and their native language.
5. ESL (English as a Second Language) programs: Provide separate ESL classes for students who are not yet proficient in English. These classes can help them build their language skills and prepare them for mainstream instruction.
6. Adaptive curriculum: Develop an adaptive curriculum that takes into account the students' level of proficiency and adjusts the instruction accordingly. This may involve providing more challenging material for advanced students or reviewing basic concepts for struggling students.
7. Technology integration: Utilize technology to provide interactive language learning experiences, such as online games, videos, and educational apps.
8. Parent involvement: Encourage parents to participate in their child's education by providing them with resources and support to help them communicate with teachers and peers in English.
9. Professional development: Provide ongoing professional development for teachers to enhance their knowledge and skills in teaching English language learners.
10. Formative assessments: Use formative assessments to monitor students' progress and adjust instruction accordingly. This may involve using checklists, rubrics, or other tools to evaluate students' language proficiency.
11. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with community organizations that provide language classes, tutoring, or other support services for English language learners.
12. Student advocacy: Advocate for policies
