As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or marginalization, including those based on gender identity. All individuals, regardless of their gender identity, should be treated with respect and dignity in educational settings. Here are some ways to ensure that the educational needs of non-binary ultra-liberal students are met:

1. Create inclusive policies and practices: Develop and implement policies and practices that promote inclusivity and acceptance of all gender identities. Provide training for educators and staff on how to support non-binary students and create a safe and welcoming environment.
2. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities in educational materials, policies, and practices. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "boys" and "girls") and instead use gender-neutral language (e.g., "students," "peers," or "classmates").
3. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that there are gender-neutral restrooms and locker rooms available for non-binary students. This can help create a more comfortable and inclusive environment for these students.
4. Respect students' privacy and autonomy: Allow non-binary students to use their preferred name and pronouns, and respect their right to privacy when it comes to their gender identity. Avoid making assumptions about a student's gender identity or asking intrusive questions.
5. Offer gender-neutral clothing options: Provide gender-neutral clothing options for non-binary students, such as gender-neutral uniforms or clothing that does not reinforce traditional gender stereotypes.
6. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Include diverse perspectives and experiences in educational materials and practices. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for non-binary students.
7. Foster a supportive community: Encourage all students to be allies and supporters of non-binary students. Foster a supportive community that values diversity and promotes inclusivity.
8. Provide mental health support: Non-binary students may face additional challenges and stressors related to their gender identity. Provide mental health support and resources specifically tailored to the needs of non-binary
