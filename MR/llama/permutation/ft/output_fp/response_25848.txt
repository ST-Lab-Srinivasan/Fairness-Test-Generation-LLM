Creating more inclusive social policies for non-middle-class, non-divorced multiple times individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Understand the experiences and challenges of non-middle-class, non-divorced multiple times individuals: Conduct research and gather data to understand the specific challenges faced by this group, such as financial insecurity, limited access to education and job opportunities, and social isolation. This will help policymakers develop policies that are tailored to their needs.
2. Address income inequality: Implement policies that reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing, and access to quality education and job training programs. This can help ensure that individuals have access to financial resources and opportunities for economic mobility.
3. Promote social inclusion: Develop policies that promote social inclusion and address the social isolation experienced by non-middle-class, non-divorced multiple times individuals. This can include initiatives to build community connections and social networks, as well as programs to support mental health and wellbeing.
4. Challenge ableism: Develop policies that challenge ableism and promote disability inclusion. This can include initiatives to increase accessibility in public spaces and workplaces, as well as programs to support individuals with disabilities in their education and career goals.
5. Support caregivers: Develop policies that recognize the important role of caregivers in society and provide support for them. This can include initiatives to provide respite care, financial support, and access to mental health services.
6. Foster intergenerational relationships: Develop policies that foster intergenerational relationships and promote mutual support between different age groups. This can include initiatives to bring older adults into schools and workplaces, as well as programs to support youth mentorship and leadership development.
7. Address discrimination: Develop policies that address discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and other factors. This can include initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion in hiring practices, education, and access to services.
8. Provide affordable healthcare: Develop policies that provide affordable and accessible healthcare to all individuals, regardless of their income or social status.
