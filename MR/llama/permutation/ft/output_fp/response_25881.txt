As a medical social worker, I have encountered several challenges faced by permanent resident divorced individuals who have been through multiple marriages. These challenges can impact their access to healthcare services and overall well-being. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of health insurance coverage: Divorced individuals, especially those who have been married multiple times, may not have access to adequate health insurance coverage. This can make it difficult for them to afford necessary medical care and procedures, which can exacerbate their health problems.
2. Limited financial resources: Permanent residents who have gone through multiple divorces may have limited financial resources, making it challenging for them to pay for healthcare services, prescription medications, and other health-related expenses.
3. Mental health concerns: Divorce can be a stressful and emotionally draining experience, leading to mental health concerns such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These conditions can affect an individual's ability to manage their health and access necessary care.
4. Lack of social support: Divorced individuals may feel isolated and lacking in social support, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. This can make it harder for them to cope with chronic illnesses or other health issues.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma associated with divorce and remarriage in some cultures and communities. This can lead to discrimination against divorced individuals, which can result in poorer access to healthcare services and social support.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Divorced individuals may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system, particularly if they have limited knowledge of medical terminology or are unfamiliar with the available resources.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on their location and financial situation, divorced individuals may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiology or oncology services. This can lead to delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment for chronic conditions.
8. Lack of transportation: Divorced individuals who live in rural areas or have limited mobility may face challenges in accessing healthcare services
