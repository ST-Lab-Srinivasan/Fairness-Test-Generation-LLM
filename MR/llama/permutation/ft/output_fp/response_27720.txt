However, there are several steps that can be taken to address these challenges and ensure that their healthcare needs are met:

1. Provide interpreter services: Many recent immigrants may not speak the local language fluently, which can create a barrier in accessing healthcare services. Providing interpreter services, such as translators or audio/video remote interpreting, can help bridge this gap and ensure that patients receive accurate diagnoses and treatment.
