As a policymaker, there are several legislative changes that could potentially benefit Native American reservist communities:

1. Expansion of VA Healthcare Services: Providing access to quality healthcare is crucial for the well-being and prosperity of Native American communities. The VA could work with tribal leaders to establish healthcare clinics or partnerships on reservations, ensuring that Native Americans have access to culturally competent care.
