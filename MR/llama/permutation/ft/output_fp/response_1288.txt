Highlighting the issues faced by recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who are living above the poverty line, can be done through various data-driven methods. Here are some suggestions:

1. Analyze demographic data: Use census data or other surveys to understand the demographics of recent immigrants, including their age, gender, education level, and occupation. This can help identify specific groups that may be facing unique challenges. For example, you might find that recently arrived immigrants with lower levels of education are more likely to experience poverty than those with higher levels of education.
2. Examine economic data: Look at data on income, wealth, and access to financial resources for recent immigrants. This can help identify disparities in financial stability and opportunities for entrepreneurship or career advancement. For example, you might find that recent immigrants have lower levels of wealth than the native-born population, making it more difficult for them to access credit or invest in their own businesses.
3. Study health outcomes: Use data on health insurance coverage, access to healthcare services, and health disparities to understand the health outcomes of recent immigrants.

For example, you might find that recently arrived immigrants have lower levels of health insurance coverage than the native-born population, making it more difficult for them to access preventive care or manage chronic conditions.

For example, you might find that recently arrived immigrants have lower levels of educational attainment than the native-born population, making it more difficult for them to access higher-paying jobs or opportunities for career advancement.

This can help identify areas with high concentrations of immigrant populations and potential service gaps or disparities. For example, you might find that recently arrived immigrants are
