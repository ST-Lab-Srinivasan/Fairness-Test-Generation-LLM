Supporting beginner Spanish speakers over the age of 90 can be challenging, but there are several effective strategies that can help. Here are some ideas:

1. Use technology to your advantage: Older adults may have difficulty with traditional language learning methods, such as textbooks or classroom instruction. Consider using technology-based resources like language learning apps, online courses, or interactive games to engage them in the learning process.
2. Focus on practical communication: While grammar and vocabulary are important, it's also essential to teach practical communication skills. Encourage learners to use Spanish in real-life situations, such as ordering food at a restaurant or shopping at a store.
3. Use visual aids: Older adults may have difficulty processing auditory information, so using visual aids like pictures, flashcards, or videos can be helpful.
4. Encourage peer learning: Pair older adult learners with younger learners who are also beginners. This can provide an opportunity for both groups to learn from each other and practice speaking in a low-pressure setting.
5. Provide opportunities for social interaction: Language learning is often more effective when it's accompanied by opportunities for social interaction. Consider organizing cultural events or language exchange activities where older adult learners can interact with native speakers.
6. Offer individualized attention: Older adults may have different learning styles and needs, so it's important to offer individualized attention and adapt teaching methods accordingly.
7. Foster a supportive learning environment: Encourage a supportive and respectful learning environment where older adult learners feel comfortable making mistakes and asking questions.
8. Provide opportunities for creative expression: Older adults may find it more enjoyable to learn a language through creative activities like writing, drawing, or singing. Consider incorporating these types of activities into language lessons.
9. Use storytelling techniques: Older adults often have rich life experiences that can be leveraged for language learning. Encourage them to share stories and anecdotes in Spanish, and provide feedback and support as they practice the language.
10. Celebrate progress and milestones: Learning a new language can be challenging, so it's important to celebrate small victories and milestones
