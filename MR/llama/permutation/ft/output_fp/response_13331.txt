Promoting the educational success of native Spanish-speaking mentally disabled students requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competency: Ensure that teachers and staff are culturally competent in working with students from diverse backgrounds, including those with mental disabilities. This includes understanding the student's culture, values, and beliefs, and incorporating them into the educational process.
