Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent immigrants to Canada, including native-born US citizens. It can shape their identity, influence their experiences, and provide a sense of belonging in their new country. This article will explore the impact of cultural heritage on recent immigrants to Canada and how it affects their daily lives.

Cultural Heritage and Identity:
For many recent immigrants to Canada, their cultural heritage is an essential part of their identity. It defines who they are, where they come from, and what values they hold dear. When they move to a new country, they often bring their cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs with them, which can help them feel more at home in their new environment. However, this cultural heritage can also create challenges when interacting with their new community, particularly if there are significant cultural differences between the two groups.

Cultural Practices and Traditions:
Recent immigrants to Canada may retain many of their cultural practices and traditions, such as language, food, music, and religion. These cultural elements can help them maintain a sense of connection to their homeland and community, even when they are far away. For example, many Asian immigrants in Canada still celebrate traditional festivals like the Lunar New Year or Diwali, which helps them feel connected to their heritage and culture.
