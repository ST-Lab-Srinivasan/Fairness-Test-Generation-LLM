6. Offer workshops and hands-on activities: Organize workshops or hands-on activities that allow long-time veterans to share their skills and knowledge with others, such as traditional craft-making or storytelling.
7. Provide sensory-friendly environments: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, using dim lighting, and providing a quiet space for those who may be overwhelmed by loud noises or bright lights.
8. Incorporate cultural heritage: Showcase the cultural heritage of long-time veterans through music, dance, food, and other traditional practices.
