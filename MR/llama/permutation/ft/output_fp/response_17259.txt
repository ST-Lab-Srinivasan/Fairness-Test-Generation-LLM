The impact of immigration status on the lives of long-time married people in their first trimester of pregnancy can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Stress and anxiety: The uncertainty and unpredictability of immigration status can create a constant state of stress and anxiety for both the migrant and their partner. This can negatively impact their mental health and overall well-being during a crucial time in their pregnancy.
2. Healthcare access: Undocumented migrants may face barriers in accessing proper prenatal care, which can lead to delayed or inadequate medical attention during critical moments of the pregnancy. This can result in poorer health outcomes for both the mother and the baby.
3. Financial strain: Immigration status can limit access to financial resources, making it challenging for migrants to cover the costs of prenatal care, hospital bills, and other expenses associated with pregnancy and childbirth. This can lead to increased financial stress and insecurity.
4. Social isolation: Migrants may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their support networks. This can have a profound impact on their mental health and overall well-being during pregnancy.
5. Fear of deportation: The constant fear of deportation can lead to heightened anxiety and stress for migrants, which can negatively affect their mental and physical health during pregnancy. This fear can also make it challenging for them to seek medical attention or access resources for proper prenatal care.
6. Lack of legal rights: Undocumented migrants may face legal barriers that limit their access to essential services, such as healthcare and education. This can further exacerbate the challenges they face during pregnancy.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Migrants may experience discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization. This can have a profound impact on their mental health and overall well-being during pregnancy.
8. Lack of community support: Migrants may struggle to connect with their local communities due to language barriers or cultural differences,
