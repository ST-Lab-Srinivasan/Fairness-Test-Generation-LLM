Addressing the needs of individuals who are just above the poverty line in disaster response requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their specific circumstances and vulnerabilities. Here are some strategies that can be employed to address their needs:

1. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building programs for these individuals to help them develop skills in disaster response, such as first aid, emergency preparedness, and search and rescue techniques. This will enable them to better respond to disasters and provide support to their communities.
2. Access to Resources: Ensure that these individuals have access to resources such as food, water, shelter, and medical supplies before and after a disaster. This can be done through partnerships with local organizations and government agencies.
3. Community-based Approach: Implement a community-based approach to disaster response, where these individuals are involved in the planning and implementation of disaster response strategies. This will help to build their confidence and skills in responding to disasters, while also ensuring that the response is culturally appropriate and sensitive to the needs of the community.
4. Inclusive Communication: Ensure that communication during disaster response is inclusive and accessible to all individuals, including those who are just above the poverty line. This can be achieved through the use of simple language, visual aids, and multiple channels of communication.
5. Livelihood Support: Provide support to these individuals in terms of livelihood opportunities, such as microfinance programs or vocational training, to help them rebuild their lives and become more resilient to disasters.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that address the root causes of poverty and inequality, which can increase vulnerability to disasters. This can include initiatives such as social safety nets, affordable housing, and access to basic services.
7. Community-based Early Warning Systems: Establish community-based early warning systems that are tailored to the specific needs of these individuals. This can include the use of simple messaging apps, radio broadcasts, or other forms of communication that are accessible to all members of the community.
8. Inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction: Implement disaster risk reduction strategies that are inclusive and take into account the specific needs of these individuals
