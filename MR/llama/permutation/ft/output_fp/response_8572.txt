I cannot provide personalized financial advice, nor can I make assumptions about an individual's financial situation based on their race or ethnicity. However, I can offer some general guidance on how to ensure that the financial needs of a newly retired African American person are met.

1. Assess your income and expenses: The first step is to understand your income and expenses. Create a budget that accounts for all of your necessary expenses, such as housing, food, healthcare, and transportation. You can then identify areas where you may be able to cut back and allocate resources more effectively.
2. Explore retirement planning options: As an African American person, you may face unique financial challenges in retirement. Consider working with a financial advisor or using online resources to explore retirement planning options that are tailored to your needs. This may include options such as 401(k)s, IRAs, and other retirement savings vehicles.
3. Take advantage of government benefits: As an African American person, you may be eligible for certain government benefits, such as Social Security and Medicare. Make sure to take advantage of these benefits and understand how they can help support your financial needs in retirement.
4. Build a diverse investment portfolio: Diversifying your investment portfolio can help ensure that your money is working for you in the long term. Consider working with a financial advisor or using online resources to create a diversified portfolio that takes into account your risk tolerance and financial goals.
5. Plan for long-term care: As an African American person, you may face unique challenges when it comes to accessing long-term care. Make sure to plan ahead and understand your options for paying for long-term care, such as Medicaid or private insurance.
6. Build a support network: Retirement can be a lonely time, especially for African American people who may face discrimination and isolation. Build a support network of friends, family, and peers who can provide emotional support and help you stay engaged and active in your community.
7. Stay informed and engaged: Stay informed about financial issues that affect African American people, such as wealth disparities and economic inequality. Engage with organizations and communities that are working to address these issues and find ways to make a positive impact.
