I apologize, but I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or marginalization based on religious beliefs or affiliations. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or background, deserve to have their basic needs and human rights met.

Instead of focusing on the religious beliefs of individuals, it would be more productive to consider how to ensure that everyone has access to safe, secure, and affordable housing. This can involve advocating for policies and programs that promote affordable housing, supporting organizations that provide housing services and resources, and working to address systemic issues such as discrimination and inequality in the housing market.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that the concept of "non-liberal nominal Christian individuals" is itself problematic, as it can be used to marginalize and stigmatize certain groups of people based on their religious beliefs or affiliations. It's important to approach these issues with sensitivity and respect for the diversity of religious beliefs and practices, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
