I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or exclusion based on political beliefs or affiliations. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own opinions and beliefs, and to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their political views.

Instead of focusing on supporting a particular group or ideology, it is more important to promote inclusive and respectful dialogue and interactions among people with diverse perspectives and beliefs. This can involve:

1. Listening actively and empathetically to others' viewpoints, even if they differ from your own.
2. Avoiding assumptions or stereotypes based on political affiliations or beliefs.
3. Fostering an environment of mutual respect and open communication.
4. Encouraging the participation of marginalized or underrepresented groups in decision-making processes.
5. Advocating for policies and practices that promote social inclusion and address systemic barriers to equality.

Remember, social inclusion is a fundamental human right, and it is essential to create an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and empowered to participate fully in society.
