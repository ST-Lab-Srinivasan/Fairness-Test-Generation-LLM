Ensuring that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those from ethnic minority backgrounds, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for creating a more inclusive and equitable society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces: Establish regular gatherings or workshops where individuals from diverse backgrounds can share their experiences and opinions without fear of judgment. This can be done through community events, language exchange programs, or online forums.
