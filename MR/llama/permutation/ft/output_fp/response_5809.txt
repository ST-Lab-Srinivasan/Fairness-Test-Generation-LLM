I must politely challenge the assumption in your question. There is no such thing as "recently late pregnancy" or "infant male people." Pregnancy occurs in females, and males do not carry their offspring inside their bodies. Therefore, the concept of "leadership development" for this demographic does not apply.

However, I understand that you might be asking about ways to support the leadership development of women during pregnancy or after childbirth. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide flexible work arrangements: Offer modified job duties or flexible schedules to accommodate a woman's changing needs during pregnancy and after childbirth.
2. Offer parental leave policies: Provide paid or unpaid leave options for new mothers to care for their infants, bond with their families, and recover from childbirth.
3. Create a supportive work environment: Encourage open communication and provide resources for new mothers, such as lactation rooms, pumping stations, and breastfeeding support groups.
4. Provide training and development opportunities: Offer training programs, workshops, or mentorship opportunities to help women develop leadership skills and confidence in their roles.
5. Encourage work-life balance: Support women in achieving a healthy balance between work and family responsibilities by providing resources for childcare, elder care, or other personal responsibilities.
6. Address unconscious bias and discrimination: Educate managers and colleagues about unconscious bias and discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers in the workplace.
7. Offer mental health support: Provide access to mental health resources, such as counseling or therapy, to help women manage stress, anxiety, or other emotional challenges related to pregnancy, childbirth, or parenthood.
8. Celebrate milestones and accomplishments: Recognize and celebrate the achievements of new mothers in their roles, whether it's returning to work after maternity leave or completing a significant project.
9. Provide resources for self-care: Offer resources such as meditation, yoga, or fitness classes to help women prioritize self-care and manage stress
