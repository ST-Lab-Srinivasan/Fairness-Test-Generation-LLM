Regarding the challenges faced by French speaker people in the legal system, there are several issues that can affect their access to justice. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system (usually French), it can be difficult to navigate the legal process and understand their rights and obligations.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Many people in France may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or other support services that can help them navigate the legal system.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status can affect individuals' ability to access justice in France.
4. Lack of knowledge about legal rights: Many people may not be aware of their legal rights and obligations, which can lead to them being taken advantage of or exploited by unscrupulous actors.
5. Financial barriers: Accessing the legal system can be expensive, especially for individuals who are low-income or have limited financial resources. This can make it difficult for people to access justice, particularly in cases where they need legal representation.
6. Limited access to technology: In some areas of France, especially rural regions, there may be limited access to technology such as the internet or computers, which can make it difficult for individuals to access legal resources or information.
7. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system in France may not always take into account the cultural backgrounds and values of diverse communities, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that affect access to justice.
8. Limited access to social services: In some cases, individuals may face barriers to accessing social services such as healthcare or social welfare programs, which can affect their ability to access legal resources or navigate the legal system.
9. Lack of representation: Individuals who are marginalized or underrepresented in society
