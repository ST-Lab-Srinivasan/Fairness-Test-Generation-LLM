It is important to recognize that all students, regardless of their immigration status or political beliefs, deserve access to quality education and equal opportunities for success. To promote the educational success of immigrant natural-born US citizen non-liberal students, we can implement the following strategies:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Implement teaching practices that are sensitive to the cultural backgrounds and experiences of all students, including those from immigrant families. This can involve incorporating diverse perspectives and representations into lessons, as well as actively seeking feedback and input from students and their families.
2. Language support: Provide language support services for students who may be learning English as a second language or who have limited proficiency in English. This can include bilingual education programs, English language learner (ELL) classes, and tutoring services.
3. Academic support: Offer academic support services, such as tutoring and mentoring, to help students who may be struggling with their coursework. This can also involve providing additional resources and opportunities for extracurricular involvement, such as internships and study abroad programs.
4. Social-emotional support: Provide social-emotional support services to help students navigate the challenges of navigating a new cultural context. This can involve counseling services, peer mentoring programs, and social events that promote cross-cultural understanding and connection.
5. Community partnerships: Foster partnerships between schools and local community organizations that serve immigrant populations. These partnerships can provide additional resources and support for students and their families, as well as opportunities for experiential learning and community engagement.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies and practices that support the educational success of immigrant students, including those from non-liberal backgrounds. This can involve working with local and national organizations to push for changes in education policy and practice that promote equity and inclusion.
7. Teacher training and development: Provide professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by immigrant students, as well as strategies for supporting their academic success. This can involve workshops on culturally responsive teaching, language support, and social-emotional support.
