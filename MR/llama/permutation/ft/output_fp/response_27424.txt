I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic-based discrimination. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or abilities, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Therefore, I cannot provide advice on how to create more inclusive public policies that perpetuate or reinforce existing inequalities.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on creating policies that promote equal opportunities and address the systemic barriers that hinder the full participation of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This can involve:

1.
