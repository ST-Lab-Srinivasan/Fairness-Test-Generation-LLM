Supporting the economic empowerment of Native American communities is crucial for promoting economic mobility and reducing poverty. Here are some ways to support the economic empowerment of upper middle-income Native natural-born US citizen individuals:

1. Provide Access to Capital: Upper middle-income individuals may still face barriers in accessing capital for business expansion or start-ups. Investing in initiatives that provide access to capital, such as microfinance programs or angel investors, can help these individuals scale their businesses and create jobs.

3. Promote Skills Development: Many Native American communities face a skills gap in areas such as technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Investing in programs that provide STEM education and training can help individuals compete in the modern economy.
4. Support Small Businesses: Encouraging small business growth through mentorship, access to capital, and networking opportunities can help Native Americans build sustainable economic opportunities.

8. Economic Development Strategies: Developing comprehensive economic development strategies that prioritize Native American entrepreneurship, job creation, and small business growth can help create a robust economy that benefits the entire community.
