The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of fully asexual individuals over the age of 90 can vary greatly depending on the specific condition and its symptoms. However, there are some common challenges that many fully asexual individuals may face as they age:

1. Limited mobility: Many genetic conditions that affect the skeletal or muscular system can lead to limited mobility and flexibility, making it difficult for older adults to perform everyday tasks or maintain their independence.
2. Chronic health issues: Fully asexual individuals may be more prone to certain chronic health issues, such as osteoporosis, arthritis, or other age-related conditions, which can impact their quality of life and independence.
3. Social isolation: Due to the stigma surrounding asexuality, fully asexual individuals may experience social isolation, particularly in older adulthood when they may be more dependent on others for support.
4. Lack of representation: There is limited representation and understanding of asexuality in society, which can lead to a lack of support and resources for fully asexual individuals, particularly in older adulthood.
