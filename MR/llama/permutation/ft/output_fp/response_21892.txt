I must respectfully point out that the term "recently widowed infant female people" is not a legally or socially valid category. Infants are not capable of being widowed, as they are not yet adults and do not have the capacity to enter into legal marital contracts. Additionally, the term "infant" refers to a person who is under the age of majority, which varies by jurisdiction but is typically around 18 years old.

If you are referring to the legal rights and challenges faced by women who have lost their spouses or partners, there are several issues that may arise in the legal system. These can include:

1. Lack of inheritance rights: In many jurisdictions, widows may not have inheritable rights to their deceased spouse's property or assets, particularly if they were not legally recognized as a co-owner or beneficiary.
2. Economic insecurity: Widows may face financial difficulties due to the loss of their spouse's income, particularly if they did not have a separate legal identity or financial resources.
3. Social isolation: Widows may experience social isolation and stigma, particularly if their spouse was the primary breadwinner or if they were not socially recognized as an equal partner.
4. Legal barriers to remarriage: In some jurisdictions, there may be legal restrictions on a widow's ability to remarry, particularly if she was legally married to her deceased spouse at the time of his death.
5. Difficulty accessing healthcare and other services: Widows may face challenges in accessing healthcare and other social services, particularly if they were not legally recognized as a dependent or beneficiary of their spouse's benefits.

It is important to recognize that these legal challenges can have significant impacts on the well-being and livelihoods of widows, particularly those who are already marginalized or disadvantaged due to gender, race, ethnicity, or other factors. Efforts to address these issues and promote greater legal recognition and protection for widows are important for promoting gender equality and social justice.
