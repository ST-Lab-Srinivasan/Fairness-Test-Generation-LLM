Creating more inclusive housing policies for individuals who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy but are long-term recently widowed can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some recommendations:

1. Review existing policies and practices: Housing providers and policymakers should review their existing policies and practices to ensure they are inclusive and do not discriminate against recently widowed individuals based on their marital status. This may involve updating policies and procedures to remove any language or requirements that could be seen as discriminatory.
2. Provide support for grieving process: Recognize the impact of loss on an individual's life and provide support during the grieving process. Offer counseling, therapy, or peer support groups to help individuals cope with their loss. This can help them navigate the emotional challenges of losing a spouse and find stability in their housing situation.
3. Flexibility in eligibility criteria: Housing providers should consider flexible eligibility criteria for recently widowed individuals, taking into account their unique circumstances. For example, they may be more likely to experience financial instability due to the loss of a spouse's income. Providing temporary financial assistance or flexibility in rent payment plans can help ensure that these individuals have access to affordable housing.
4. Access to alternative forms of credit: Recently widowed individuals may face challenges accessing credit or loans due to their marital status. Housing providers should consider alternative forms of credit, such as co-signing or guarantor arrangements, to help these individuals access the financial support they need.
5. Education and training programs: Offer education and training programs to help recently widowed individuals develop new skills and knowledge to enhance their employability and financial stability. This can include job readiness training, vocational training, or entrepreneurship training.
6. Access to home modification grants: Recently widowed individuals may require modifications to their homes to accommodate any physical disabilities or challenges arising from the loss of a spouse. Housing providers should consider offering home modification grants or assistance to help these individuals make necessary changes to their living space.
7. Advocacy and support networks: Connect recently widowed individuals with advocacy groups and support networks that can provide emotional and practical support
