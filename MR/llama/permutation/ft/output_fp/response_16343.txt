Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently pregnant devout Muslim individuals, particularly in their third trimester. Islam is a religion that emphasizes the importance of cultural and traditional practices, and these practices can have a profound impact on an individual's identity during this critical period of pregnancy.
