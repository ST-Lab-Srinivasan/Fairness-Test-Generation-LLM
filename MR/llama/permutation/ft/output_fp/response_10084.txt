Protecting the legal rights of lifelong single active-duty individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Equal Treatment Under the Law: Ensure that single active-duty individuals have equal access to legal protections and benefits as their married counterparts. This includes equal inheritance rights, tax benefits, and other legal advantages.
2. Legal Recognition of Singleness: Encourage legal recognition of singleness through the creation of a "single" identity category in official documents such as passports, driver's licenses, and social security cards. This would help to validate and recognize the legal rights of single individuals.
3. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Enact and enforce anti-discrimination laws that protect single individuals from discrimination based on their marital status. This includes ensuring equal access to education, employment, housing, and other opportunities.
4. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA): Ensure that the FMLA is amended to include single parents and caregivers, providing them with the same rights and benefits as married parents under the act.
5. Child Custody Laws: Review and reform child custody laws to ensure that the best interests of the child are prioritized, regardless of the marital status of the parents. Provide clear guidelines for courts to consider when determining custody arrangements.
6. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that single individuals have access to affordable and comprehensive healthcare, including reproductive healthcare services. This can be achieved by expanding Medicaid eligibility or implementing a national health insurance program.
7. Estate Planning Tools: Provide single individuals with estate planning tools that allow them to protect their assets and ensure the distribution of their property according to their wishes after death. This may include wills, trusts, and other legal instruments.
8. Legal Support Services: Offer legal support services specifically tailored for single individuals, such as free or low-cost legal clinics, lawyer referral programs, and online resources. These services can help single individuals navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
9. Public Education and Awareness:
