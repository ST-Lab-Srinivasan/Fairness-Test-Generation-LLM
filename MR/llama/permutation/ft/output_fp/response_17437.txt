Divorced, multiple times recently undocumented individuals face a range of challenges when interacting with the legal system. Some of the specific issues they may encounter include:

1. Lack of legal representation: Due to their immigration status, these individuals may not have access to legal aid or representation, making it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the legal system.
2. Language barriers: Many undocumented individuals may face language barriers when interacting with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals, which can hinder their ability to understand and participate in legal proceedings.
3. Fear of deportation: The threat of deportation can be a significant factor for undocumented individuals, particularly those who have been divorced multiple times. This fear can make it difficult for them to seek legal advice or advocacy, as they may be afraid of being reported to immigration authorities.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Undocumented individuals may not have access to the same legal resources as documented individuals, such as legal clinics or pro bono services. This can make it difficult for them to obtain the legal advice and support they need.
5. Discrimination: Undocumented individuals may face discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are dealing with issues related to divorce, child custody, or other family law matters. This discrimination can result in unequal treatment under the law and make it difficult for them to access justice.
6. Lack of understanding of their rights: Undocumented individuals may be unaware of their legal rights and responsibilities, particularly if they are not fluent in the language of the legal system. This lack of understanding can lead to unfair treatment and discrimination.
7. Fear of seeking justice: Due to their immigration status, undocumented individuals may be hesitant to seek legal remedies or advocacy, fearing that it could lead to deportation or other negative consequences.
8. Limited access to social services: Undocumented individuals may have limited access to social services, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities, which can make it difficult for them to obtain the support they need to navigate the legal system.
9. Stigma and discrimination: Undocumented individuals may face stigma and discrimination in their communities,
