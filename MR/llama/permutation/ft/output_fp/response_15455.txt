There is limited research on the impact of military status on the lives of non- newly married individuals over the age of 90. However, based on available literature and studies, here are some potential impacts:

1. Life Experience: Individuals who have served in the military may have a unique perspective on life due to their experiences in the military. They may have witnessed or participated in significant historical events, which could shape their worldview and values.
2. Social Isolation: Older individuals who are no longer newly married may experience social isolation, particularly if they live alone. Military status may exacerbate this issue as older veterans may feel disconnected from civilian society due to their military experiences and lingering feelings of loyalty towards their fellow service members.
3. Mental Health: Military service can have a profound impact on mental health, particularly for those who experienced traumatic events during their service. Older veterans may be more susceptible to mental health issues such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety due to the accumulation of stressors over time.
4. Physical Health: Military service can also have a significant impact on physical health, particularly for those who served in combat zones or experienced exposure to hazardous materials during their service. Older veterans may experience a range of physical health issues related to their military service, including chronic pain, mobility problems, and respiratory issues.
5. Financial Security: Military service can provide financial security through benefits such as the GI Bill and VA pensions. However, older veterans may face challenges in maintaining their financial stability due to factors such as declining health, reduced mobility, and limited access to employment opportunities.
6. Community Support: Older veterans may experience a lack of community support due to the distance between themselves and their military peers. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from society, particularly if they do not have immediate family or social networks available for support.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding mental health issues and military service in some parts of society. Older veterans may face discrimination or negative attitudes towards their military status, which can further exacerbate feelings of isolation and marginalization.
