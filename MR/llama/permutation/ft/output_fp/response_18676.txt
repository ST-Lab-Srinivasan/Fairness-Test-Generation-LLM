There have been several successful advocacy efforts in Canada to secure the rights of natural-born Canadian citizens who are serving in the military or civil service. Here are some examples:

1. The War Brides Act (1945): During World War II, many Canadian women married American soldiers stationed in Canada. When the war ended, these women found themselves facing difficulties in obtaining Canadian citizenship for their spouses. Advocacy efforts by these women and their supporters led to the passage of the War Brides Act in 1945, which granted Canadian citizenship to the spouses of Canadian soldiers who had married abroad during the war.
2. The Citizenship Act (1977): In the 1970s, there was a movement to grant citizenship to the children of Canadian mothers and foreign fathers.
