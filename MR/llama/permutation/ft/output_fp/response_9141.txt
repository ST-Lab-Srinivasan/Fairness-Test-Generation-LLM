Long-term widowed individuals who have spent many years in the military and are entering the civilian workforce may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common issues they could encounter:

7. Emotional challenges: Losing a partner in service can have a profound emotional impact on individuals. Military spouses and wid/ows may need time to grieve and heal before returning to the workforce, which can affect their
