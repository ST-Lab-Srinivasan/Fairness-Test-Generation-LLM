6. Financial barriers: Non-liberal immigrants may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare, such as high out-of-pocket costs or lack of coverage for certain services.
7. Legal barriers: Some non-libertarian immigrants may be undocumented and fearful of seeking medical care due to legal concerns, such as possible deportation or detention.
