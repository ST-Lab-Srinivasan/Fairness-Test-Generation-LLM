Creating more inclusive community events for recent immigrants in their mid-50s in Canada requires understanding their needs, interests, and cultural backgrounds. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and engaging:

1. Language support: Provide language support during the event by offering interpretation or translation services. This can help immigrants who may not be fluent in English or French to participate and enjoy the event.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and traditions when planning the event. Avoid activities that may be offensive or insensitive to specific cultures. Involve members of the immigrant community in the planning process to ensure cultural sensitivity.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, audio descriptions, or sign language interpretation.
4. Diverse programming: Offer a diverse range of activities and programs that cater to different interests and hobbies. This can include cultural performances, workshops, and lectures that reflect the diversity of the immigrant community.
5. Inclusive marketing: Use language and marketing materials that are inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid stereotyping or tokenizing specific groups, and instead emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusion.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for immigrants to get involved in the planning and execution of the event. This can help them feel more connected to the community and build their confidence in navigating Canadian society.
7. Food options: Offer food options that are culturally appropriate and accessible to people with dietary restrictions. This can include halal or kosher options, as well as gluten-free or vegan alternatives.
8. Technology support: Provide technology support during the event, such as Wi-Fi access or language translation apps. This can help immigrants who may not be familiar with technology to participate and enjoy the event.
9. Childcare: Offer childcare services or activities for children during the event. This can help parents feel more comfortable attending and participating in the event, knowing that their children are well cared for.
10. Community building: Focus on building a sense of community
