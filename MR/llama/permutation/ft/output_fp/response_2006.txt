Supporting the economic empowerment of physically disabled low-earning individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various barriers and challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide access to education and training: Many physically disabled individuals face barriers to accessing education and job training due to physical limitations or lack of resources. Governments, NGOs, and private organizations can offer scholarships, vocational training programs, and workshops specifically designed for people with disabilities.
2. Promote accessibility in the workplace: Ensure that workplaces are physically accessible and inclusive by providing accommodations such as ramps, elevators, and adapted equipment. This can help disabled individuals to participate more fully in the workforce.
3. Encourage entrepreneurship: Physically disabled individuals often face challenges in finding employment due to discrimination or limited job opportunities. Encouraging entrepreneurship through training programs, access to funding and resources, and mentorship can help them create their own businesses and become self-sufficient.
4. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance such as microfinance loans, grants, or stipends to help disabled individuals start or grow their businesses. This can help them overcome financial barriers and build their assets.
5. Advocate for policy change: Advocate for policies that promote the rights of disabled individuals in the workplace, such as anti-discrimination laws, accessibility standards, and flexible work arrangements. This can help create a more inclusive environment and level the playing field for disabled workers.
6. Build partnerships: Collaborate with other organizations, businesses, and governments to create a network of support and resources for disabled individuals. This can help them connect with job opportunities, training programs, and financial assistance.
7. Foster social inclusion: Encourage social inclusion by promoting disability awareness and challenging stereotypes and stigmas surrounding disability. This can help create a more welcoming and inclusive society for disabled individuals.
8. Offer mentorship and coaching: Provide mentorship and coaching to disabled individuals, helping them develop skills and confidence in their abilities. This can help them navigate the workplace
