Creating more inclusive housing policies for non-traditional households, such as those consisting of lifelong singles or individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, can be achieved through a number of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Review and modify existing policies: Housing policies often have strict eligibility criteria that may exclude certain groups, such as single parents or individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy. Reviewing and modifying these policies to make them more inclusive can help ensure that everyone has access to safe and affordable housing.
2. Offer flexible payment options: Many singles and pregnant individuals may struggle to afford housing due to financial constraints. Offering flexible payment options, such as rent subsidies or payment plans, can help make housing more accessible to these groups.
3. Provide support for single parents: Single parents often face additional challenges when it comes to affording housing. Providing support for single parents, such as access to affordable childcare or financial assistance, can help them better manage their household expenses and find stable housing.
4. Create mixed-income housing communities: Mixed-income housing communities bring together individuals from different income levels in the same neighborhood. This can help create a more inclusive and diverse community, where everyone has access to affordable housing options.
5. Offer temporary or transitional housing: Individuals who are in their third trimester of pregnancy or recently single may need temporary or transitional housing as they navigate this life change. Providing access to short-term housing options can help them get back on their feet more quickly.
6. Provide case management services: Case management services can help individuals connect with resources and support services that can aid in their housing search. This can include help finding affordable housing, accessing financial assistance, or connecting with job training programs.
7. Involve community members in the decision-making process: Involving community members in the decision-making process around housing policies can help ensure that the needs and perspectives of diverse groups are taken into account. This can help create more inclusive policies that benefit everyone.
8. Use a housing first approach: A housing first approach prioritizes providing permanent housing to individuals as quickly as possible, and then providing support services to help them maintain that housing. This approach recognizes that stable housing is essential
