Every individual has the right to self-identify and express their own unique identity, without judgment or expectations from others.

It is important to recognize that sexuality and gender identity are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simple categorizations such as "ultra-conservative" or "actively slightly bisexual." People's identities are shaped by a variety of factors, including their personal experiences, cultural background, and social environment.

It is also important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals from diverse backgrounds. However, it is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's identity based on their cultural heritage or political beliefs.

In conclusion, it is essential to respect and recognize the diversity of human experience and identity, and to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on limited information.
