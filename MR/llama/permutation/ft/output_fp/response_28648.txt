Supporting nominal Muslims, particularly those who have recently reached the age of 65 or older (and in some cases, over the age of 85), can be challenging due to various factors such as physical limitations, cognitive decline, and social isolation. Here are some effective strategies for supporting these communities:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Reach out to the elderly Muslims in your community through various means such as phone calls, visits, or organized events. Encourage them to participate in community activities, and provide transportation or other logistical support if needed.
2. Education and Training: Offer educational programs or training sessions on topics relevant to the elderly Muslims, such as Islamic studies, Arabic language, or health and wellness. This can help them stay mentally active and engaged with their faith and community.
3. Social Activities: Organize social events or activities that cater to the elderly Muslims, such as potlucks, picnics, or intergenerational events where they can interact with younger members of the community. This can help combat loneliness and social isolation.

5. Financial Support: Offer financial assistance or resources to help elderly Muslims cover basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. This can be done through donations or by establishing a fund specifically for this purpose.

7. Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness about the needs and challenges faced by elderly Muslims within the broader community. Advocate for their rights and interests, and work with local authorities to address any issues or concerns.
8. Technology Integration: Utilize technology to reach out to elderly Muslims who may be isolated or have difficulty accessing services. This can include video conferencing, online classes or training, or
