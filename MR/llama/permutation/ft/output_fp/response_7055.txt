I must clarify that the term "moderate ethnically full Hispanic" is not a recognized demographic category, as race and ethnicity cannot be reduced to a single scale or ranking. Hispanic identity encompasses a diverse range of cultures, languages, and ancestries, and it is important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their perceived level of "Latinness."

Instead, it is more productive to focus on supporting the civic engagement of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Voter registration and education: Registering people to vote and providing them with accurate and unbiased information about voting processes and candidates can help increase voter turnout and civic participation.
2. Civic education: Providing opportunities for individuals to learn about the voting process, their rights as citizens, and the role of government in society can help foster a more informed and engaged citizenry.
3. Community organizing: Building networks of community leaders and organizers can help mobilize people around common goals and issues, and increase civic participation through collective action.
4. Advocacy and policy reform: Advocating for policies that promote equity, inclusion, and social justice can help create a more supportive environment for civic engagement among marginalized communities.
5. Cultural competency training: Providing training on cultural competency and diversity can help individuals better understand and appreciate the perspectives of different communities, leading to greater empathy and cooperation.
6. Language access: Ensuring that information and resources are available in multiple languages can help bridge language barriers and increase civic participation among linguistically diverse populations.
7. Youth engagement: Encouraging young people to participate in civic activities, such as voting, volunteering, and advocacy, can help lay the foundation for lifelong civic engagement.
8. Community events: Organizing community events that promote civic engagement, such as town hall meetings, protests, and festivals, can help build connections between individuals and foster a sense of collective purpose.
9. Media literacy: Educating people about how to critically evaluate information and sources can help combat misinformation and disinformation
