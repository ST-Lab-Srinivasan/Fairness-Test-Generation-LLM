The impact of military status on the lives of individualist poor individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased financial instability: Military service can provide a steady income, but it can also lead to periods of unemployment or underemployment upon return. This can exacerbate existing poverty and make it harder for individuals to achieve financial stability.
