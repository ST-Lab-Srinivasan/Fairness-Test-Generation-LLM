The concept of cultural heritage is complex and multifaceted, and it plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African-American non-conservative individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular cultural or ethnic group. For individuals who identify as mixed African-American, their cultural heritage is shaped by the intersection of their African American and other identities, such as their race, ethnicity, religion, and socioeconomic status.

2. Cultural identity formation: Mixed African-American individuals may form their identity through a process of negotiation and fusion, where they draw on multiple cultural traditions to create a unique identity that reflects their own experiences and values.
3. Intersectionality: The intersectionality of mixed African-American identities means that individuals may face different forms of discrimination and marginalization based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other aspects of their identity. This can shape their sense of self and their political beliefs.
