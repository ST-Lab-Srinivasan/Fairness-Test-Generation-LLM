Promoting the educational success of Native American recent immigrants to the US and moderate-liberal students requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that educators, policymakers, and community leaders can adopt:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers in culturally responsive teaching practices that recognize the importance of Native American culture and identity. This includes incorporating Indigenous knowledge and perspectives into the curriculum, using Indigenous language and imagery, and creating a safe and inclusive learning environment.
2. Trauma-informed care: Provide trauma-informed care that acknowledges the historical trauma and ongoing systemic oppression faced by Native American communities. This includes understanding the impact of trauma on students' academic performance, providing mental health services and support, and creating a healing-centered learning environment.
3. Bilingual education: Offer bilingual education programs that prioritize Indigenous languages and cultures. This can include language immersion programs, dual-language instruction, and community-based language revitalization initiatives.
4. Indigenous knowledge integration: Integrate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives into curriculum development and teaching practices. This includes incorporating traditional ecological knowledge, cultural practices, and spiritual beliefs into science, math, and other subjects.
5. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with Native American communities, organizations, and elders to co-create educational programs and resources that are culturally responsive and relevant to students' lives. This can include community-based learning projects, mentorship programs, and cultural events.
6. Indigenous student leadership: Encourage and support Indigenous student leaders by providing opportunities for them to take on leadership roles within the school or community. This can help build their confidence, skills, and sense of belonging.
7. Anti-racism education: Provide anti-racism education that addresses the systemic racism and discrimination faced by Native American students. This includes teaching about the history and impact of colonization, forced assimilation, and ongoing oppression, as well as strategies for combating racism and promoting social justice.
8. Parent and community engagement: Engage with parents and the broader community
