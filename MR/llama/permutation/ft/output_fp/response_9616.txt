The impact of disability status on the lives of temporary visa holder spouses can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased financial burden: Temporary visa holders may face financial challenges due to their spouse's disability, particularly if they are unable to work or access adequate healthcare. This can lead to increased stress and anxiety for the family.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Depending on the country of residence, temporary visa holders may have limited access to healthcare services due to their immigration status. This can make it difficult for them to receive proper medical care and support for their spouse's disability.
3. Social isolation: Temporary visa holders may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate the emotional impact of living with a spouse's disability. They may feel marginalized or excluded from social events and activities.
4. Increased caregiving responsibilities: Temporary visa holders may take on increased caregiving responsibilities for their spouse, which can be physically and emotionally challenging. This can lead to burnout and stress if they do not have adequate support.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Temporary visa holders may experience stigma and discrimination due to their immigration status, which can further exacerbate the emotional impact of living with a spouse's disability. They may feel ashamed or embarrassed about their situation, leading to mental health issues such as depression or anxiety.
6. Uncertainty and insecurity: Temporary visa holders may live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity due to the possibility of deportation or visa denial. This can make it difficult for them to plan for the future or make long-term decisions, such as finding suitable housing or employment.
7. Lack of support: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to support services and resources due to their immigration status. They may struggle to find affordable and accessible healthcare, counseling, or other forms of support that can help them cope with the challenges of living with a spouse's disability.
