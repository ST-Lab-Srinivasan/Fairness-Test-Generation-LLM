The impact of immigration status on the lives of people in their third trimester of pregnancy, who are long-time married and happy, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during pregnancy, including language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, and fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Fear and Stress: Living with an uncertain immigration status can cause significant stress and anxiety, which can affect the pregnant person's overall well-being and their ability to manage their pregnancy. This fear can also lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, making it difficult for them to seek support from friends, family, or healthcare providers.
3. Limited Access to Support Services: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges when accessing support services during pregnancy, such as prenatal care, childbirth classes, and postpartum care. They may also struggle to find affordable housing, food assistance programs, and other resources that can help them navigate the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood.
4. Financial Strains: Pregnancy and parenthood can be costly, and undocumented immigrants may face financial strains due to limited access to healthcare, education, and other resources. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness, which can affect their mental and emotional well-being during pregnancy.
5. Lack of Legal Protections: Undocumented immigrants may be at risk of exploitation or abuse during pregnancy, as they may be unable to access legal protections against discrimination or neglect. This can lead to unsafe working conditions, lack of access to adequate healthcare, and other challenges that can affect their well-being and the health of their baby.
6. Separation from Family: Undocumented immigrants may face separation from their spouse or other family members due to immigration status, which can have significant emotional and psychological impacts during pregnancy. This can lead to feelings of loneliness
