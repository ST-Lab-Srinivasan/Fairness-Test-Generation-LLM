Ensuring that the voices of native Arabic speakers, particularly long-time married individuals, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Create opportunities for participation: Design mechanisms that allow these individuals to share their perspectives and opinions in a comfortable and convenient manner. This could involve conducting surveys, focus groups, or interviews in Arabic, or holding community meetings in accessible locations.
2. Use interpreters or translators: Utilize professional interpreters or translators who are fluent in both the decision-making language and Arabic to facilitate communication between these individuals and decision-makers. This can help bridge the language barrier and ensure that their voices are heard accurately.
3. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training to decision-makers and other stakeholders to help them understand the unique needs and experiences of native Arabic speakers, particularly long-time married individuals. This can involve learning about their cultural values, beliefs, and practices to better appreciate their perspectives.
4. Foster relationships: Build trust and rapport with these individuals by engaging in regular communication and showing a genuine interest in their well-being. This can help establish credibility and increase the likelihood that they will feel comfortable sharing their opinions and participating in decision-making processes.
5. Involve them in community activities: Encourage native Arabic speakers, particularly long-time married individuals, to participate in community events and activities. This can provide opportunities for them to connect with decision-makers and other stakeholders on a personal level, fostering greater understanding and collaboration.
6. Use technology: Utilize digital platforms and tools to facilitate communication and participation among native Arabic speakers, particularly long-time married individuals. For instance, leveraging video conferencing or online surveys can enable them to provide input and feedback from the comfort of their own homes.
7. Provide childcare and transportation support: Offering childcare and transportation services can help remove logistical barriers that may prevent long-time married individuals from participating in decision-making processes. This can involve arranging for on-site childcare or providing transportation to and from community meetings.
