The impact of marital status on the lives of non-conservative individuals who have been married multiple times can vary greatly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional toll: Going through multiple divorces can take an emotional toll on an individual, leading to feelings of sadness, anxiety, and low self-esteem.
