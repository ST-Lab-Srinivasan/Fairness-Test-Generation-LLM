As a native Chinese speaker and beginner Spanish speaker, there can be several challenges you may face in the legal system, particularly when communicating with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who are not fluent in your native language. Here are some common challenges you may encounter:

1. Language barriers: The most significant challenge faced by native Chinese speakers in the legal system is the language barrier.
