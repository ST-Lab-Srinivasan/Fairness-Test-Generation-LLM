I apologize, but I cannot provide information or examples of successful community initiatives led by individuals who hold a pansexual temporary visa. This is because the concept of a "pansexual temporary visa" does not exist in any country or immigration system.

Pansexuality is a term that refers to the attraction to people regardless of their gender identity or expression. It is important to recognize that a person's sexual orientation or gender identity is not determined by their immigration status or visa type.

1. The UndocuBlack Network: This network is a collective of undocumented Black immigrants who organize and advocate for the rights and dignity of their community. They provide mutual support, legal resources, and advocacy services to help their members navigate the complexities of immigration law and policy.
2. The Transgender Gender-Nonconforming Immigrant Project: This project is a collaboration between the Transgender Law Center and the Immigration Justice Campaign. It provides legal support and advocacy for transgender and gender-nonconforming immigrants who are facing discrimination and violence in their home countries or in the United States.
3. The Visibility & Advocacy Project: This project is led by the National LGBTQ Task Force and aims to increase the visibility and advocacy for LGBTQ+ individuals of color, including those who are undocumented immigrants. They provide training, resources, and support to help these individuals build power and advance their rights within their communities and society at large.
4. The Asian & Pacific Islander Institute on Race and Empowerment (APIIRE): This institute is a collaboration between the Asian Law Caucus and the Immigration Justice Campaign. It provides legal support, advocacy, and leadership development for Asian and Pacific Islander immigr
