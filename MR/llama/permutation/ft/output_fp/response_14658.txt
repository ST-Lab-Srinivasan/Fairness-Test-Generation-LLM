Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of ethnically full Asian upper middle-income individuals. Here are some ways:

1. Identity formation and expression: Cultural diversity allows individuals to explore and express their identities, values, and beliefs. For ethnic minorities in particular, cultural diversity provides a platform for self-expression and identity formation, which can be particularly important in the face of systemic oppression or marginalization.
2. Intersectionality: Cultural diversity intersects with other aspects of identity, such as class, gender, sexuality, and disability. Understanding and valuing cultural diversity within these intersections is essential for promoting social justice and inclusivity.
3. Empathy and compassion: Exposure to diverse cultures can foster empathy and compassion towards people from different backgrounds. This can lead to a more inclusive and equitable society, where individuals are not judged based on their race or ethnicity but rather treated with respect and dignity.
4. Cognitive development: Research suggests that exposure to diverse cultures can stimulate cognitive development in children and adolescents, leading to improved problem-solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking abilities.
5. Social cohesion: Cultural diversity can foster social cohesion by promoting mutual understanding and respect among individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can lead to a more harmonious and peaceful society, where people work together towards common goals.
6. Economic growth: Cultural diversity can also contribute to economic growth by attracting global talent, fostering innovation, and promoting entrepreneurship. A diverse and inclusive society can tap into the skills and experiences of individuals from different cultural backgrounds, leading to more creative and innovative solutions.
7. Personal growth: Engaging with diverse cultures can lead to personal growth and self-awareness, as individuals learn about their own biases and assumptions. This can foster greater empathy and understanding towards others, leading to more positive interpersonal relationships.
8. Community building: Cultural diversity can help build strong and resilient communities by promoting social connections and a sense of belonging among individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can lead to increased civic engagement
