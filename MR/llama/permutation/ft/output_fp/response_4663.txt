It is important to recognize that the experiences of individuals within a racial or ethnic group can vary greatly, and it is not accurate or fair to make generalizations about an entire group based on their race or ethnicity. However, I will do my best to provide some potential challenges faced by non-poor, ethnically full African Americans in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained in cultural competency, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between providers and patients. This can result in inadequate care or mistreatment of patients based on their cultural beliefs or practices.
2. Limited access to healthy food and exercise opportunities: In some communities, there may be limited access to healthy food options or safe places to exercise, which can contribute to health disparities.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race or ethnicity still exists in the healthcare system. Patients may face discrimination from providers or other patients, which can affect their overall well-being and ability to access quality care.
4. Limited representation in clinical trials: Clinical trials often do not include enough racial or ethnic minorities, which means that treatments may not be tailored to the needs of these populations. This can result in inadequate care or mistreatment based on a provider's assumptions about what is best for a particular group.
5. Stigma and shame: Patients may feel ashamed or embarrassed about their health issues, particularly if they are related to behaviors or conditions that are stigmatized in their community. This can make it difficult for them to seek care or disclose information to providers.
6. Limited English proficiency: In communities with limited English proficiency, patients may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
7. Limited transportation options: In some areas, there may be limited public transportation options, making it difficult for patients to access medical care, particularly if they do not have a driver's license or reliable transportation.
8. Limited health insurance coverage: Patients who are uninsured or underinsured may face challenges accessing preventive care,
