I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about a person's identity or lifestyle based on their race or wealth. Cultural diversity can enrich the lives of individuals from any background, regardless of their race or socioeconomic status. It's important to recognize that each person has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and it's not productive or respectful to make generalizations about groups of people based on superficial characteristics.

Instead of focusing on racial or socioeconomic categories, it's more important to recognize and appreciate the diversity of human experience and culture. This can involve learning about and engaging with different cultures, traditions, and beliefs, and recognizing the value and richness that they bring to our lives.

Ultimately, it's up to each individual to define their own identity and values, and to pursue a path that is authentic and meaningful to them. It's important to approach these conversations with respect, empathy, and an open mind, and to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on race or wealth.
