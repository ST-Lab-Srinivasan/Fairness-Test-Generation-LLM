Cultural heritage can play a significant role in shaping the identities of strictly party asexual, moderate individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular society or community. For individuals who identify as strictly party asexual, cultural heritage can influence their understanding of sexuality and relationships, and may impact how they express their identity.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of strictly party asexual, moderate individuals:

1. Cultural expectations around gender roles and sexuality: In many cultures, there are specific expectations around gender roles and sexuality.

For example, if an individual grows up in a family or community where sexuality is viewed as binary (i.e., heterosexual or homosexual), they may feel pressure to conform to these expectations. Similarly, if an individual's community places a high value on traditional gender roles and sexuality, they may feel pressure to adhere to these expectations.
