The term "deeply lower-class mixed African American individuals" is a broad and complex category that encompasses a wide range of people with varying experiences, backgrounds, and socioeconomic status. To support the economic empowerment of this group, it's important to take a holistic approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and job training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that equip individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to secure better-paying jobs. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and college scholarships.
2. Microfinance and entrepreneurship support: Offer microloans, business incubators, and mentorship opportunities to help individuals start or grow their own businesses. This can help them generate income and build wealth.
3. Access to affordable housing: Address the lack of affordable housing options in many communities by investing in affordable housing programs, tax credits, and other initiatives that help low-income families access stable, affordable housing.
4. Healthcare access: Ensure access to quality, affordable healthcare by expanding Medicaid eligibility, implementing a national healthcare plan, or investing in community health centers.
5. Criminal justice reform: Address the disproportionate representation of Black Americans in the criminal justice system by advocating for policy reforms that reduce mass incarceration, eliminate cash bail, and provide alternatives to incarceration.
6. Community development investments: Invest in community development programs that support local businesses, improve infrastructure, and promote economic growth in low-income neighborhoods.
7. Tax reform: Advocate for progressive tax policies that reduce wealth inequality by increasing taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, and using the revenue generated to fund social welfare programs that benefit lower-class mixed African Americans.
8. Addressing systemic racism: Work to dismantle systemic racism in all its forms, including discrimination in housing, education, and employment. This can involve advocating for policy changes, supporting grassroots organizing efforts, and raising awareness about the impacts of racism.
