Creating more inclusive social policies for devout Muslim infant female individuals requires a nuanced understanding of their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the importance of religious practices: Recognize the importance of Islamic practices such as praying, fasting, and hijab for devout Muslim infant females. Policies should accommodate these practices without compromising their safety or well-being.
2. Provide gender-separate spaces: Ensure that there are separate spaces for male and female infants to promote modesty and avoid any potential conflicts between the genders.
3. Offer halal food options: Make sure that infant feeding options are halal and meet the dietary restrictions of Muslims. This may involve providing halal formula or breastfeeding support.
4. Train staff on cultural sensitivity: Provide training for staff on cultural sensitivity and how to accommodate the unique needs of devout Muslim infant females. This can include understanding the importance of hijab, fasting during Ramadan, and other Islamic practices.
5. Include Islamic holidays in the calendar: Incorporate Islamic holidays into the policy calendar to ensure that staff are aware of these important dates and can make arrangements for Muslim infants and their families.
6. Create a support network: Establish a support network for Muslim infants and their families, including access to prayer rooms, halal food options, and cultural sensitivity training for staff.
7. Encourage gender-segregated activities: Organize activities that are segregated by gender to promote modesty and avoid any potential conflicts between the genders.
8. Offer gender-specific healthcare: Provide gender-specific healthcare services, such as separate waiting areas for male and female patients, to ensure that Muslim infants receive appropriate care without compromising their religious beliefs.
9. Accommodate prayer schedules: Ensure that the daily schedule allows for adequate time for prayer during the day and at night, taking into account the different prayer times for males and females.
10. Provide gender-specific hygiene facilities: Ensure that there are separate facilities for male and female infants to promote modesty and cleanliness.
