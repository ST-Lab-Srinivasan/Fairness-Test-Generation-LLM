Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American natural-born US citizens, including moderate liberals. Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and validation to individuals in various aspects of their lives, including personal, cultural, and political growth. Here are some ways mentorship can shape the development of Native American moderate liberals:

1. Cultural identity formation: Growing up, many Native American youth may face challenges in reconciling their cultural identities with their experiences in a predominantly non-Native society.

2. Political engagement: Moderate liberals often prioritize social justice and political activism. Mentorship can inspire and equip Native Americans to become involved in politics, advocating for policies that promote tribal sovereignty, cultural preservation, and social equity.
3. Leadership development: Effective mentorship can help Native American moderate liberals develop leadership skills, which are critical for advancing their communities' interests and addressing pressing issues such as environmental degradation, education disparities, and economic inequality.
