Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers from an upper-class background requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Language support: Provide language support during the event by offering interpreted or captioned content, or providing a designated area for attendees to ask questions in a private setting. This will help upper-class Spanish speakers who may not be comfortable speaking in public.
2. Accessibility features: Ensure that the event venue is wheelchair accessible and has amenities such as gender-neutral bathrooms, or provides accommodations for attendees with disabilities. This will make the event more inclusive for everyone.
3. Diverse programming: Offer a variety of activities and workshops that cater to different interests and learning styles. This could include cultural events, language exchange programs, or interactive activities that encourage participation from all attendees.
4. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage volunteers from diverse backgrounds to help with event logistics and programming. This will provide an opportunity for upper-class Spanish speakers to engage with the community and gain valuable experience.
5. Marketing strategies: Utilize marketing strategies that reach a diverse audience, such as social media campaigns targeted at different demographics or community outreach programs. This will help ensure that the event is well-attended by a broad range of participants.
6. Intersectional programming: Plan activities and workshops that address the intersectionality of language learning and social justice issues, such as cultural appropriation, racism, and gender inequality. This will create a more inclusive environment for attendees from diverse backgrounds.
7. Safe space policies: Establish safe space policies during the event to ensure that all attendees feel comfortable and included. This could include providing quiet spaces for attendees who need them, or designating specific areas for different activities.
8. Community building: Encourage community building through icebreaker activities or group discussions that foster connections among attendees from diverse backgrounds. This will help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity during the event.
9. Accessibility resources: Provide accessibility resources, such as audio descriptions or Braille materials
