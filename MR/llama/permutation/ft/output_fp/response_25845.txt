Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-class, non-recently widowed individuals requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach. Here are some key considerations and strategies to help achieve this goal:

1. Understand the needs and experiences of marginalized groups: To create inclusive policies, it's essential to understand the unique challenges and barriers faced by non-upper-class individuals. Conduct research, gather data, and engage with community members to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and identify areas where policies can be improved.
2. Address systemic inequalities: Many social policies are designed with the assumption that everyone has equal access to resources and opportunities. However, this is often not the case, particularly for marginalized groups. Policies should aim to address systemic inequalities by promoting equity and inclusion.
3. Focus on prevention rather than cure: Many social policies focus on providing support after a crisis occurs (e.g., after someone becomes homeless). However, it's important to invest in preventative measures that can help individuals avoid crises in the first place. This could involve providing affordable housing options, job training programs, and other resources that help people maintain stability and well-being.
4. Encourage community participation: Involving marginalized communities in policy-making processes can help ensure that policies are responsive to their needs and priorities. This could involve establishing community advisory groups or engaging in participatory budgeting processes.
5. Challenge power dynamics: Social policies are often shaped by dominant power structures, which can perpetuate inequality. Policies should challenge these power dynamics by promoting collaborative decision-making processes and encouraging diverse perspectives.
6. Prioritize long-term solutions: Many social policies are reactive, providing short-term fixes without addressing the root causes of social issues. Policies should prioritize long-term solutions that promote sustainable change and reduce the likelihood of crises occurring in the future.
7. Foster cross-sector collaboration: Social policies often involve multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, community organizations, and private sector actors. Collaboration across sectors can help ensure that policies are comprehensive and well-coordinated, leading to better outcomes
