The impact of military status on the lives of newly married individuals aged 65 and above can be significant, particularly for those who have served in the military for an extended period. Here are some potential effects:

1. Health issues: Military service can expose individuals to physical and mental health challenges, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. These conditions can impact their quality of life and ability to perform daily tasks, especially if they are married and have dependents.
2. Financial strain: Military pensions and benefits may not be sufficient to cover the costs of living, particularly for couples who have both retired from the military. They may struggle to make ends meet, leading to financial stress and sacrifices in their personal lives.
3. Social isolation: Military service can lead to social isolation, as individuals spend extended periods away from family and friends. This can impact their ability to form and maintain relationships with their spouses and other loved ones, particularly if they have been deployed multiple times.
4. Adjusting to civilian life: After serving in the military for many years, it can be challenging for individuals to adjust to civilian life. They may struggle to find employment or transition to a non-military career, leading to feelings of frustration and disorientation.
5. Coping with loss: Military service can involve experiencing loss, such as the loss of comrades in arms or the loss of loved ones due to deployment. This can impact an individual's ability to form and maintain relationships, particularly if they have experienced multiple losses.
6. Managing stress: Military service can be highly stressful, particularly during deployments. Individuals may struggle to manage their stress levels, leading to emotional and psychological challenges.
7. Navigating healthcare systems: Military veterans may face challenges navigating civilian healthcare systems, particularly if they have complex medical needs. This can impact their ability to access necessary care and services.
8. Legal and administrative challenges: Military veterans may encounter legal and administrative challenges when dealing with VA benefits, pensions, and other entitlements. These challenges can be time-consuming and stressful, particularly if they are also managing health issues.
9. Stigma and discrimination
