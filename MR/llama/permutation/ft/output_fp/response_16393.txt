Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for effectively serving diverse patient populations, including recently retired veterans and long-term unemployed individuals. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these groups:

1. Improved diagnosis and treatment: By understanding the cultural beliefs and practices of patients, healthcare providers can better identify symptoms and behaviors that may be related to underlying cultural values.
