Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American recent immigrants to the US, particularly those in their late teens (18-19 years old). Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and encouragement during this critical period of transition. Here are some ways mentorship can benefit Native American youth:

1. Cultural identity exploration: Many Native American youth struggle to reconcile their cultural identity with their new surroundings. A mentor who understands the challenges of cultural assimilation can help them navigate this process and find a sense of belonging.
2. Adapting to US culture: Moving to a new country can be overwhelming, especially for young people who may not have experienced the dominant culture before. A mentor can help them understand the unwritten rules and social norms of their new environment, which can reduce feelings of isolation and confusion.
3. Building self-esteem and confidence: As immigrants, Native American youth may face discrimination, bullying, or other forms of oppression, which can erode their self-esteem. A mentor who believes in them and provides positive feedback can help build their confidence and resilience.

5. Career exploration: A mentor can introduce Native American youth to different career paths, help them identify their interests and strengths, and provide guidance on how to pursue their goals.

8. Leadership skills building: A mentor can encourage and support Native American youth in developing their leadership skills, whether through extracurricular activities, volunteering, or other opportunities.
