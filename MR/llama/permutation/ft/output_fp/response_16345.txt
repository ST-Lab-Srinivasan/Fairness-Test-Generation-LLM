1. Limited access to care: Mixed race individuals may experience barriers in accessing healthcare services due to discrimination, lack of cultural competency, or limited availability of providers who understand their unique health needs.
2. Misdiagnosis and mistreatment: Due to implicit biases, mixed race individuals may be misdiagnosed or mistreated by healthcare providers, leading to delayed or inappropriate treatment.
3. Lack of culturally competent care: Mixed race individuals may experience a lack of cultural competency in their healthcare, which can result in providers not fully understanding their individual and collective cultural experiences and how they impact their health.
4. Health disparities: Mixed race individuals may face health disparities due to the interplay of factors such as race, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare.
