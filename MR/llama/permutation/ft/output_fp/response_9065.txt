Supporting the social inclusion of older adults, including those who are beginners in a new language like Chinese, is crucial for their overall well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of over 90 years old beginner Chinese speaker people:

1. Language classes: Offer language classes specifically designed for older adults, tailored to their needs and abilities. These classes can help them learn the basics of Chinese and build confidence in their communication skills.
2. Intergenerational programs: Organize intergenerational programs that bring together older adults and younger generations, such as children or teenagers. This can help break down age-related barriers and foster understanding and mutual respect between different age groups.
3. Social events: Host social events specifically designed for older adults, such as luncheons, picnics, or game nights. These events provide opportunities for socialization and can help build connections and friendships among participants.
4. Technology training: Provide training sessions on using technology, such as tablets or smartphones, to help older adults stay connected with their loved ones and the world around them. This can also help them access online resources and information related to Chinese language learning.
5. Cultural events: Organize cultural events that showcase Chinese culture and traditions, such as traditional music, dance, or art exhibitions. These events can provide opportunities for older adults to learn about and appreciate Chinese culture, while also fostering a sense of community among participants.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage older adults to volunteer their time and skills in the community, such as teaching Chinese language classes or participating in intergenerational programs. This can help them feel valuable and connected to society, while also providing an opportunity for younger generations to learn from them.
7. Health and wellness programs: Offer health and wellness programs specifically designed for older adults, focusing on topics such as exercise, nutrition, or mental health. These programs can help improve overall health and well-being, while also providing opportunities for socialization and connection with others.
8. Mentorship programs: Pair older adults with younger individuals who are interested in learning Chinese language and culture. This can provide an opportunity for both generations to learn from each other
