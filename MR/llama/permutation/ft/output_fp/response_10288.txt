Non-conservative mixed African Americans face a unique set of challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis: Due to their mixed racial identity, non-conservative mixed African Americans may face challenges in receiving accurate diagnoses or treatments from healthcare providers. Providers may make assumptions about their race or ethnicity based on their appearance, leading to misdiagnosis or a lack of diagnosis for conditions that are specific to their racial or ethnic group.
