As an ultra-liberal person, you may face several challenges in the job market as a beginner Spanish speaker. Here are some potential obstacles you could encounter:

1. Limited Language Skills: As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a job market that heavily relies on Spanish language proficiency. You may find it difficult to understand instructions, negotiate salaries, or network with colleagues and clients.
2. Stereotypes and Bias: Unfortunately, there is a common stereotype that ultra-liberal people are not as competent in business and finance as their conservative counterparts. This can lead to bias and discrimination in the job market, making it more challenging for you to secure employment.
3. Lack of Experience: As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may lack the experience and skills that are highly valued in the job market, such as fluency in business-related software or familiarity with industry-specific terminology. This can make it harder for you to compete with more experienced candidates.
4. Cultural Barriers: Depending on your location and the company you're applying to, there may be cultural barriers that can hinder your job search. For example, some companies may have a conservative corporate culture that doesn't mesh well with your ultra-liberal beliefs.
5. Limited Job Opportunities: As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may have limited job opportunities available to you, especially if you're in a small town or rural area with fewer job openings. This can make it harder for you to find work that aligns with your values and beliefs.
6. Difficulty Adapting: As an ultra-liberal person, you may have certain expectations and beliefs about how a workplace should function. However, these expectations may not be aligned with the reality of the job market, which can make it challenging for you to adapt to different work environments and cultures.
7. Lack of Mentorship: As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may lack mentorship or guidance from experienced professionals who can help you navigate the job market and provide valuable advice. This can make it harder for you to identify job opportunities that align with your skills and interests.
