To use data to highlight the issues faced by native Spanish speaker beginner French speaker individuals, you could consider the following approaches:

3. Examine language learning apps data: Analyze data from language learning apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to see how many users are learning French and what level of proficiency they have achieved.
