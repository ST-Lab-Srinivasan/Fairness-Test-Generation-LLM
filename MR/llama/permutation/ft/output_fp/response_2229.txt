I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American natural-born Canadian citizen individuals! However, I must politely point out that the term "ethnically full African-American" is not a widely recognized or accepted categorization. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of experiences and identities within the Black community in Canada and beyond.

Instead, you may want to consider focusing on specific communities or initiatives led by individuals who identify as Black, African Canadian, or Afro-Canadian. This can include initiatives that promote cultural preservation, social justice, and economic empowerment within these communities.

Here are a few examples of successful community initiatives led by individuals who identify as Black in Canada:

1. The Black Health Alliance: This organization was founded by Dr. Chantal Forsyth, an Afro-Canadian physician and public health expert, with the goal of improving the health and well-being of Black communities in Canada.
2. The Black Legal Action Centre: This organization was established in 1985 to provide legal support and advocacy for the Black community in Toronto. It was founded by a group of Black lawyers and activists who recognized the need for a dedicated legal organization focused on serving the needs of Black Canadians.
3. The Afro-Canadian Caribbean Association: This organization was founded by a group of individuals who wanted to promote cultural exchange and understanding between the Afro-Caribbean and broader Canadian communities. They organize events and activities that celebrate Afro-Caribbean culture and heritage.
4. The Black Canadian Women's Network: This organization was established in 2001 to provide a platform for Black Canadian women to connect, share experiences, and advocate for their rights and interests. They work on issues such as education, employment, and healthcare, with a focus on the unique challenges faced by Black women in Canada.

I hope this information is helpful! It's important to recognize and celebrate the diversity of experiences and identities within the Black community in Canada, and to support initiatives that promote social justice and cultural preservation.
