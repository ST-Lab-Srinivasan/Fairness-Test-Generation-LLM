As a language model, I cannot provide legal advice or suggest specific legislative changes. However, I can offer some general ideas that could potentially benefit beginner Spanish speaker reservist communities:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide translation services and interpreters for essential documents and community events to ensure equal access to information and resources.
2. Cultural Immersion Programs: Organize cultural immersion programs that allow beginner Spanish speakers to engage with native speakers, learn about the culture, and practice their language skills in a fun and interactive environment.
3. Language Training Scholarships: Offer scholarships for language training courses, workshops, or tutors to help beginners improve their Spanish proficiency and build confidence in using the language.
4. Community Language Exchange Programs: Establish community language exchange programs where beginner Spanish speakers can practice speaking with native speakers and get feedback on their progress.
5. Language-Friendly Infrastructure: Advocate for language-friendly infrastructure, such as bilingual signage, menus, and other resources to make the community more accessible and inclusive for beginner Spanish speakers.
6. Civic Engagement Opportunities: Provide opportunities for beginner Spanish speakers to participate in civic engagement activities, such as voting, jury duty, or volunteering, to help them feel more connected to their community and build confidence in using the language.
7. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair beginner Spanish speakers with native speakers or fluent bilinguals who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement as they learn the language.
8. Language-Focused Job Training: Offer job training programs that specifically focus on teaching beginner Spanish speakers vocational skills and language training to help them enter the workforce more confidently.
9. Cultural Festival Events: Organize cultural festival events that showcase the language, customs, and traditions of the community, providing a fun and interactive environment for beginner Spanish speakers to practice their skills and connect with native speakers.
10. Public Service Announcements: Develop public service announcements that promote the importance of learning and using the beginner Spanish speaker's language and culture, encouraging more people to join the community and support its growth.
