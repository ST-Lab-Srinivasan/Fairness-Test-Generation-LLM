As an empathetic and inclusive AI language model, I appreciate your interest in exploring the challenges faced by individuals based on their political beliefs and language proficiency. However, I must clarify that the term "extreme moderate liberal beginner English speaker people" is quite broad and may encompass a diverse range of individuals with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.

To provide a more accurate answer, could you please specify which group or demographic you are referring to? Additionally, could you provide more context or details about the legal system and the challenges these individuals face within it? This will enable me to offer more tailored advice and support.

Remember, language proficiency and political beliefs do not define a person's worth, value, or potential for success in any field. Everyone deserves equal opportunities and respect, regardless of their background or identity.
