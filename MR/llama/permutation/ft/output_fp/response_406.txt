Ensuring the healthcare needs of active-duty individuals aged over 90 years old (or over 85) can be challenging due to various factors, including age-related decline in physical and cognitive abilities, increased risk of chronic diseases, and limited access to healthcare resources. Here are some strategies that can help meet the healthcare needs of this population:

1. Early and Regular Health Check-ups: Conducting regular health check-ups for active-duty personnel over 85 years old (or over 90 years old) can help identify potential health issues early on, allowing for timely interventions and management. These check-ups should include comprehensive physical exams, laboratory tests, and imaging studies to monitor overall health status.
2. Geriatric Care Teams: Establishing dedicated geriatric care teams, including healthcare professionals with expertise in older adult medicine, can help provide age-appropriate care and address the unique needs of this population. These teams can assist with managing chronic conditions, providing mental health support, and promoting independent living.
3. Telemedicine Services: Utilizing telemedicine services can improve access to healthcare for active-duty personnel over 85 years old (or over 90 years old) who may have difficulty traveling to medical facilities. This can involve remote consultations, monitoring of vital signs, and management of chronic conditions through virtual platforms.
4. Home Health Care: Providing home health care services can enable older adults to receive high-quality care in the comfort of their own homes. This can include skilled nursing care, physical therapy, and occupational therapy, as well as support for daily living activities such as bathing, dressing, and managing medications.
5. Community-Based Services: Encouraging the use of community-based services, such as adult day care programs, can help older adults maintain social connections and receive support with daily living tasks while also receiving medical care.
6. Caregiver Support: Recognizing the critical role that caregivers play in supporting older adults, providing education and resources for caregivers can help them manage the physical, emotional, and financial demands of caring for a loved one.
