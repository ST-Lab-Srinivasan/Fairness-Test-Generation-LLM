Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native French speaker ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Understand the needs and experiences of the community: Conduct research or engage in dialogue with members of the Asian community to better understand their cultural background, experiences, and perspectives. This will help you design programs that are responsive to their needs and interests.
2. Be mindful of stereotypes and cultural appropriation: Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or using cultural elements in a way that is disrespectful or culturally insensitive. Instead, focus on promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
3. Involve the community in program development: Incorporate members of the Asian community in the development and implementation of cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are relevant and meaningful to them.
4. Offer a variety of cultural experiences: Provide opportunities for individuals to engage with different aspects of Asian cultures, such as language, music, dance, art, literature, and history.
5. Create intergenerational programs: Involve older and younger members of the Asian community in cultural programs to promote intergenerational connections and knowledge sharing.

9. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adjust your approach based on feedback from the community and changes in their needs and interests.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of Asian cultures and avoid perpetuating a single, homogenized image of what it means to be Asian. Instead, celebrate the richness and complexity of the Asian diaspora.
