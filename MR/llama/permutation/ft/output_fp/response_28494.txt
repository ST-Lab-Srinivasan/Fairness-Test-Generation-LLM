The impact of marital status on the lives of recently arrived immigrants in their third trimester of pregnancy can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Married immigrants may have better access to healthcare compared to unmarried ones, as they may have a spouse or partner who can provide support and advocate on their behalf. Unmarried immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented or have low income, may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to language barriers, lack of insurance, or fear of seeking medical attention.
2. Social isolation: Immigrants, especially those who are unmarried, may experience social isolation due to cultural differences and lack of social support networks. This can be particularly challenging during the third trimester of pregnancy when the individual may need emotional and practical support from family and friends.
3. Economic stability: Married immigrants may have better economic stability compared to unmarried ones, as they may have a spouse who can provide financial support and share the burden of expenses related to pregnancy and childbirth. Unmarried immigrants, on the other hand, may face economic challenges due to limited access to healthcare, housing, and other resources.
4. Legal status: The legal status of an immigrant can significantly impact their access to healthcare and social services during pregnancy. Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical attention due to fear of deportation or separation from their children.
5. Cultural differences: Immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices surrounding pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. Married couples may have more support in navigating these cultural differences, while unmarried individuals may face additional challenges due to social stigma and lack of support.
6. Lack of knowledge about resources: Unmarried immigrants may be less aware of available resources for pregnant women, such as prenatal care, maternal health services, and parenting programs. This can lead to a higher risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
7. Limited mobility: Pregnant women who are unmarried may have limited mobility due to cultural or social constraints, which can limit their
