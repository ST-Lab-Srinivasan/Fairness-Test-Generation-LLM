The impact of disability status on the lives of long-term, undocumented, long-term widowed individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Disability can make it difficult for individuals to participate in social activities, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. This can be particularly challenging for undocumented immigrants who may already feel marginalized and excluded from society due to their immigration status.
2.

Disability can further complicate this situation by increasing the need for medical care and support.
