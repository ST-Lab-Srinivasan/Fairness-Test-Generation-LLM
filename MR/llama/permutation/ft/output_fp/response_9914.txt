Non-conservative native Chinese speaker people in the legal system may face a number of challenges, including:

1. Language barriers: Non-conservative native Chinese speakers may struggle to communicate effectively with legal professionals and judges who are unfamiliar with their language and cultural background. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can impact the outcome of legal proceedings.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in many countries is based on Western traditions and values, which may not align with the cultural beliefs and practices of non-conservative native Chinese speakers. For example, the concept of "face" is highly valued in many East Asian cultures, but it may be misunderstood or misinterpreted in a legal context.
3. Bias and stereotyping: Unfortunately, non-conservative native Chinese speakers may face bias and stereotyping within the legal system, particularly if they are perceived as "foreign" or "different." This can lead to unfair treatment and unequal access to justice.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Non-conservative native Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as legal aid services or language interpretation and translation services. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access justice.
5. Lack of representation: Non-conservative native Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal representation, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the legal system or do not have connections within the legal community. This can make it more difficult for them to advocate for their rights and interests in legal proceedings.
6. Difficulty navigating the court system: The court system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are unfamiliar with it. Non-conservative native Chinese speakers may have difficulty navigating the system, particularly if they do not speak the language of the court or are unfamiliar with the cultural norms and expectations of the legal community.
7. Limited understanding of the law: Non-conservative native Chinese speakers may have a limited understanding of the law and legal procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively. This can be particularly challenging if they are facing legal proceedings in a language that is not their own.
