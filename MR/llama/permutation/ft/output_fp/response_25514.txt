Genetic conditions can have significant impacts on the lives of older adults who are financially disadvantaged, including:

1. Increased healthcare costs: Older adults with genetic conditions may incur higher healthcare costs due to more frequent medical appointments, hospitalizations, and prescription medications. Financial strain can result from these increased costs, especially for those who are already struggling to make ends meet.
2. Reduced quality of life: Genetic conditions can significantly impact an individual's quality of life, particularly if they experience chronic pain or disability. Older adults who are financially disadvantaged may find it challenging to afford the necessities of life, such as housing, food, and transportation, when they are struggling with a genetic condition.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Financially disadvantaged older adults may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to limited financial resources or lack of health insurance coverage. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment for genetic conditions, which can worsen their overall health and well-being.
4. Social isolation: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to the stigma associated with these conditions, particularly if they are financially disadvantaged. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety, which can further exacerbate their financial struggles.
5. Reduced independence: Genetic conditions can impact an individual's ability to perform daily activities, leading to reduced independence and dependence on others for support. Financially disadvantaged older adults may find it challenging to afford home modifications or assistive devices to help them maintain their independence.
6. Limited access to support services: Older adults with genetic conditions may have limited access to support services, such as counseling or case management, due to financial constraints. This can result in a lack of emotional and practical support during a challenging time.
7. Impact on family dynamics: Genetic conditions can impact not only the older adult but also their family members. Financially disadvantaged older adults may experience increased stress and burden on their families, particularly if they are the primary caregivers for a loved one with a genetic condition
