As a native English speaker with little to no knowledge of Arabic, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the healthcare system in an Arabic-speaking country. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge you may face is the language barrier. Arabic is the official language in many Middle Eastern and North African countries, and not everyone may speak English fluently.
