It is important to recognize that the impacts of immigration status can vary greatly depending on the individual's circumstances and the broader social and economic context. However, here are some potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-liberal people who are above the poverty line:

1. Increased access to education and job opportunities: Having a stable immigration status can provide individuals with greater access to educational resources and job opportunities, which can help them climb the social ladder and improve their socioeconomic status.
