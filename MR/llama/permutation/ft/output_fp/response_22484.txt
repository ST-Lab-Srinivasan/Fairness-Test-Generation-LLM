Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development and integration of Native American recent immigrants to the US, particularly during their late teenage years (ages 18-19). Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and a sense of belonging, which are essential for navigating the challenges of moving to a new country. Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Cultural navigation: Moving to a new country can be overwhelming, especially when facing cultural differences. A mentor who is familiar with both the Native American culture and the US culture can provide guidance on how to navigate these differences and avoid cultural shock.
2. Language acquisition: Many Native American recent immigrants may struggle with language barriers, particularly if they are not fluent in English. A mentor who speaks their native language and is familiar with their cultural background can help them improve their language skills and better understand the nuances of English communication.
3. Social integration: Building connections with peers and establishing a social network can be challenging for any immigrant, especially during the teenage years. A mentor can provide support in finding like-minded individuals and building friendships that are essential for mental health and well-being.
4. Academic support: Late teenage years (ages 18-19) are crucial for academic development, particularly as students prepare for college or the workforce. A mentor can provide academic guidance, help with college applications, and offer insights into career possibilities based on their own experiences.
5. Identity formation: Adolescence is a time of identity exploration and formation. A mentor who understands the unique challenges faced by Native American recent immigrants can provide support in navigating these complexities and helping them develop a strong sense of identity.
6. Coping with discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against Native Americans is still prevalent in many parts of the US. A mentor who has experienced similar challenges can offer valuable insights on how to cope with discrimination and build resilience.
7. Career exploration: Many Native American recent immigrants may not be aware of career options that align with their interests and skills. A mentor can provide guidance on career paths that are a good fit for them, based on their own
