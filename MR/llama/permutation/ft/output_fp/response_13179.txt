Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speaker immigrant recent immigrants in the US requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and interests of the target audience: Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather information about the participants' background, interests, and cultural preferences. This will help you tailor the programs to their needs and create a more inclusive environment.
2. Offer language classes: Provide beginner-level French language classes specifically designed for immigrants who may not have had access to French language instruction in their home countries or previous educational settings.
3. Cultural orientation: Offer cultural orientation programs that provide an overview of French culture, customs, and traditions. This can help participants better understand the social norms and expectations of French society, which can help them navigate everyday situations more effectively.
4. Intergenerational programming: Include older immigrants in the program by offering intergenerational activities that bring together individuals of different ages and backgrounds. This can help build relationships and a sense of community among participants.
5. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve immigrant communities, such as community centers, libraries, or social service agencies. These partnerships can help reach a wider audience and create more opportunities for cultural exchange.
6. Focus on accessibility: Ensure that the programs are accessible to participants with different levels of French proficiency and abilities. Offer flexible scheduling options, including evenings and weekends, to accommodate busy schedules.
7. Incorporate digital resources: Provide online resources, such as language learning apps or cultural websites, to supplement the in-person programs. This can help participants continue their learning outside of classroom hours.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diverse backgrounds and cultures of the participants by incorporating elements of different cultures into the programs. For example, you could include music, dance, or food from different cultures in your events.
9. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Pair beginners with more advanced learners or native speakers to facilitate language exchange and cultural sharing. This can help build relationships and create a sense of community among participants.
