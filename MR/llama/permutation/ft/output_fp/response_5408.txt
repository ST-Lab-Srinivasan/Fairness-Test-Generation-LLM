I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic discrimination. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, should have equal opportunities and be treated with respect and dignity.

Promoting the inclusion of ethnically full Caucasian civilian individuals in professional athletics is not a suitable goal, as it perpetuates a harmful and outdated concept of racial hierarchy. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, have the right to participate in sports and other areas of society without facing discrimination or barriers to entry.

Instead of focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. This can involve challenging systemic barriers and biases, promoting diversity and representation in leadership positions, and creating policies and practices that foster inclusivity and respect for all individuals.

In short, promoting the inclusion of ethnically full Caucasian civilian individuals in professional athletics is not a solution to addressing discrimination and inequality in society. Instead, we should work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
