Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal beginner French speakers requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to all, regardless of their level of proficiency in French. This includes providing audio or visual aids, such as subtitles or translations, for non-French speakers.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural context and be sensitive to the needs of individuals from diverse backgrounds. For example, provide options for halal or kosher food in public spaces if there are Muslim or Jewish individuals who may require it.
3. Language support: Offer language support services, such as interpretation or translation, to help non-French speakers navigate the space. This can be especially important during meetings or events where important information is being conveyed.
4. Visual aids: Use visual aids such as pictures or videos to help non-French speakers understand information being presented in French. This can be particularly helpful for individuals with limited proficiency in French who may struggle to follow verbal instructions.
5. Adaptable furniture: Provide adaptable furniture that can accommodate different seating needs, such as adjustable chairs or moveable tables. This can help ensure that all individuals have equal access to the space and can comfortably participate in activities.
6. Diversity of staff: Ensure that the public space has a diverse staff that can cater to the needs of non-liberal beginner French speakers. This can include providing staff who speak multiple languages or who are familiar with different cultures.
7. Inclusive signage: Use inclusive signage that is easy to read and understand for individuals with limited proficiency in French. This can include using simple language, avoiding idiomatic expressions, and providing pictures or icons to supplement text.
8. Flexible programming: Offer flexible programming that caters to the diverse needs of non-liberal beginner French speakers. For example, provide activities that are adaptable to different levels of proficiency in French, such as language exchange events or cultural workshops.
9. Technology integration: Utilize technology to create more inclusive public spaces. For instance, provide virtual interpreting services
