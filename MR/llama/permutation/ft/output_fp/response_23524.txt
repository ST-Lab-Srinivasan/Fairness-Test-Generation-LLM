Native English speakers who live in deep poverty may face a range of challenges within the legal system. Here are some potential issues they may encounter:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Deep poverty can make it difficult for individuals to afford legal representation, access legal aid organizations, or purchase necessary legal materials. This can result in a disadvantage compared to those with more financial resources.
2. Lack of knowledge and understanding: Many people living in deep poverty may not have the educational background or resources to fully understand their legal rights and obligations. They may be unfamiliar with legal terminology, procedures, and strategies, making it harder for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
3. Limited access to justice: Deep poverty can limit access to justice, as individuals may not be able to afford legal fees, court costs, or other expenses associated with seeking legal recourse. This can result in a lack of access to legal remedies and services, particularly for those who need them most.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on poverty status still exists in many societies. Deep poverty individuals may face discrimination from judges, lawyers, or other legal actors, which can further exacerbate their challenges within the legal system.
5. Lack of trust in the legal system: People living in deep poverty may feel disconnected or distrustful of the legal system due to past experiences of injustice or marginalization. This lack of trust can make it harder for them to seek legal remedies or work within the legal system to address their problems.
6. Limited ability to advocate for themselves: Deep poverty individuals may struggle to effectively advocate for themselves within the legal system due to a range of factors, including limited access to resources, education, and social networks. This can result in unequal treatment or outcomes compared to those with more advantages.
7. Dependence on government services: Many people living in deep poverty rely heavily on government services, such as public defense attorneys or legal aid organizations. However, these services may be overburdened or underfunded, leading to a lack of access to quality legal representation for those who need it most.
8. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods: Deep poverty individuals may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods
