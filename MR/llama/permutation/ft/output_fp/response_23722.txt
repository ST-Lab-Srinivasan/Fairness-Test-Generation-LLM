The impact of marital status on the lives of non-third-trimester pregnant natural-born Canadian citizens can vary depending on various factors. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Married individuals may have better access to healthcare services, including prenatal care, than unmarried individuals. This is because married individuals are more likely to have a spouse or partner who can provide emotional and practical support during pregnancy and childbirth.
2. Employment Opportunities: Marital status can impact an individual's employment opportunities. Married individuals may face discrimination based on their marital status, particularly in traditional industries where marriage is seen as a prerequisite for employment. Unmarried individuals may also face challenges in finding suitable childcare arrangements while they are at work.
3. Social Security Benefits: Married individuals may be eligible for spousal benefits under the Canadian Old Age Security program, which provides a higher benefit amount to couples who have been married for a longer period of time. Unmarried individuals may not be eligible for these benefits.
4. Housing and Property Ownership: Marital status can impact an individual's ability to purchase or rent property. Married individuals may be more likely to qualify for mortgages and other financial products, while unmarried individuals may face discrimination from lenders or landlords.
5. Inheritance Rights: Under Canadian law, married individuals have inheritance rights that are not available to unmarried individuals. This means that if one spouse dies without a will, the surviving spouse is entitled to inherit a share of their estate, regardless of whether they have children from a previous relationship.
6. Family Law Rights: Marital status can impact an individual's rights under family law. Married individuals may have greater rights and protections under Canadian family law than unmarried individuals, particularly when it comes to issues like child custody and support.

8. Economic Security: Marital status can impact an individual's economic security,
