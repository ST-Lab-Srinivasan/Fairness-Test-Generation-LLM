To highlight the issues faced by non-upper-class recent immigrants to Canada using data, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Demographic analysis: Examine the demographic characteristics of recent immigrants to Canada, such as age, gender, education level, occupation, and income. Analyze how these factors affect their access to resources, opportunities, and services in Canada. For example, you could look at the median income of recent immigrants compared to the national average, or the percentage of recent immigrants who have a university degree compared to the overall population.
2. Economic mobility analysis: Examine how recent immigrants fare in terms of economic mobility in Canada. Look at factors such as income mobility (the ability to move up or down the income ladder), wealth mobility (the ability to accumulate or deplete wealth), and access to social safety nets (such as healthcare, education, and housing). You could also look at how these factors vary across different immigrant groups, such as those from different regions of the world or with different levels of education.
3. Access to services analysis: Examine how recent immigrants access various services in Canada, such as healthcare, education, and social services. Look at the barriers they face in accessing these services, such as language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of knowledge about available resources. You could also look at how these barriers vary across different immigrant groups.
4. Discrimination analysis: Examine the extent to which recent immigrants experience discrimination in Canada, both in terms of direct discrimination (such as unequal treatment) and indirect discrimination (such as biases and stereotypes). Look at how different factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation can affect an immigrant's experience of discrimination.
5. Political engagement analysis: Examine the political engagement of recent immigrants in Canada, including their levels of civic participation, political knowledge, and political attitudes. Look at how different factors such as language proficiency, education level, and socioeconomic status can affect an immigrant's political engagement.
6. Social integration analysis: Examine the social integration of recent immigrants in Canada,
