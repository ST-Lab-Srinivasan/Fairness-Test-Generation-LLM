Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers from ethnically full Hispanic backgrounds requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make your programs more welcoming and engaging:

1. Cultural competency training: Provide training on cultural competency and diversity for program staff and volunteers. This can help them understand the diverse experiences, traditions, and practices of different Hispanic groups and tailor their programming accordingly.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that your programs include diverse perspectives and representations of Hispanic cultures. This can be achieved by incorporating stories, music, dance, and art from different countries and communities.
3. Use inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all Hispanic groups. Avoid using stereotypes or assumptions based on participants' ethnicity or cultural background.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where participants feel welcome and included. Encourage participation and engagement from all members of the group, and provide opportunities for them to share their experiences and perspectives.
5. Provide culturally relevant materials: Use materials that are relevant to the participants' cultural backgrounds and experiences. For example, use Spanish-language books or videos that reflect the diverse experiences of Hispanic communities.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential power dynamics at play in your programs, particularly when working with participants from marginalized communities. Be mindful of your positionality and privilege, and work to create an equitable and inclusive environment for all participants.
7. Involve community members: Involve members of the Hispanic community in the development and implementation of your programs. This can help ensure that your programs are culturally relevant and responsive to the needs of the community.
8. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adapt your programs based on feedback from participants and the broader community. This can help ensure that your programs remain inclusive and relevant over time.
9. Provide accessibility accommodations: Ensure that your programs are accessible to participants with disabilities or other accessibility needs. This can involve providing sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or other accommodations as needed.
