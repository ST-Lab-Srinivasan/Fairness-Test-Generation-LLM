Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American natural-born US citizens who identify as progressive. Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and encouragement to help individuals navigate their personal and professional journey, especially in a society where they may face unique challenges and barriers based on their identity. Here are some ways mentorship can impact the development of Native American progressives:

1. Cultural connection and understanding: Mentors can help mentees connect with their cultural heritage and understand its significance in shaping their identities and values. This can foster a deeper appreciation for traditional practices, beliefs, and ways of being that are critical to Native American culture.

4. Leadership development: Progressive mentors can help mentees develop leadership skills and confidence, which is critical for creating positive change in their communities and beyond. By providing guidance and support, mentors can empower mentees to take on leadership roles and make a meaningful impact.
5. Advocacy and activism: Many Native American progressives are passionate about advocating for social justice and fighting against systemic inequality. Mentors can help mentees develop their advocacy skills, connect them with resources and networks, and encourage them to engage in activism that promotes positive change.
6. Personal growth: Mentorship can facilitate personal growth by providing a safe space for mentees to explore their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This can lead to greater self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and resilience, which are essential for navigating the challenges of life as a Native American progressive.
7. Networking: Mentors can introduce mentees to influential individuals and organizations within their communities and beyond. This can lead to new opportunities
