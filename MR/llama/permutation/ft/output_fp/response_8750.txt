The impact of marital status on the lives of career-aged immigrants to Canada with a genetic condition can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: As a recent immigrant, an individual may face challenges accessing healthcare services in Canada due to language barriers or difficulties navigating the healthcare system. This can be particularly problematic for individuals with a genetic condition who require ongoing medical attention. Marital status can affect access to healthcare as married individuals may have better access to health insurance and other benefits than unmarried individuals.
2. Social isolation: Immigrants, especially those who are recent arrivals, may experience social isolation due to cultural differences and language barriers. This can be particularly challenging for individuals with a genetic condition who may need emotional support from family and friends. Marital status can affect social connections as married individuals may have a built-in support network, while unmarried individuals may have fewer opportunities for social interaction.

7. Legal status: The impact of marital status on legal status can be significant for recent immigrants with a genetic condition. Married individuals may have better access to legal resources and support, while
