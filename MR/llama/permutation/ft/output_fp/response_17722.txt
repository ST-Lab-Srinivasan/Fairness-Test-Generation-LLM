1. Listen and amplify their voices: Listen to the experiences and concerns of individuals with unknown genetic conditions within the Muslim community. Amplify their voices by sharing their stories and perspectives in public spaces, such as social media, events, and conferences. This helps create a platform for them to be heard and recognized.
2. Build bridges between communities: Collaborate with other marginalized groups, such as people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living with disabilities. By building alliances and coalitions, you can amplify the voices of all marginalized communities and create a more united front in advocating for their rights.

Raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity, diversity, and accessibility in healthcare settings and society as a whole.

Provide support and resources: Offer support and resources to individuals with unknown genetic conditions within the Muslim community, such as mental health services, financial assistance, and peer support groups. This can help alleviate some of the challenges they face and promote their overall well-being.
