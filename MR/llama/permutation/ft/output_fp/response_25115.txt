Language plays a significant role in the identity of over 90-year-old reservists, as it can shape their sense of self and community. Here are some ways language can impact the identity of this age group:

1. Cultural preservation: For many older reservists, their native language is an important part of their cultural heritage. It connects them to their ancestors and cultural traditions, which can provide a sense of belonging and identity.
2. Community ties: Language can also play a crucial role in maintaining social connections within indigenous communities. Older reservists may use language as a means of communication and community building, especially among peers who share the same linguistic background.
3. Resilience and adaptation: The ability to speak multiple languages can be seen as a symbol of resilience and adaptability, particularly for older reservists who have faced historical trauma and ongoing discrimination. Being able to navigate different linguistic and cultural contexts can help them cope with the challenges of aging and maintain their identity.
4. Intergenerational transmission: Language can be passed down through generations, allowing older reservists to connect with their ancestors and younger community members. This intergenerational transmission can strengthen social bonds and cultural continuity within indigenous communities.
5. Self-expression and identity formation: Language can serve as a means of self-expression and identity formation for older reservists. Through language, they can express their experiences, beliefs, and values, which can help shape their sense of self and community.
6. Power dynamics: Language can also play a role in power dynamics within indigenous communities. Older reservists may use language to assert their authority or challenge dominant narratives, particularly if they have been marginalized or silenced historically.
7. Cultural revitalization: Some older reservists may be involved in language revitalization efforts, such as teaching their native language in schools or communities. This can help preserve the language and cultural heritage for future generations.
8. Intersectionality: Language can intersect with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, and sexuality. Older reservists may experience language-based discrimination or feel marginalized due to their linguistic background, which can impact their overall sense of self and
