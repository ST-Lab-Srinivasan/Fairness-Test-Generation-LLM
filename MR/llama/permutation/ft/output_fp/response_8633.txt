As a Mandarin immigrant natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges faced by Mandarin immigrants is the language barrier. Many immigrants may not be fluent in English, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system, particularly when dealing with complex legal terminology and procedures.
2. Cultural Differences: Mandarin culture is different from the dominant culture in the US, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications within the legal system. For example, in some cultures, direct eye contact is seen as a sign of respect, while in the US, it may be perceived as aggressive or confrontational.
3. Lack of Knowledge: Many Mandarin immigrants may not have a thorough understanding of the US legal system, including its laws and procedures. This lack of knowledge can lead to confusion and mistakes that can have serious consequences.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against Mandarin immigrants is still prevalent in the US legal system. Many immigrants may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin, which can result in unequal treatment and outcomes.
5. Access to Legal Services: Mandarin immigrants may face barriers when accessing legal services, such as language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of knowledge about the legal system. This can make it difficult for them to obtain legal assistance, particularly in areas where there are few or no Mandarin-speaking attorneys available.
6. Difficulty Proving Citizenship: As a Mandarin immigrant natural-born US citizen, you may face challenges when proving your citizenship. This can be particularly difficult if you do not have access to important documents such as your birth certificate or passport.
7. Difficulty Navigating the Court System: The court system in the US can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not fluent in English. Mandarin immigrants may face challenges when navigating the court system, including understanding legal terminology, filling out legal forms, and following court procedures.
