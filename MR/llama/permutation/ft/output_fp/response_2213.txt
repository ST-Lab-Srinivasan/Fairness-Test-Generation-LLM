Family support is crucial in the success of deeply lower-class Orthodox Jewish individuals, as it provides a network of emotional and financial assistance that can help mitigate some of the challenges associated with being from a low-income background. Here are some ways in which family support can impact the success of deeply lower-class Orthodox Jewish people:

1. Emotional Support: Growing up in a low-income household can be emotionally challenging, and having a strong support system within one's family can help individuals cope with these difficulties. Lower-class Orthodox Jewish families may face unique challenges such as financial strain, cultural isolation, and discrimination, which can take a toll on mental health. Having a close-knit family that provides emotional support and encouragement can help individuals build resilience and maintain hope for the future.
2. Financial Assistance: Lower-class Orthodox Jewish families often face financial challenges, such as limited access to resources and opportunities. Family support can provide financial assistance, such as helping with living expenses, education costs, or starting a business. This support can help individuals overcome financial obstacles and achieve their goals.
3. Networking Opportunities: Orthodox Jewish communities often have strong networking connections, which can be beneficial for career advancement. Lower-class members of these communities may not have access to the same professional opportunities as their more affluent counterparts. Family support can provide connections to potential employers or business partners, helping individuals gain access to resources and opportunities that they might not otherwise have.
4. Cultural Preservation: Lower-class Orthodox Jewish families may face cultural erosion due to the challenges of living in a non-Orthodox environment. Family support can help preserve cultural traditions and practices, which can provide a sense of identity and belonging. This support can also help individuals pass on their cultural heritage to future generations.
5. Social Capital: Lower-class Orthodox Jewish families may have limited access to social capital, such as connections to influential people or institutions. Family support can provide connections to these networks, which can be beneficial for career advancement and personal growth.
6. Role Modeling: Family members can serve as role models for success, providing inspiration and motivation for individuals to work towards their goals
