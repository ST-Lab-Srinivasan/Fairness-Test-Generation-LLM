Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers who are not high-income professionals requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and inclusive:

1. Offer free or low-cost events: Many people who are not high-income professionals may not be able to afford expensive event tickets. By offering free or low-cost events, you can make your events more accessible to a wider range of people.
2. Provide childcare and transportation options: Many beginner Spanish speakers may have children or lack transportation, making it difficult for them to attend events. Consider providing childcare and transportation options to help make your events more convenient and inclusive.
3. Use simple language and visual aids: Beginner Spanish speakers may not be fluent in the language, so use simple language and provide visual aids to help them understand and participate in the event.
4. Offer cultural activities and experiences: Incorporating cultural activities and experiences into your events can help beginner Spanish speakers feel more comfortable and engaged. For example, you could offer traditional food, music, or dance workshops.
5. Create a welcoming atmosphere: Make sure your events have a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. Encourage participants to interact with each other and provide opportunities for them to practice their Spanish skills.
6. Offer follow-up support: After the event, consider offering follow-up support to help beginner Spanish speakers continue learning and practicing the language. This could include providing additional resources, such as language learning apps or podcasts, or organizing small group meetings for continued practice and support.
7. Partner with local organizations: Partnering with local organizations that serve beginner Spanish speakers can help you reach a wider audience and provide more inclusive events. For example, you could partner with community centers, libraries, or other organizations that offer language classes or cultural events.
8. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many beginner Spanish speakers may have busy schedules or limited mobility, making it difficult for them to attend events during traditional hours. Consider offering flexible scheduling options, such as weekend events or evening classes.
9. Provide interpreters and translators: For events that include speeches or presentations, consider providing interpreters or translators
