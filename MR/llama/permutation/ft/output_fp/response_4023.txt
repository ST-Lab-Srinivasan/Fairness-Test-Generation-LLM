Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US who are also highly advanced self-taught experts requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique experiences and challenges. Here are some potential strategies for supporting this population:

1. Cultural sensitivity and awareness: It's essential to be aware of the cultural differences and historical traumas that Native American communities have experienced, particularly in regards to immigration and loss. Be sensitive to these issues and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on their race or ethnicity.

Work to address systemic barriers and inequities that may limit their access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities.
8. Collaboration with other organizations: Collaborate with other organizations and agencies that serve Native
