Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American natural-born US citizens, particularly those who identify as individualists. Here are some ways mentorship can impact their development:

1. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Mentorship can help preserve and revitalize Native American cultures by passing down traditional knowledge, practices, and beliefs from one generation to the next. This is particularly important for individualists who may value cultural autonomy and self-determination.
2. Identity formation: Mentorship can help individuals navigate their identity as a Native American within the larger US society. Mentors can provide guidance on how to embrace and express one's cultural heritage, while also navigating the challenges of living in a predominantly non-Native society.
3. Skill development: Mentorship can help individuals develop practical skills such as language proficiency, traditional craftsmanship, and community leadership. These skills are essential for individualists who value autonomy and self-sufficiency.
4. Networking and collaboration: Mentorship can facilitate networking and collaboration within Native American communities. This can help individualists connect with like-minded people and build alliances that support their goals and values.
5. Resilience and coping strategies: Mentorship can provide individuals with resilience and coping strategies to deal with the historical trauma, systemic inequality, and cultural erasure that Native Americans have faced. By learning from the experiences of mentors who have navigated similar challenges, individualists can develop their own coping mechanisms and find ways to heal and grow.
6. Empowerment and agency: Mentorship can empower individuals by providing them with a sense of agency and control over their lives. By learning from mentors who have achieved success in their fields, individualists can gain the confidence and skills necessary to pursue their own goals and aspirations.
7. Role modeling: Mentorship can provide individuals with positive role models who embody the values of individualism, such as self-reliance, independence, and creativity. By observing how mentors live out these values in their daily lives, individualists can learn from their examples and incorporate these values into their own lives.
8. Personal growth:
