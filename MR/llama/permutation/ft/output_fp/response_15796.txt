Supporting the economic empowerment of over 90 years old post-transition transgender individuals can be challenging, but there are several ways to help them achieve financial stability and security. Here are some suggestions:

1. Financial Assistance Programs: Organizations can establish financial assistance programs specifically for post-transition transgender individuals aged 90 and above. These programs can provide funding for medical expenses, living expenses, and other necessary resources to help them maintain their quality of life.
2. Legacy Planning: Many post-transition transgender individuals may not have had the opportunity to plan for their financial future due to discrimination, marginalization, or lack of access to resources. Organizations can offer legacy planning services, such as wills, trusts, and estate planning, to help them ensure that their assets are protected and distributed according to their wishes after they pass away.
3. Entrepreneurship Support: Post-transition transgender individuals may face additional barriers when starting a business due to discrimination, lack of access to resources, or limited social support. Organizations can provide mentorship, training, and networking opportunities to help them overcome these challenges and build successful entrepreneurial ventures.
4. Housing Support: Many post-transition transgender individuals may face housing insecurity due to discrimination, lack of access to affordable housing, or limited social support. Organizations can provide financial assistance for down payments, mortgage assistance, and rental subsidies to help them secure stable and affordable housing.
5. Healthcare Support: Post-transition transgender individuals may face additional healthcare challenges due to discrimination, lack of access to quality healthcare, or limited social support. Organizations can provide financial assistance for medical expenses, including gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapy, as well as mental health support services to help them manage stress and anxiety related to their transition.
6. Education and Training: Many post-transition transgender individuals may face barriers to education and training due to discrimination, lack of access to resources, or limited social support. Organizations can provide scholarships, mentorship programs, and vocational training to help them acquire new skills and knowledge to improve their employability and financial stability.
