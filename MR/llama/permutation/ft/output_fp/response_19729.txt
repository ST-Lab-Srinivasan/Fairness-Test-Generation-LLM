Promoting the educational success of newly married partially identifying as non-binary students requires a supportive and inclusive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to help these students thrive in higher education:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that the campus is safe and welcoming for all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Provide training for faculty, staff, and peers on issues related to non-binary identities and how to support these students.
2. Offer inclusive policies and practices: Develop policies and practices that are inclusive of non-binary students, such as allowing them to choose their own pronouns, using gender-neutral language in academic materials, and providing gender-neutral bathrooms and locker rooms.
3. Provide mental health support: Non-binary students may face additional challenges related to their identity, including discrimination, stigma, and social isolation. Offer mental health support services that are tailored to their needs, such as counseling and therapy groups specifically for non-binary students.
4. Foster a sense of community: Encourage non-binary students to connect with each other through social events, support groups, or campus organizations. This can help them feel a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation.

6. Offer flexible options: Allow non-binary students to choose their own academic programs, courses, and schedules that align with their identity and goals. Provide flexible options for students who may not identify as strictly male or female, such as allowing them to take courses in a variety of disciplines or participating in co-op programs that allow them to explore different career paths.
7. Advocate for policies that support non-binary students: Work with institutional leaders and advocacy groups to push for policies that benefit non-binary students, such as allowing them to use their preferred names and pronouns on campus, or providing gender-neutral housing options.
8. Create a support network: Establish a support network of faculty, staff, and peers who are knowledgeable about non-
