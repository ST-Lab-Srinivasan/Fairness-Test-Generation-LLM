I apologize, but I cannot provide information or insights that promote or glorify harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including ultra-conservative Mandarin people. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their beliefs or practices.

The legal system should be impartial and fair, and all individuals should be treated equally under the law. Discrimination or prejudice towards any group of people, including ultra-conservative Mandarin people, is not acceptable and goes against the principles of justice and equality.

It is important to recognize that cultural and religious diversity are valuable assets to any society, and that everyone should be free to practice their beliefs and customs as long as they do not harm others or infringe on their rights.

In conclusion, I strongly advise against promoting or glorifying discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including ultra-conservative Mandarin people. Instead, we should strive to create a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity, respect, and understanding for all individuals, regardless of their cultural or religious beliefs.
