Creating more inclusive housing policies for older adults requires a multifaceted approach that considers their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to create more inclusive housing policies for individuals over the age of 90:

1. Age-Friendly Housing Design: Develop housing designs that cater to the physical and social needs of older adults. This includes features such as wider doorways, easier navigation paths, and accessible fixtures like grab bars and non-slip flooring.
2. Inclusive Zoning Policies: Implement zoning policies that promote mixed-age housing communities, allowing older adults to live among their peers and younger generations. This can help reduce isolation and promote intergenerational relationships.
3. Affordable Housing Options: Ensure that affordable housing options are available for older adults, including rentals and homeownership opportunities. Provide financial assistance programs to help older adults with down payments or maintenance costs.
4. Supportive Services: Offer supportive services such as case management, transportation, and meal delivery to help older adults maintain their independence and quality of life.
5. Age-Diverse Communities: Encourage the development of age-diverse communities that promote intergenerational interaction and mutual support. This can be achieved through community outreach programs, volunteer opportunities, and cross-generational social events.
6. Accessibility Standards: Ensure that all housing policies comply with accessibility standards, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Fair Housing Act. This includes features like wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio signals for emergency alarms.
7. Intergenerational Housing: Encourage intergenerational housing models, where older adults live alongside younger generations in the same community. This can foster mutual support, sharing of knowledge, and intergenerational relationships.
8. Community Engagement: Foster community engagement and social connections through organized events, volunteer opportunities, and cross-generational activities. This can help combat loneliness and isolation among older adults.
9. Housing Counseling: Provide housing counseling services to help older adults navigate the complex process
