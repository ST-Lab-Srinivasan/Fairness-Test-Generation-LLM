There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Chinese speakers:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: Create surveys or polls to gather data on the challenges and difficulties faced by beginner Chinese speakers. This can help identify common issues such as difficulty with tones, grammar, vocabulary, etc.
2. Analyze language learning data: Use data analytics tools to analyze data from language learning platforms, apps, or online courses. This can help identify patterns in language learning behavior, such as how long it takes for beginners to reach certain proficiency levels, what topics are most challenging, etc.
3. Use sentiment analysis: Analyze text data from language learning forums, social media, or other online platforms to understand the emotions and attitudes of beginner Chinese speakers towards language learning. This can help identify common frustrations, motivations, and areas where support is needed.
4. Create a user journey map: Map out the journey of a beginner Chinese speaker from the moment they decide to start learning until they reach proficiency. This can help identify pain points, opportunities for support, and ways to optimize the language learning experience.
5. Conduct case studies: Select a small group of beginner Chinese speakers and conduct in-depth interviews or observations to gather data on their language learning experiences. This can help identify specific issues and challenges faced by individual learners.
6. Use machine learning algorithms: Train machine learning algorithms on data from language learning platforms, apps, or online courses to identify patterns and trends in language learning behavior. This can help predict which areas of language learning may be most challenging for beginner Chinese speakers and provide personalized support.
7. Create a language learning dashboard: Develop a dashboard that displays data on the progress and performance of beginner Chinese speakers. This can help identify areas where learners need improvement, provide real-time feedback, and encourage learners to stay motivated and engaged.
8. Use natural language processing (NLP): Analyze text data from language learning resources, such as textbooks, articles, or online courses, to identify patterns and trends in language use. This can help identify common errors, areas where learners may struggle, and ways to improve language proficiency.
9. Conduct a sentiment analysis of language learning materials:
