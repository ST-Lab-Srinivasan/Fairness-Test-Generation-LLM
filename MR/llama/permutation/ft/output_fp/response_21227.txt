The term "just above poverty line" is subjective and can vary depending on the country or region. In general, it refers to individuals who have an income slightly higher than the poverty line but still struggle to make ends meet. Ethnically full Asian people in this category may face unique challenges in the healthcare system due to a combination of socioeconomic factors and discrimination. Here are some potential challenges they might encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Individuals from low-income backgrounds may have difficulty affording healthcare services, including preventive care, medical treatments, and prescription medications. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, exacerbating health problems and creating additional burdens on the healthcare system.
2. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of their region, communication with healthcare providers can be challenging. This can result in misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical needs or treatment options, leading to suboptimal care.
3. Cultural and racial discrimination: Ethnically full Asian people may face discrimination in the healthcare system based on their race or ethnicity. This can manifest in various ways, such as biases among healthcare providers, unequal access to resources, or a lack of cultural competence in addressing their specific needs.
4. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of the population, particularly in terms of race and ethnicity. This can result in a lack of understanding about the unique healthcare needs of marginalized communities, leading to inadequate care or misdiagnosis.
5. Stigma and shame: Individuals from low-income backgrounds may experience feelings of stigma or shame when seeking medical care. This can be due to cultural norms, social attitudes, or the perception that accessing healthcare is a sign of weakness or failure.
6. Limited awareness of available resources: Ethnically full Asian people may be less aware of available healthcare resources, such as community clinics, sliding-scale fees, or government programs. This lack of knowledge can result in missed opportunities for preventive care or delayed access to necessary treatments.
