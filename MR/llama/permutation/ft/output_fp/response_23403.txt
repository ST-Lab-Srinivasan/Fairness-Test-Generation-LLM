Lifelong single, fully embracing non-binary individuals face a variety of challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Lack of legal recognition: Unlike many countries that recognize gender identity through legal frameworks, India does not have a comprehensive law that protects and recognizes the rights of non-binary individuals. This lack of legal recognition can make it difficult for them to access basic rights such as healthcare, education, and employment.
2. Gendered identity documents: In India, most identity documents, such as passports, driving licenses, and voter ID cards, are issued based on gender. Non-binary individuals may face difficulties in obtaining these documents that align with their gender identity, leading to discrimination and marginalization.
3. Discrimination in employment: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination in the workplace, particularly if they do not have legal recognition of their gender identity. This can result in unequal treatment, harassment, or denial of promotion opportunities.
4. Healthcare disparities: Non-binary individuals may face challenges in accessing healthcare that aligns with their gender identity. For instance, they may be subjected to unnecessary or invasive medical procedures, such as gender confirmation surgeries, without proper consultation and support.
5. Lack of representation in policy-making: Non-binary individuals are often underrepresented in policymaking processes, which can result in a lack of understanding and empathy towards their needs and concerns. This can lead to policies that do not address the specific challenges faced by non-binary individuals.
6. Social stigma and harassment: Non-binary individuals may face social stigma and harassment due to their gender identity. This can result in emotional distress, social isolation, and difficulties in accessing support systems.
7. Limited access to resources: Non-binary individuals may face limited access to resources such as financial support, housing, and education due to discrimination and stigma.
8. Inadequate legal protection: Non-binary individuals may lack legal protection against discrimination and violence based on their gender identity. This can result in a lack of recourse for those who face discrimination or harassment.
9. Lack of understanding among law
