1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they can better understand the beliefs, values, and practices of their patients. This leads to higher patient satisfaction and trust, which is critical for building a positive doctor-patient relationship.
2. Better diagnostic accuracy: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers recognize and address cultural factors that may impact a patient's symptoms or behaviors.
