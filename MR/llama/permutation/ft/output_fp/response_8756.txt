Supporting nominal Christian communities, particularly those in the mid-50 age range, can be challenging as many of these individuals may have grown disconnected from their faith. However, here are some effective strategies to help support and engage them:

1. Understand their needs and concerns: Listen to their stories, and understand what matters most to them. This could include issues related to aging, health, family, and financial security. By showing empathy and understanding, you can build trust and rapport.
2. Offer intergenerational programs: Organize events or activities that bring together people of different ages, such as mentorship programs, community service projects, or social gatherings. This can help bridge the gap between generations and foster a sense of connection and belonging.
3. Provide spiritual nourishment: Offer worship services, Bible studies, or prayer groups specifically tailored to their needs and interests. Use age-appropriate language and formats to make these activities accessible and engaging.
4. Encourage community involvement: Support their desire to give back to the community by organizing volunteer opportunities, outreach programs, or other service projects. This can help them feel more connected to their faith and the world around them.
5. Develop lifelong learning opportunities: Provide classes, workshops, or seminars on topics relevant to their stage of life, such as retirement planning, healthy aging, or spiritual growth. This can help them feel empowered and engaged in their faith journey.
6. Create a sense of belonging: Foster a feeling of community by hosting regular gatherings, potlucks, or other social events. Encourage them to connect with one another and build relationships based on shared values and experiences.
7. Offer pastoral care: Provide regular visitation, phone calls, or other forms of spiritual support to help them navigate the challenges of aging. Listen to their concerns, offer guidance and comfort, and help them find resources for emotional and spiritual well-being.
8. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms to reach out to this age group, such as online worship services, video sermons, or social media groups. This can help them stay connected to their faith community even if they are unable to attend in-person events.
