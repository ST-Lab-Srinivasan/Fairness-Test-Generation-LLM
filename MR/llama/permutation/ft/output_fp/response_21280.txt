As a beginner Chinese speaker who has been divorced multiple times, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some potential obstacles and ways to overcome them:

1. Language barrier: If your Chinese language skills are limited, you may find it difficult to communicate effectively in a job interview or during work. Consider taking language classes or working with a tutor to improve your proficiency.
