As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that there is no specific data or research available on the challenges faced by advanced aged (over 90 years old) mixed Hispanic heritage people in the legal system. This is likely due to the lack of representation and visibility of this particular demographic in research and data collection efforts.

However, I can provide some general insights and potential challenges that older adults, including those from diverse ethnic backgrounds, may face in the legal system based on existing research and literature:

1. Ageism and stereotyping: Older adults, particularly those from marginalized communities, may encounter ageist attitudes and biases from legal professionals, judges, and other stakeholders. These biases can lead to inadequate representation, misunderstandings of their needs and preferences, and unfair treatment in legal proceedings.
2. Cognitive decline: As people age, they may experience cognitive decline, which can affect their ability to understand and navigate the complex legal system. This can be particularly challenging for mixed Hispanic heritage individuals who may face language barriers or cultural differences that can exacerbate these issues.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Older adults, including those from underrepresented communities, may have limited access to legal resources such as attorneys, legal aid organizations, and other support services. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
4. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system may not be equipped to address the unique needs and experiences of mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. For example, cultural differences in communication styles or expectations around family dynamics may lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
5. Discrimination and bias: Discrimination and bias can occur at various stages of the legal process, including during investigations, trial proceedings, and sentencing. Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural identity, which can result in unfair treatment and outcomes.
6. Limited access to language support: Depending on the location and jurisdiction, there may be limited access to language support services for older adults who are not fluent
