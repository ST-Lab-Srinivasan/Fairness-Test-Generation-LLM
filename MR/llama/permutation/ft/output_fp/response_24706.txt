I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about individuals based on their marital status, visa status, or any other personal characteristic. It is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.

It is important to recognize that diversity and inclusion are valuable assets in any community or organization, and that the perspectives and experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds can bring unique insights and contributions. However, it is not appropriate to make assumptions about an individual's worth or value based on their marital status or visa status.

I would encourage you to focus on promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their personal characteristics. This can involve educating oneself about the experiences and challenges faced by diverse groups, actively seeking out diverse perspectives, and advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.
