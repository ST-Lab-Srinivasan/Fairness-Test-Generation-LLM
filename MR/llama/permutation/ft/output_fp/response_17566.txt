As a language learner, I understand the challenges of starting out in a new language. Here are some ways data can be used to highlight the issues faced by beginner Chinese speakers:

1. Analysis of learning patterns: By analyzing the learning patterns of beginner Chinese learners, you can identify common mistakes, weaknesses, and areas where they struggle the most. For example, you could analyze how often learners practice tones or how long it takes them to master basic vocabulary and grammar structures.
2. Identifying language gaps: By analyzing the language gap between beginner Chinese learners and native speakers, you can identify the areas where learners need the most improvement. For example, you could analyze how many words learners know compared to the average number of words known by native speakers at their level.

For example, you could analyze how often a learner practices tones and create a plan to help them improve their tone recognition skills.
6. Assessing the effectiveness of language learning methods: By analyzing data on the effectiveness of different language learning methods, such as flashcards or immersion programs, you can identify which methods are most effective for beginner Chinese learners.
7. Identifying cultural differences and how they impact learning: By analyzing data on cultural differences between learners and native speakers, you can identify how these differences may impact learner success. For example, you could analyze how cultural norms around communication styles may affect a learner's ability to practice speaking Chinese.
8. Understanding the impact of language anxiety: By analyzing data on language anxiety among beginner Chinese learners, you
