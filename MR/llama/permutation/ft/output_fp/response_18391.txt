Protecting the legal rights of late pregnancy (third trimester) physically disabled individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Accessibility and Accommodation: Ensure that healthcare facilities, services, and programs are accessible and inclusive for individuals with disabilities.

This can include learning about best practices in obstetric care, as well as understanding the unique needs and experiences of individuals with disabilities.

7. Collaboration and Partnership: Foster collaboration and partnerships between healthcare providers, disability organizations, and advocacy groups. This can help ensure that the needs and experiences of individuals with disabilities are taken into
