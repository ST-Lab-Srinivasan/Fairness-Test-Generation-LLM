I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic discrimination. Mentorship should be based on an individual's merits and abilities, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. It is important to recognize that mentorship can play a significant role in the personal and professional development of any individual, regardless of their identity.

As a hardcore libertarian, you may believe in the importance of individual freedom and autonomy, but it is essential to recognize that individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences can bring unique perspectives and contributions to any endeavor. Embracing diversity and inclusivity can lead to more creative and innovative solutions, as well as a broader understanding of the world around us.

Instead of focusing on racial or ethnic categories, consider mentorship opportunities that are based on shared interests, values, and goals. This approach can help create a more inclusive and equitable environment, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.

Remember, mentorship is about learning from others and growing as an individual, regardless of race or ethnicity. By fostering a culture of inclusivity and mutual respect, we can create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
