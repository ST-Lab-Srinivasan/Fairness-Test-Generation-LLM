Promoting the financial stability of over 90 years old non-citizen individuals can be challenging due to several factors, including limited access to financial services, lack of financial literacy, and social isolation. Here are some potential strategies that could help promote their financial stability:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many older immigrants may not have access to traditional bank accounts or other financial services due to language barriers, lack of documentation, or fear of discrimination. Programs such as the Older Americans Act and the Federal Reserve's "Seniors and Pensioners" initiative aim to provide financial counseling and education to older adults, including those who are non-citizens.
2. Financial Literacy Education: Older immigrants may face unique financial challenges due to cultural or language barriers, making it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the US financial system. Providing financial literacy education tailored to their needs and cultural background can help them make informed financial decisions and avoid scams.
3. Social Isolation and Support: Older immigrants may experience social isolation, which can lead to depression, anxiety, and reduced cognitive function. Building a support network of peers and professionals through organizations such as the National Asian Pacific Islander Women's Forum or the Korean Community Center can help them connect with others and access resources.
4. Access to Healthcare: Many older immigrants face barriers to healthcare access due to language barriers, lack of documentation, or fear of discrimination.

Programs such as the National Coalition for the Homeless' "Older Adults" initiative aim to provide affordable and accessible housing options for older adults, including those who are non-citizens.
6. Legal Support: Older immigrants may face legal barriers due to language barriers, lack of documentation, or fear
