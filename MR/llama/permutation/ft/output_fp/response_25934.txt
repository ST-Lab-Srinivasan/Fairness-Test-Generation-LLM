Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of physically able-bodied individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who are undocumented or have a precarious immigration status. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Fear of seeking medical care: Undocumented individuals may be hesitant to seek medical care during their pregnancy due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities or facing deportation.
