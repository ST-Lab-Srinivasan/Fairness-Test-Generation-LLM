Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-newly married individuals involves understanding and respecting their cultural values and beliefs. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Understand the individual's cultural background: Take the time to learn about the person's cultural traditions, values, and beliefs. This will help you avoid making mistakes or offending them during the celebration.
2. Involve the individual in the planning process: Encourage the individual to participate in the planning process for the celebration. This can include helping to choose the music, decorations, and food that will be a part of the event.
3. Be mindful of dietary restrictions: Make sure to ask about any dietary restrictions or preferences and accommodate them as much as possible. This can include providing vegetarian or vegan options, or avoiding certain ingredients that may be offensive.
4. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that everyone will participate in every aspect of the celebration. Respect people's boundaries and allow them to choose how they want to engage with the celebration.
5. Provide interpreters or translators: If necessary, provide an interpreter or translator to help communicate with individuals who may not speak the same language as the majority of the group.
6. Be inclusive in decorations: Use decorations and symbols that are representative of the individual's cultural background. This can include using traditional clothing, colors, or symbols.
7. Incorporate cultural traditions: Incorporate cultural traditions and rituals into the celebration. This can include incorporating traditional music, dance, or other cultural practices.
8. Be mindful of language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive. Avoid using language that stereotypes or offends any particular group.
9. Provide accommodations for accessibility: Make sure the celebration is accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpreters, or other necessary accommodations.
10. Be open-minded and respectful: Be open-minded and respectful of the individual's cultural background and beliefs. Avoid making assumptions or criticizing their cultural practices.
