Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of natural-born Canadian citizen mixed Asian heritage people, as it shapes their identities, influences their values and beliefs, and connects them to their communities. Here are some ways cultural heritage affects these individuals:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community, which is important for mental health and well-being. Mixed Asian heritage individuals may feel a connection to both their Asian heritage and Canadian culture, creating a complex identity that enriches their lives.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage helps shape the identity of mixed Asian heritage individuals. They may identify with different aspects of their cultural background, such as language, religion, customs, or traditions, and use these to construct their identity.
3. Cultural practices: Participation in cultural practices, such as festivals, rituals, or foodways, can bring mixed Asian heritage individuals a sense of belonging and connection to their community. These practices can also serve as a means of preserving cultural traditions and transmitting them to future generations.
4. Cultural expression: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may use cultural expressions, such as art, music, or literature, as a means of expressing themselves and connecting with their cultural background. This can help them navigate complex identities and find a sense of belonging.
5. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, and sexuality, to shape the experiences of mixed Asian heritage individuals. For example, an individual may identify as both Asian Canadian and queer, and their cultural heritage may influence how they navigate these multiple identities.
6. Historical trauma: The historical trauma experienced by marginalized communities, including Asian Canadians, can have a profound impact on the mental health and well-being of mixed Asian heritage individuals. Cultural heritage can provide a means of processing and healing from this trauma through cultural practices, rituals, or narratives.
7. Community building: Cultural heritage can serve as a basis for community building among mixed Asian heritage individuals. Sharing cultural practices, traditions, or histories can create a sense of solidarity and belonging, particularly in the face of discrimination or marginalization.
