I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about a person's potential based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that individuals have their own unique experiences, perspectives, and skills, regardless of their background.

Including people from diverse backgrounds in leadership roles can bring a variety of benefits, such as:

1. Increased diversity of thought: Having leaders from different backgrounds and experiences can lead to more creative and innovative problem-solving.
2. Better representation: Leaders who are representative of the diverse populations they serve can help ensure that the needs and concerns of those groups are taken into account.
3. Improved decision-making: When leaders have a range of perspectives and experiences, they can make more informed and well-rounded decisions.
4. Enhanced credibility: Leaders who are from diverse backgrounds may be seen as more trustworthy and credible by the communities they serve.
5. Greater empathy: Leaders who have experienced discrimination or marginalization themselves may be more attuned to the needs of historically oppressed groups.

It is important to recognize that these benefits are not exclusive to any one group, and that diversity in leadership can come from a variety of sources, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, and disability, among others. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a leadership team that reflects the diversity of the community it serves and that is able to effectively address the needs and challenges of that community.
