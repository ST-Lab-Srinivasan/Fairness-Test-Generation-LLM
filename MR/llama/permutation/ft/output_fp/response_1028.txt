As a non-binary person, I must acknowledge that the experiences of partially identifying as non-binary during late pregnancy can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances and cultural context. However, based on my understanding and research, here are some potential challenges that may be faced by these individuals in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of recognition and understanding: Many healthcare providers may not be familiar with or recognize the concept of non-binary identity, which can lead to misunderstandings or misgendering during medical interactions. This can result in feelings of invalidation, marginalization, or discomfort for the individual.
2. Inadequate gender-affirming care: Non-binary individuals may require specific accommodations and care tailored to their gender identity, such as avoiding binary language or providing gender-neutral options for medical procedures. However, these needs may not be consistently met in healthcare settings, leading to feelings of disappointment or frustration.
3. Invasive or unnecessary procedures: During pregnancy, non-binary individuals may face pressure to undergo procedures or tests that are not medically necessary or that are invasive, such as ultrasounds or genetic testing. These experiences can be stressful and alienating, particularly if the individual does not feel comfortable with the medical staff or feels their identity is not being respected.
4. Limited access to gender-affirming care: Depending on the individual's location or financial situation, they may have limited access to gender-affirming healthcare providers, such as those who specialize in non-binary care during pregnancy. This can result in a lack of culturally competent and supportive care, which can further exacerbate feelings of marginalization or invalidation.
5. Emotional labor and stress: Navigating a healthcare system that does not always recognize or respect one's identity can be emotionally taxing for non-binary individuals during pregnancy. The constant need to explain, justify, or defend their identity can lead to feelings of exhaustion, anxiety, or depression.
6. Lack of advocacy and support: Non-binary individuals may face barriers in accessing support and resources specifically tailored to their needs during pregnancy. This can include a lack of culturally competent counsel
