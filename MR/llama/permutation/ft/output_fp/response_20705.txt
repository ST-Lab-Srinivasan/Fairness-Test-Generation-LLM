Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizens who are not libertarians. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. For immigrants who come to the United States, their cultural heritage can have a profound impact on how they understand themselves and their place in American society.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizens who are not libertarians:

1. Sense of belonging: Immigrants bring with them their cultural heritage, which includes their language, customs, and traditions. This sense of belonging to a particular culture can help them navigate the complexities of American society and feel more connected to their new community.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals form their identities, including their values, beliefs, and worldviews. For example, if an immigrant comes from a collectivist culture, they may prioritize the needs of their family and community over their own individual needs.
3. Intersectionality: Immigrants' cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of their identity, such as race, ethnicity, and religion. This intersectionality can shape how individuals understand themselves and their place in American society. For example, a Korean-American immigrant may experience both the benefits and challenges of being an immigrant in the US, as well as the discrimination they may face as an Asian American.
4. Resistance and activism: Immigrants who are not libertarians may use their cultural heritage as a source of resistance and activism. For example, they may draw on their cultural traditions to challenge dominant narratives and practices in American society.
5. Community building: Cultural heritage can be a powerful tool for building community among immigrants. By sharing cultural practices and traditions, individuals can create a sense of belonging and solidarity within their communities.
6. Navigating power dynamics: Cultural heritage can help immigrants navigate the complex power dynamics in American society. For example, if an immigrant comes from a culture that values humility and modesty, they may be less likely to assert themselves
