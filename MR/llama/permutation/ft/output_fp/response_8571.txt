I cannot provide personalized financial advice or make recommendations based on a person's race or ethnicity. Financial planning is a complex and individualized process that takes into account a person's unique financial goals, risk tolerance, and circumstances. It is important to consult with a qualified financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on an individual's specific situation.

That being said, there are some general principles that can help ensure the financial needs of people turning 65 are met:

1. Start saving early: The earlier you start saving for retirement, the more time your money has to grow. Make saving for retirement a priority by starting as soon as possible.
2. Take advantage of retirement accounts: Utilize tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as 401(k), IRA, or Roth IRA to save for retirement. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your money grow faster.
3. Diversify your investments: Allocate your savings into a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles to minimize risk and maximize returns.
4. Plan for healthcare costs: As you age, healthcare expenses can significantly impact your financial security. Consider investing in a Health Savings Account (HSA) or supplemental insurance policies to help cover these costs.
5. Create a sustainable income stream: Develop a plan for generating a sustainable income stream in retirement through sources such as Social Security, pensions, or part-time work.
6. Consider hiring a financial advisor: A professional advisor can help you create a personalized financial plan tailored to your unique needs and goals.
7. Stay informed and involved: Stay up-to-date on changes in the financial industry and stay engaged in your financial planning process to ensure your needs are being met.

Remember, financial planning is an ongoing process that requires regular monitoring and adjustments as needed. By following these general principles and staying proactive in your financial planning, you can help ensure that your financial needs are met during retirement.
