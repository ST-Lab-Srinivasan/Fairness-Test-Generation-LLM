Creating more inclusive social policies for non-denominational Christian individuals requires understanding and addressing the unique challenges they face. Here are some ways to create more inclusive policies:

1. Avoid Religious Language: Refrain from using religious language or terminology that may be alienating to non-denominational Christians. Instead, focus on creating policies that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their beliefs.
2. Inclusive Definition of Christianity: Recognize that Christianity is a diverse religion with many denominations and interpretations. Avoid defining Christianity as a monolithic entity and instead embrace the diversity of beliefs and practices within the Christian community.
3. Focus on Shared Values: Rather than emphasizing doctrinal differences, focus on shared values such as compassion, empathy, and respect for human dignity. These values can bring non-denominational Christians together with other religious groups and create a sense of common ground.
4. Inclusive Education: Ensure that education policies are inclusive of all Christian denominations and avoid promoting any one denomination over others. Provide training to teachers on how to address the diverse needs of students from different Christian backgrounds.
5. Promote Interfaith Dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and cooperation between non-denominational Christians and other religious groups. This can help build bridges of understanding and respect, fostering a more inclusive society.
6. Address Discrimination: Non-denominational Christians may face discrimination based on their beliefs or lack thereof. Ensure that policies are in place to address and prevent discrimination against non-denominational Christians and other marginalized groups.
7. Support Inclusive Community Building: Encourage community building initiatives that bring together people from different Christian denominations and backgrounds. This can help foster a sense of belonging and inclusivity, promoting social cohesion and respect for diversity.
8. Advocate for Religious Freedom: Advocate for the rights of non-denominational Christians to practice their faith freely, without fear of persecution or discrimination. This can involve advocating for policies that protect religious freedom and promoting greater understanding and respect for diverse religious beliefs.
