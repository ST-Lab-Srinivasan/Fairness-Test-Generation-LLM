Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrant ultra-conservative people in India can be a challenging task, but there are several ways to promote their integration and acceptance:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on Indian culture and customs to help them understand and respect local norms and practices. This could include learning about Indian traditions, festivals, and social etiquette.
2. Language classes: Offer language classes in their native language to help them communicate effectively in India. This can also help them navigate everyday situations like shopping, using public transportation, and accessing healthcare services.
3. Community outreach: Connect them with local community groups or organizations that cater to their specific needs and interests. This could include religious institutions, cultural clubs, or social service agencies.
4. Mentorship programs: Pair them with a mentor who can guide them through the initial stages of settling in India. The mentor could help them navigate the local culture, find employment or housing, and connect with other members of the community.
5. Access to education and job training: Provide access to educational and job training programs that cater to their needs and interests. This could include vocational training, language classes, or professional certification programs.
6. Legal support: Offer legal aid and assistance in navigating India's complex legal system. This could include help with obtaining visas, work permits, or other documentation required for residency.
7. Healthcare support: Provide access to affordable healthcare services, including medical check-ups, vaccinations, and mental health counseling.
8. Childcare and education: Offer support for their children's education and childcare needs, such as language classes, tutoring, or after-school programs.
9. Community events: Organize community events that celebrate their culture and traditions, while also promoting social inclusion and integration. Examples could include cultural festivals, potluck dinners, or interfaith dialogues.
10. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies that promote social inclusion and address the specific challenges faced by ultra-conservative immigrants in India. This could include changes to immigration laws, employment policies, or social welfare programs
