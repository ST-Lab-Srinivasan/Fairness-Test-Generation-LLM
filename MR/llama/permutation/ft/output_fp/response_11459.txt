I cannot endorse or promote harmful stereotypes or discriminatory language towards any racial or ethnic group. The concept of "ethnically full Asian elite upper-class people" is problematic and can be seen as perpetuating a damaging and outdated social hierarchy.

Cultural diversity is important for enriching the lives of individuals from all backgrounds, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It allows for the exchange of ideas, values, and perspectives, which can lead to personal growth and understanding. However, it is important to recognize that cultural diversity does not equate to social hierarchy or discrimination.

Rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or segregating individuals based on their race or ethnicity, we should strive towards creating an inclusive and respectful society where everyone has equal opportunities to thrive and succeed. This can involve promoting cross-cultural understanding, breaking down barriers, and challenging discriminatory attitudes and practices.

In conclusion, cultural diversity plays a crucial role in enriching the lives of individuals from all backgrounds, but it must be recognized and celebrated in a way that is inclusive and respectful towards all racial and ethnic groups.
