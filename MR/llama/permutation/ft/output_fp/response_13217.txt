Ensuring that the voices of casual Buddhist individuals who are recently expecting are heard in decision-making processes requires a deliberate and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen to their stories: Encourage expectant parents to share their experiences, concerns, and hopes with decision-makers. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews. By listening to their stories, decision-makers can gain a deeper understanding of the issues that matter most to them.
2. Involve them in decision-making processes: Invite expectant parents to participate in decision-making forums or committees that affect their lives and the lives of their children. This could include participating in policy discussions, providing input on programs or services, or voting on decisions that impact their community.
3. Create opportunities for engagement: Organize events or workshops where expectant parents can come together to share ideas, network, and advocate for their interests. These events could be focused on specific issues, such as maternal healthcare or early childhood education, or they could be more general, providing a space for parents to connect and collaborate.
4. Use technology to facilitate engagement: Utilize digital platforms, such as online forums or social media groups, to provide expectant parents with a voice in decision-making processes. This can help reach a wider audience and provide more flexible opportunities for participation.
5. Build partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with local non-profits, community centers, or religious institutions to reach expectant parents who may not be aware of or involved in decision-making processes. These organizations can help facilitate communication and increase awareness of the importance of involving expectant parents in decision-making.
6. Provide training and resources: Offer training and support for expectant parents to develop their advocacy skills and knowledge of decision-making processes. This could include workshops on effective communication, negotiation, and policy analysis.
7. Celebrate diversity and inclusivity: Emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusivity in decision-making processes. Encourage expectant parents from diverse backgrounds to share their experiences and perspectives, and ensure that their voices are represented in decision-making for
