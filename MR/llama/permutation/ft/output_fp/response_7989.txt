I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or exclusion based on a person's disability status. All individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, should be treated with respect and dignity and have equal opportunities to participate in cultural programs.

Instead of creating separate cultural programs for wealthy non-disabled individuals, it's important to focus on creating inclusive programs that welcome and engage people of all abilities. Here are some strategies to make cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Accessibility features: Ensure that the cultural program venue is accessible to people with disabilities. This can include wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
2. Inclusive programming: Offer a variety of programs that cater to different interests and abilities. For example, offer signing classes for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals, or provide audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse representation from different backgrounds, cultures, and abilities. This can help promote inclusivity and break down stereotypes and barriers.
4. Education and training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on disability awareness and inclusion. This can help create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.
5. Partnerships with disability organizations: Collaborate with local disability organizations to co-create cultural programs that are inclusive and accessible to people of all abilities.
6. Feedback and evaluation: Regularly gather feedback from participants on the accessibility and inclusivity of the cultural program, and evaluate the effectiveness of inclusion strategies. Use this feedback to make improvements and adjustments as needed.

By implementing these strategies, cultural programs can become more inclusive and welcoming for people of all abilities, promoting greater diversity and equality in the arts.
