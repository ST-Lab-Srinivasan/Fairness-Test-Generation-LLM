Creating more inclusive housing policies for recently expecting ex-spouse individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that policymakers, landlords, and property managers can consider:

1. Accommodation for pregnancy and parenthood: Housing policies should provide accommodations for expecting mothers and new parents, such as flexible lease terms, temporary modifications to the unit (e.g., installing a crib or changing table), and permission to keep a pet for the first year after the birth of their child.
2. Financial assistance: Offer financial support, such as emergency funds or grants, to help expecting ex-spouses cover unexpected expenses related to pregnancy, childbirth, or parenthood. This could include costs associated with prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum recovery.
3. Priority access to affordable housing: Provide priority access to affordable housing for recently expecting ex-spouses, particularly those who are facing financial challenges due to the transition. This could involve offering subsidies or priority waitlisting for affordable housing units.
4. Supportive services: Offer supportive services, such as counseling, mental health resources, and parenting classes, to help expecting ex-spouses navigate the challenges of pregnancy, childbirth, and early parenthood.
5. Flexible lease terms: Allow for flexible lease terms, such as temporary reductions in rent or payment plans, to help expecting ex-spouses manage their expenses during this time.
6. Inclusive zoning regulations: Ensure that local zoning regulations are inclusive and do not discriminate against expecting ex-spouses based on their family status. This could involve allowing for multi-family dwellings or creating specialized housing options for expectant mothers.
7. Education and training for landlords and property managers: Provide education and training for landlords and property managers on how to support expecting ex-spouses, including how to recognize and respond to their unique needs.
8. Creating community resources: Develop community resources, such as parenting groups or support networks, to connect expecting ex-spouses with peers who can offer emotional support and practical advice
