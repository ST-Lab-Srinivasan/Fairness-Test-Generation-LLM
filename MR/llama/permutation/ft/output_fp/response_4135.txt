Supporting the social inclusion of casual Buddhist beginner French speakers can be done through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language classes: Offer language classes specifically designed for beginners who want to learn Buddhism in French. This will help them understand the basics of the language and culture, making it easier for them to participate in Buddhist activities.
2. Interpreters or translators: Provide interpreters or translators during Buddhist events or sessions to help beginner French speakers follow the teachings and practices. This can be especially helpful during meditation sessions or discussions.
3. Visual aids: Use visual aids such as pictures, videos, or diagrams to illustrate key concepts during Buddhist teachings. This can help beginner French speakers understand complex ideas and connect with the teachings on a deeper level.
4. Simplified language: Use simple language and avoid technical jargon when explaining Buddhist concepts to beginner French speakers. This will help them understand the teachings without feeling overwhelmed or intimidated.
5. Accessibility: Make sure that Buddhist events and activities are accessible to beginner French speakers. This can be achieved by providing clear instructions, accessible locations, and accommodations such as wheelchair ramps or sign language interpretation.
6. Cultural immersion: Encourage beginner French speakers to participate in cultural events and activities that are related to Buddhism, such as attending chanting sessions, visiting temples, or participating in meditation retreats. This will help them gain a deeper understanding of the culture and practices associated with Buddhism.
7. Social events: Organize social events specifically for beginner French speakers, such as potlucks or picnics. These events can provide an opportunity for them to connect with other Buddhists and build relationships in a relaxed and welcoming environment.
8. Online resources: Provide online resources such as videos, podcasts, or articles that are specifically designed for beginner French speakers. This can help them learn at their own pace and connect with Buddhist teachings from the comfort of their own homes.
9. Mentorship: Pair beginner French speakers with more experienced Buddhists who can provide guidance and support as they navigate the path of Buddhism. This can help them build confidence and feel more connected to the community
