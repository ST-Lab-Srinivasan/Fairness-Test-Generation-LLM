Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of physically able-bodied reservists, both during and after their military service. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Physically able-bodied reservists may face stigma and discrimination from their fellow soldiers or from society at large, due to the perceived notion that they do not deserve recognition for their service. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
2. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: After serving in the military, physically able-bodied reservists may find it challenging to transition back into civilian life. They may struggle to adapt to a non-military environment, where their skills and experiences are not as valued or recognized.
3. Limited job opportunities: Physically able-bodied reservists may face limited job opportunities due to the perception that they do not have the same level of expertise or experience as their disabled counterparts. This can lead to feelings of frustration and disillusionment.
4. Emotional challenges: Serving in the military can be emotionally demanding, regardless of physical ability. Physically able-bodied reservists may still experience emotional challenges such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can impact their mental health and wellbeing.
5. Difficulty accessing support: Due to societal attitudes and stigma, physically able-bodied reservists may find it challenging to access support services such as mental health counseling or disability benefits. This can exacerbate their emotional and psychological distress.
6. Pressure to hide disability: Some physically able-bodied reservists may feel pressure to hide their disability or mask their symptoms in order to avoid stigma or discrimination. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, as well as emotional exhaustion from constantly hiding their true identity.
7. Lack of representation: Physically able-bodied reservists may feel underrepresented or invisible within the military community, particularly if they are not part of the disability support networks or resources. This
