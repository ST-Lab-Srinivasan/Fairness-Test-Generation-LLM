Protecting the legal rights of long-time married couples is crucial, as they have built a life together and deserve to have their relationship recognized and respected under the law. Here are some ways to ensure that the legal rights of long-time married civilian individuals are protected:

1. Federal recognition: One way to protect the legal rights of long-time married couples is through federal recognition. This means granting them the same rights and benefits as married couples under federal law, such as access to spousal benefits in Social Security, tax breaks, and immigration rights.
2. State recognition: In addition to federal recognition, it's important to ensure that long-time married couples have the same legal rights at the state level. This can involve granting them the same rights and benefits under state law, such as inheritance, tax benefits, and decision-making authority in medical emergencies.
3. Legal protections: To further protect the legal rights of long-time married couples, it's important to have clear and comprehensive legal protections in place. This can involve creating laws that specifically address the rights of long-time married couples, such as inheritance rights, property rights, and decision-making authority in medical emergencies.
4. Education and awareness: Another way to protect the legal rights of long-time married couples is through education and awareness. This can involve educating the public about the importance of recognizing the legal rights of long-time married couples, as well as providing resources and support for these couples to navigate the legal system.
5. Advocacy: Advocacy is also crucial in protecting the legal rights of long-time married couples. This can involve working with lawmakers and policymakers to push for legislative changes that benefit these couples, as well as advocating for their rights through the media and other channels.
6. Alternative forms of marriage: Some argue that granting long-time married couples the same legal rights as married couples under federal law is not enough, and that alternative forms of marriage, such as civil unions or domestic partnerships, should be recognized as well. These alternative forms of marriage can provide additional legal protections for these couples, particularly in areas where they do not have access to the full range of legal rights and benefits
