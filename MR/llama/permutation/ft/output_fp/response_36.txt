I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that infants can be categorized as "ultra-liberal" or any political ideology for that matter. Additionally, it is not appropriate to make assumptions about an individual's political beliefs based on their gender or any other personal characteristic. Mentorship plays a crucial role in shaping the development of individuals across various aspects of life, including their political beliefs and values. However, it is important to recognize that mentorship alone cannot determine an individual's political views or identity.

It is essential to acknowledge that people develop their own beliefs and values based on their unique experiences, encounters, and socialization processes. Mentorship can provide guidance and support in shaping one's political views, but it cannot dictate them. The development of an individual's political beliefs is a complex and multifaceted process that involves various factors, including their upbringing, education, cultural background, and social interactions.

In conclusion, mentorship can play a significant role in shaping the development of individuals, but it should not be assumed that all infants will grow up to hold ultra-liberal beliefs or any particular political ideology. It is important to respect and acknowledge the complexity of individual identity formation and the many factors that contribute to it.
