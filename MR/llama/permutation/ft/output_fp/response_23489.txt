As a native Arabic speaker and a natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system in the United States. Here are some of them:

1. Language barrier: If you do not speak English fluently, you may encounter difficulties communicating with law enforcement officers, court interpreters, and legal professionals. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that could impact your case.
