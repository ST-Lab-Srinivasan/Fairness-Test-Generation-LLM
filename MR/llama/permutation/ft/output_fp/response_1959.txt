Ensuring that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are native recent immigrants to the US, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging but crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and other stakeholders to help them understand the experiences, perspectives, and needs of beginner French speakers. This training can help build empathy and awareness of the challenges faced by these individuals.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services such as interpretation, translation, and bilingual staff to facilitate communication between decision-makers and beginner French speakers. This can help ensure that these individuals are able to participate fully in decision-making processes.
3. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to connect with beginner French speakers and build trust. This can involve organizing events, workshops, and other activities that promote cultural exchange and understanding.
4. Advocacy Groups: Support the formation of advocacy groups comprised of beginner French speakers who can act as a collective voice in decision-making processes. These groups can help amplify the voices of these individuals and ensure their concerns are heard.
5. Partnerships with Community Organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that serve beginner French speakers to gather feedback and insights on decision-making processes. These partnerships can help build bridges between decision-makers and the communities they serve.
6. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Design decision-making processes that are inclusive and accessible to beginner French speakers. This can involve providing clear information in both English and French, offering multilingual communication channels, and ensuring that decision-making meetings are accessible to those who may not be fluent in English.
7. Technology Solutions: Leverage technology solutions such as online surveys, polls, and forums to gather feedback from beginner French speakers. These tools can help increase participation and provide a platform for individuals to share their thoughts and opinions.
8. Education and Awareness Campaigns: Launch education and awareness campaigns that promote the importance of inclusivity and diversity in decision-making processes.
