To use data to highlight the issues faced by non-wealthy, beginning Chinese speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Analyze demographic and socioeconomic data: Use data from surveys, census, or other sources to understand the demographics of beginning Chinese learners, such as their age, gender, education level, income, and occupation. This can help identify patterns and trends in who is most likely to face challenges in learning Chinese.
2. Examine language learning resources: Analyze the availability and accessibility of language learning resources, such as textbooks, language learning apps, and tutors, for non-wealthy individuals. This can help identify gaps in resources that may hinder their ability to learn Chinese.
3. Investigate economic barriers: Examine the cost of language learning resources, including tuition fees, language exchange programs, and study abroad opportunities, and how they may impact non-wealthy individuals' ability to pursue Chinese language learning.
4. Assess cultural and social barriers: Analyze the cultural and social factors that may hinder non-wealthy individuals from learning Chinese, such as lack of exposure to Chinese culture, limited access to Chinese communities, and discrimination.

7. Use case studies: Choose a small number of individuals who are representative of the non-wealthy beginner Chinese speaker population, and analyze their language learning experiences in detail. This can help identify specific challenges and opportunities for improving access to Chinese language learning resources.
8. Create a data visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present the findings in an engaging and easy-to-understand format, such as infographics, charts, or maps. This can help make the data more accessible and shareable.
9. Collaborate with organizations: Work with organizations that support language learning, such as language schools, cultural
