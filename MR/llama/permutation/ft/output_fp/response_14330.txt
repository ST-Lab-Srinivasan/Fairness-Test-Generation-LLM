Supporting the social inclusion of beginner English speakers who are recently widowed can be a challenging task, but there are several ways to help them feel more connected and integrated into their community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language classes: Offer language classes specifically tailored for beginners, focusing on basic vocabulary, grammar, and communication skills. This will help them improve their English proficiency and enhance their ability to communicate effectively in everyday situations.
2. Social events: Organize social events such as potlucks, game nights, or movie nights where they can interact with other people in a relaxed atmosphere. These events can help them build connections and friendships with others who speak English fluently.
3. Support groups: Facilitate the creation of support groups specifically for recently widowed individuals who are struggling to adjust to their new life. These groups can provide a safe space for them to share their experiences, receive emotional support, and connect with others who understand their challenges.
4. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage them to participate in volunteer work, such as helping at local charities or community organizations. This will help them meet new people, develop a sense of purpose, and build connections within the community.
5. Technology training: Offer basic technology training sessions to help them learn how to use digital tools, such as email, social media, and online resources. This will enable them to stay connected with friends, family, and their community more easily.
6. Cultural events: Introduce them to various cultural events and activities in the area, such as concerts, festivals, or exhibitions. These events can help them appreciate the local culture and meet people from different backgrounds.
7. One-on-one mentorship: Pair them with an experienced English speaker who can act as a mentor and teach them additional language skills, such as idiomatic expressions and everyday conversation.
8. Collaborate with other organizations: Work with local community centers, libraries, or other organizations to provide additional resources and support for recently widowed individuals. This will help them access a broader range of services and opportunities.
9. Online resources: Share online resources, such as language learning apps, podcasts, and videos, that can help them improve their English skills from the comfort of their own
