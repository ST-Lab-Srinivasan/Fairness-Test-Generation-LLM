The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of non-socialist, non-high-income professionals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased Cost of Living: Military operations and defense spending can lead to an increase in the cost of living for non-socialist, non-high-income professionals. The government may impose taxes or inflationary policies to fund military operations, which can affect the purchasing power of individuals and their ability to afford basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare.
