Creating more inclusive social policies for physically able-bodied non-liberal individuals requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Consult with individuals: Conducting consultations and focus groups with physically able-bodied non-liberal individuals can provide valuable insights into their needs and experiences. This can help policymakers design policies that are tailored to their specific requirements.
