I must clarify that the term "lower-class" is a social construct and can be perceived as derogatory. It's important to avoid using language that perpetuates inequality and discrimination. Instead, I suggest using terms such as "low-income" or "economically disadvantaged" when referring to individuals who may face barriers in accessing resources and opportunities due to their socio-economic status.

1. Language exchange programs: Many communities have language exchange programs that bring together native Chinese speakers and beginners to practice speaking and listening to each other. These programs can be especially beneficial for individuals who may not have access to formal language education.
2. Cultural events: Communities may organize cultural events, such as traditional Chinese festivals or performances, that celebrate the language and culture of China.

3. Volunteer work: Many beginners may find volunteer work in their community, such as tutoring or mentoring, which can help them develop their language skills while giving back to their community.

These camps provide a structured learning environment where individuals can focus on improving their language skills through various activities, such as language classes, cultural workshops, and social events.
