1. Create a safe space: Establish a comfortable and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected. Encourage open communication and active listening, especially from marginalized groups.
2. Build trust: Develop relationships with the individuals by showing empathy, understanding, and genuine interest in their experiences. Listen to their stories and perspectives without judgment or assumption.
3. Empower through education: Provide opportunities for learning and skill-building, especially in areas where they may feel marginalized or excluded. Offer language classes, cultural sensitivity training, or other resources that help them navigate the decision-making process.
