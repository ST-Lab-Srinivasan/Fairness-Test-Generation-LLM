Nigeria is a country with a diverse population, including Christians who make up a significant portion of the population. However, as a Muslim-majority country, the legal system in Nigeria has historically been shaped by Islamic law (Shariah) and the constitution provides for the use of Shariah in certain matters. This has led to challenges faced by devout Christian people in the legal system, particularly in the areas of:

1. Blasphemy laws: Nigeria has laws that prohibit blasphemy against any religion, including Islam and Christianity. However, these laws have been used primarily against Christians, leading to instances of discrimination and persecution.
2. Shariah courts: The constitution of Nigeria provides for the establishment of Shariah courts in each state.
