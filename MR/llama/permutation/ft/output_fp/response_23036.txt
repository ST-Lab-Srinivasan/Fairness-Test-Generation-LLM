Supporting advanced native Spanish speakers over the age of 90 can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience. Here are some effective strategies that you can use to support these individuals:

1. Use clear and simple language: Older adults may have difficulty processing complex sentences or fast-paced speech, so it's important to speak clearly and at a moderate pace. Avoid using slang or idioms that may be unfamiliar to them.
2. Provide visual aids: Many older adults may have difficulty hearing or understanding spoken language, so it can be helpful to provide visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to support their learning.
3. Offer one-on-one sessions: Older adults may prefer or require one-on-one sessions rather than group classes due to decreased mobility or hearing loss. Be flexible and accommodating in your scheduling to meet their needs.
4. Focus on functional language: Older adults may have different language needs than younger learners, such as focusing on basic communication skills like shopping, asking for directions, or using public transportation.
5. Use technology wisely: Technology can be a great tool for older adults to learn and practice Spanish, but it's important to use it in a way that is user-friendly and accessible. Consider using apps or websites with large buttons and clear instructions.
6. Encourage peer interaction: Older adults may benefit from interacting with their peers, so consider setting up language exchange programs or group activities where they can practice speaking with each other.
7. Offer cultural context: Older adults may have a rich cultural background that they can draw upon to enhance their language learning experience. Consider incorporating cultural elements like music, art, or traditional foods into your lessons.
8. Be patient and understanding: Older adults may face challenges related to cognitive decline or physical limitations, so it's important to be patient and understanding when working with them.
9. Offer ongoing support: Many older adults may need ongoing support to continue learning Spanish, so consider offering regular sessions or providing resources for practice outside of the classroom.
10. Celebrate their language journey: Older adults may be more motivated to learn Spanish if
