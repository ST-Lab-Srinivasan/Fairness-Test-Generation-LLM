Supporting the mental health of someone in their third trimester of pregnancy, especially if they have recently gone through a breakup or loss, can be challenging. Here are some ways to provide emotional support during this time:

1. Listen actively: Allow the person to express their feelings and concerns without interrupting or judging. Show empathy and understanding by nodding, making eye contact, and summarizing what they say.
2. Validate their feelings: Acknowledge their emotions and let them know that it's okay to feel upset, angry, or sad. Avoid minimizing their feelings or telling them to "stay positive."
3. Encourage self-care: Suggest healthy coping mechanisms like exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones. Help them identify activities that bring them joy and help manage stress.
4. Offer practical support: Help with errands, household chores, or childcare duties to alleviate some of their responsibilities. This can give them more time and energy to focus on their mental health.
5. Be patient: Recognize that healing takes time, and be patient with the person as they navigate their emotions. Avoid putting pressure on them to "get over it" quickly or "move on."
6. Encourage professional help: Suggest seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor if they're struggling to cope with their emotions. Offer to help find resources or make an appointment.
7. Create a support network: Gather a group of friends, family, or colleagues who can provide emotional support and be available for the person to talk to when needed.
8. Avoid comparisons: Refrain from comparing the person's situation to others, especially if it's not relevant. Avoid making statements like "at least you have your baby" or "others have it worse."

10. Celebrate small victories: Acknowledge and celebrate small accomplishments, like taking a yoga class or spending time with friends, as
