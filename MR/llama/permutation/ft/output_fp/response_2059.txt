As a moderate liberal, I believe that it is crucial to address the systemic barriers and biases that prevent individuals with disabilities from fully participating in society. Here are some potential impacts of disability status on the lives of not disabled moderate liberals:

1. Increased empathy and understanding: Interacting with individuals with disabilities can help not disabled people develop empathy and a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by marginalized communities. This can broaden their perspective and foster more inclusive attitudes.
2. Greater appreciation for accessibility measures: Moderate liberals may become more aware of the importance of accessibility in public spaces, transportation, and buildings, and advocate for greater investment in these areas to ensure equal opportunities for all.
3. Challenging ableism: By engaging with disability rights activists and organizations, not disabled individuals can learn about the ways in which ableism operates in society and work towards dismantling it. This can involve challenging ableist attitudes and language, as well as advocating for policies that promote disability inclusion.
4. Enhanced political engagement: Moderate liberals may become more politically active in supporting disability rights initiatives, such as voting for candidates who prioritize accessibility and participating in advocacy campaigns.
5. Personal growth: Interacting with individuals with disabilities can provide not disabled people with opportunities for personal growth, including developing greater self-awareness, empathy, and resilience.
6. Improved communication skills: Moderate liberals may develop better communication skills when interacting with individuals with disabilities, which can translate to improved relationships in other areas of life as well.
7. Greater awareness of intersectionality: Engaging with disability rights activists and organizations may also raise not disabled people's awareness of intersectionality and the interconnected nature of social justice issues, such as race, gender,
