Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers who are not from upper middle-income backgrounds requires careful planning and consideration of the needs and preferences of these individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive community events:

1. Offer free or low-cost events: Many people may be hesitant to attend events that have a high admission fee, especially if they are from lower-income backgrounds. Consider offering free or low-cost events to make them more accessible to a wider range of people.
2. Provide childcare and transportation: For families with young children or those who may not have access to reliable transportation, finding ways to include them in community events can be challenging. Consider providing childcare and transportation options to make it easier for these individuals to participate.

4. Host events in diverse locations: Consider hosting events in different locations around the community to reach a wider audience. For example, you could hold an event at a local park, community center, or library to make it more accessible to people from different backgrounds.
5. Offer flexible scheduling options: Some people may have conflicting schedules or transportation issues that prevent them from attending events during traditional hours. Consider offering flexible scheduling options, such as evening or weekend events, to make it easier for these individuals to participate.
6. Provide interpretation and translation services: If you are hosting an event with a large number of non-native Spanish speakers, consider providing interpretation and translation services to ensure that everyone can fully participate.
