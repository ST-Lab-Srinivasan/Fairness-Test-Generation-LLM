Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner Chinese speakers, especially those who identify as Marxist. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes their experiences:

1. Revolutionary roots: Marxism has its roots in revolutionary ideologies that aimed to overthrow oppressive systems and establish more equitable societies. As such, cultural heritage can be seen as a symbol of resistance against oppressive forces, and many Marxist beginners may find solace in the historical struggles and achievements of their cultural ancestors.
2. Critique of capitalist culture: Marxist theory critiques the excesses of capitalist culture, including the commodification of culture itself. Beginner Chinese speakers who identify as Marxist may view cultural heritage as a means of challenging the dominant ideologies that perpetuate inequality and exploitation. By embracing their cultural heritage, they can subvert the dominant culture and create space for alternative forms of expression and identity.
3. Rediscovery of traditional values: Many Marxist beginners may feel disillusioned with the excesses of modern capitalist culture and seek to rediscover traditional values that prioritize community, mutual aid, and social justice. Cultural heritage can provide a rich source of these values, as it often embodies collective memories and shared experiences that promote social cohesion and cooperation.
4. Struggle for representation: Beginner Chinese speakers who identify as Marxist may feel marginalized or underrepresented in mainstream cultural narratives. By embracing their cultural heritage, they can challenge dominant representations of identity and culture, and create new stories and narratives that reflect their experiences and perspectives.
5. Resistance to cultural homogenization: In a globalized world, cultural heritage is often threatened by homogenization and commercialization. Marxist beginners may view cultural preservation as a means of resisting the erasure of diverse cultures and identities. By celebrating their own cultural heritage, they can contribute to a broader resistance against cultural homogenization and promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
6. Intersectionality: Beginner Chinese speakers who identify as Marxist may recognize that cultural heritage is intertwined with other forms of oppression, such as racism, sexism
