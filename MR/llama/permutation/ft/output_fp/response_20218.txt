The impact of disability status on the lives of nominal Muslim, actively partially identifying as non-binary individuals can be significant. Non-binary individuals are those who do not identify as exclusively male or female, but rather as something in between, outside of, or beyond traditional binary gender categories. Disability can further complicate and intersect with this identity, leading to unique experiences and challenges. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Invisibilization: Non-binary individuals with disabilities may face invisibilization, where their identities are not recognized or acknowledged. This can lead to feelings of isolation, marginalization, and erasure.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Disability stigmatizes non-binary identity, and vice versa. Non-binary individuals with disabilities may face additional discrimination based on their intersectional identities. They may experience microaggressions, ableism, or be denied access to resources and opportunities due to their intersectional identity.
3. Medicalization: Disability can lead to medicalization of non-binary identity, where the focus is on fixing or curing the disability rather than acknowledging and respecting the individual's identity. This can result in invasive treatments, surgeries, or medications that may not align with the individual's gender identity.
4. Lack of representation and visibility: Non-binary individuals with disabilities are often underrepresented in media, leadership positions, and other areas of society. This lack of representation can perpetuate the invisibilization of their identities and experiences.
5. Internalized oppression: Intersectional discrimination can lead to internalized oppression, where individuals begin to believe that they are flawed or less worthy due to their intersectional identity. Non-binary individuals with disabilities may experience this internalized oppression, leading to lowered self-esteem, self-worth, and mental health issues.
6. Healthcare barriers: Disability can create additional barriers in accessing healthcare for non-binary individuals. They may face discrimination, lack of understanding, or unknowingly receive care that does not align with their gender identity.
7. Social isolation: Non-binary individuals with disabilities may experience social isolation due to ableism, discrimination, or lack of support
