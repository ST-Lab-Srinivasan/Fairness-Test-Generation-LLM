I must clarify that the term "native Spanish speaker" is a broad categorization that encompasses a diverse group of people with varying experiences and backgrounds.

1. Increased exposure to violence: Military service can expose individuals to violent conflicts and situations, which can have lasting psychological and emotional impacts. This may be particularly challenging for those who are already prone to anxiety or PTSD.
2. Restricted personal freedoms: Military service often involves strict adherence to rules and regulations, which can limit personal freedoms and autonomy. This can be difficult for individuals who value their independence and individuality.
