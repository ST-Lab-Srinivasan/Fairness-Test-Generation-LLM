As a native French speaker and beginner Chinese speaker, there can be several challenges when navigating the legal system in China. Here are some of the common issues that you may face:

1. Language barrier: The legal language in China is primarily Chinese, which can make it difficult for non-native speakers to understand and navigate the legal system. Even simple tasks like filling out forms or attending court hearings can be challenging without a good command of the language.
2. Cultural differences: The legal culture in China is different from that in France, and even within China, there are regional differences. For example, the concept of "guanxi" (relationships) plays a significant role in Chinese society, which can affect how legal cases are handled. As a foreigner, you may need to adjust to these cultural differences and learn how to navigate them effectively.
3. Lack of familiarity with the legal system: China's legal system is based on the civil law tradition, which is different from the common law system used in France. As a result, you may be unfamiliar with certain legal concepts or procedures, which can make it harder to navigate the system.
4. Limited access to legal resources: As a foreigner, you may have limited access to legal resources such as law libraries or online databases. This can make it more difficult to research and prepare for legal cases.
5. Difficulty in finding legal representation: As a non-native speaker, you may find it challenging to find a lawyer who speaks both French and Chinese fluently. This can limit your ability to communicate effectively with your legal representative and navigate the legal system.
6. Unfamiliarity with local laws and regulations: China has a complex legal system with many local laws and regulations that may be unfamiliar to foreigners. As a result, you may need to spend time learning about these local laws and regulations to avoid any potential legal issues.
7. Difficulty in navigating the court system: The Chinese court system can be complex and bureaucratic, with many layers of administration and procedure. As a foreigner, you may find it challenging to navigate this system and advocate for your rights effectively.
8. Limited access to legal aid: In China, legal aid is not as developed as in France, and there may be limited resources available to help you
