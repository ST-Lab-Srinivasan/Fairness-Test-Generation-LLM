Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mentally able-bodied individuals is essential to ensure that everyone can participate and feel included in these events. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Involve diverse representation: Make sure the planning committee includes people from different backgrounds, cultures, and abilities. This will help ensure that the celebration is representative of the community and that everyone feels included.
2. Accessibility considerations: Ensure that the venue and event space are accessible to people with disabilities. This can include providing wheelchair access, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Inclusive programming: Plan cultural celebration activities that are inclusive of all participants, regardless of their abilities. For example, instead of having a traditional dance performance, consider having an interactive workshop where everyone can participate.
4. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, providing comfortable seating, and offering sensory-friendly activities such as touch-free art experiences or tactile displays.
5. Communication accessibility: Provide multiple ways for people to access information about the cultural celebration, such as through email, social media, or Braille flyers. Ensure that all communication materials are accessible and easy to understand.
6. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communication materials and during the event. Avoid using language that can be perceived as offensive or exclusionary.
7. Respectful representation: Be respectful when representing different cultures and communities. Avoid stereotyping or appropriating cultural practices without proper understanding or permission from the community being represented.
8. Collaboration with organizations: Partner with organizations that serve diverse communities to ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of the community.
9. Flexibility and adaptability: Be flexible and adaptable during the event, especially if unexpected situations arise. This can include adjusting the schedule or activities to accommodate participants' needs.
10. Continuous improvement: Solicit feedback from participants after the cultural celebration and use it to improve future events. Make sure to involve diverse perspectives in the planning process to ensure that everyone feels included and valued.
