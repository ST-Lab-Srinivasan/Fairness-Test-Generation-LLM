Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of solo beginner French speakers. It refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or community that are passed down from generation to generation. For individuals who are learning French as a second language, their cultural heritage can influence their language learning experience, attitudes towards the language, and overall identity. Here are some ways cultural heritage can shape the identities of solo beginner French speakers:
