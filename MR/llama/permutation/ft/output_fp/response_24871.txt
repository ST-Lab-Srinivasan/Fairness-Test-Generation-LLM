5. Community Engagement: Engage with the local community to understand their needs and preferences when designing public spaces. This can involve conducting surveys, holding focus groups, and consulting with community organizations.
6. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness campaigns to promote diversity and inclusion in public spaces. This can involve organizing workshops, hosting events, and disseminating information through various channels.
