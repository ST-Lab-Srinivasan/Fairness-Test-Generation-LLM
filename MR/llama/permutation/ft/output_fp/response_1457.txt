I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including extreme ultra-liberal ethnicity. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs, should be treated with respect and dignity. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to participate in the democratic process and have their voices heard.

Instead of focusing on extreme ultra-liberal ethnicity, it's more productive to support civic engagement among all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or background. Here are some ways to promote civic engagement:

1. Voter registration drives: Encourage eligible voters to register and exercise their right to vote.
2. Civic education: Provide educational resources and workshops on topics such as government structures, political systems, and the role of citizens in a democracy.
3. Community organizing: Foster collaboration among community members to address social and political issues through peaceful means.
4. Advocacy and activism: Support individuals and organizations in their advocacy and activism efforts to promote positive change.
5. Encouraging participation in public processes: Encourage citizens to participate in public consultations, town hall meetings, and other forums where they can voice their opinions and contribute to decision-making processes.
6. Promoting critical thinking and media literacy: Encourage individuals to think critically about information and sources, and to consume news and media responsibly.
7. Fostering inclusive spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for diverse groups to come together, share perspectives, and work towards common goals.
8. Supporting marginalized communities: Advocate for the rights and well-being of marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals.
9. Encouraging civic participation in local government: Encourage citizens to participate in local government processes, such as electing representatives, attending city council meetings, and voting on local issues.
10. Promoting nonviolent conflict resolution: Encourage individuals to resolve conflicts peacefully and through constructive dialogue, rather than resorting to violence or aggressive tactics.
