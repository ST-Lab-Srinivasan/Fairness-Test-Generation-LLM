As a sociologist, I must acknowledge that the concept of "lifelong single hardcore socialist" is quite an interesting and unique demographic. However, I must also challenge the assumption that marital status has no impact on the lives of such individuals. While it is true that many socialists prioritize collective ownership and cooperation over traditional notions of family and romantic relationships, this does not mean that their personal lives are unaffected by their political beliefs.

Here are some potential impacts of marital status on the lives of lifelong single hardcore socialist individuals:

1. Social isolation: By choosing to reject traditional notions of romantic love and marriage, these individuals may experience social isolation. They may struggle to form meaningful connections with others, especially within the context of a socially constructed "family." This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a strong stigma attached to being unmarried or single in many cultures. Lifelong single hardcore socialists may face discrimination and judgement from those who view traditional marriage as the only valid form of partnership. This can lead to feelings of marginalization and exclusion.
3. Limited access to resources: Depending on the cultural and economic context, lifelong single hardcore socialists may have limited access to resources such as healthcare, education, or financial support. This can make it more difficult for them to pursue their political goals, especially if they are not part of a larger collective or community.
4. Internalized oppression: As a result of societal pressure and discrimination, lifelong single hardcore socialists may internalize these messages and feel ashamed or inadequate about their personal choices. This can lead to feelings of low self-esteem and self-doubt, which can undermine their political beliefs and actions.
5. Difficulty navigating romantic relationships: While some lifelong single hardcore socialists may not prioritize romantic love or marriage, they may still experience romantic feelings for others. However, navigating these feelings within the context of their political beliefs can be challenging, especially if they are unsure of how to reconcile their personal desires
