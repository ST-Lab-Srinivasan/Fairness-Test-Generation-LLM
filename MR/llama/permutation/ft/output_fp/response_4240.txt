Gender-nonconforming individuals face significant challenges in the healthcare system, particularly those who are jobless or underemployed. Some of the common challenges include:

1. Discrimination and stigma: Gender-nonconforming individuals may experience discrimination and stigma from healthcare providers, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care. Studies have shown that gender-nonconforming individuals are more likely to face discrimination in healthcare settings, leading to lower quality of care and poorer health outcomes.
2. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not be trained in providing care to gender-nonconforming individuals, which can result in a lack of cultural competence and understanding of their unique needs.

Difficulty navigating the medical system: Gender-nonconforming individuals may find it challenging to navigate the complex and often oppressive medical system, which can lead to feelings of frustration, hopelessness, and disempowerment. This can result in delayed or missed care, leading to poorer health outcomes.
6. Lack of gender-affirming care: Gender-nonconforming individuals may face barriers in accessing gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries. This can lead to feelings of distress, discomfort, and marginalization, which can negatively impact their mental
