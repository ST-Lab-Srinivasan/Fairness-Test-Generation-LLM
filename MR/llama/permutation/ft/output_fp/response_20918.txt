Addressing the specific needs of Native American natural-born US citizens who are lifelong, single individuals in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their cultural background, socio-economic status, and unique experiences. Here are some strategies that can help address their needs:

1. Culturally responsive curriculum: Develop curricula that incorporate Native American history, culture, and values. This can include traditional stories, art, music, and language, as well as contemporary issues affecting Native communities. By making the curriculum more culturally responsive, students will be better engaged and motivated to learn.
2. Inclusive classroom environment: Create a safe and inclusive learning environment that recognizes and respects the cultural diversity of Native American students. This can involve incorporating traditional practices and beliefs into classroom activities, using visual aids that reflect Native American culture, and providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives.
3. Support for language revitalization: Many Native American communities are working to revitalize their languages, which were often suppressed or forgotten in the past. Educators can support these efforts by incorporating language learning into the curriculum and providing resources for students to learn their native languages.
4. Focus on STEM education: Many Native American communities face significant barriers to accessing quality education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Educators can address this gap by providing hands-on, project-based learning experiences that incorporate traditional knowledge and cultural practices with modern STEM fields.
5. Mentorship and leadership opportunities: Provide opportunities for Native American students to connect with mentors and leaders within their communities. This can help build confidence, self-esteem, and a sense of purpose, as well as provide role models and inspiration for future success.
6. Community partnerships and collaborations: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities and organizations to co-create educational programs and resources. This can involve working with elders, community leaders, and other stakeholders to develop culturally responsive curricula and activities that reflect the unique needs and experiences of Native American students.
7. Addressing systemic barriers: Educators must be aware of the systemic barriers that affect Native American students' ability
