The impact of marital status on the lives of physically disabled native Chinese speaker individuals can be significant and varied. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Physically disabled individuals, especially those who are married or in a romantic relationship, may face social isolation due to societal stigmas and discrimination.
