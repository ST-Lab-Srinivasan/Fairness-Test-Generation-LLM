Promoting the social inclusion of ethnically full African-American communities, particularly those who are not wealthy or multimillionaires, requires addressing the systemic barriers and structural inequalities that have historically marginalized these groups. Here are some strategies that can help promote their social inclusion:

1. Education and awareness: Educate people about the historical and contemporary issues faced by ethnically full African-American communities, such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources. This can help raise awareness and empathy among individuals and society as a whole.
2. Community-based initiatives: Support community-based initiatives that promote social inclusion, such as mentorship programs, job training and placement services, and cultural events that celebrate ethnic diversity. These initiatives can help provide opportunities for marginalized communities to participate in society and reach their full potential.
3. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address systemic inequalities and promote social inclusion. This can include pushing for affirmative action programs, advocating for fair housing policies, and supporting legislation that addresses racial disparities in education and employment.
4. Economic empowerment: Support economic empowerment initiatives that help ethnically full African-American communities access financial resources and start businesses. This can include providing access to capital, mentorship, and training programs.
5. Cultural preservation and representation: Promote the cultural heritage and representation of ethnically full African-American communities through arts and cultural programming, historical preservation efforts, and media representation that accurately reflects their experiences.

7. Community-led decision-making: Empower ethnically full African-American communities to lead decision-making processes that affect their lives, such as community planning and development initiatives. This can help ensure that their needs and priorities are addressed and met.
