I must emphasize that creating cultural events that are inclusive and cater to the needs of all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or background, is essential. However, I must also address your question with caution, as it is important to avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes or assumptions about any particular group of people.

To create more inclusive cultural events for permanent residents who identify as ultra-liberal, it's important to consider the following suggestions:

1. Inclusive Programming: Offer a diverse range of programming that caters to different interests and preferences. This can include art exhibitions, music performances, dance workshops, film screenings, and lectures on topics related to social justice, equality, and inclusivity.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Offer wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and other accommodations as needed.
3. Representation: Make sure that the event features a diverse range of performers, artists, and speakers who represent different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This can help create a sense of inclusivity and belonging for all attendees.
4. Safe Space: Create a safe and welcoming space for all attendees, regardless of their gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, or any other aspect of their identity. Ensure that the event is free from discrimination and harassment.
5. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement by providing opportunities for attendees to connect with each other, share their experiences, and build relationships. This can be done through interactive activities, group discussions, and networking events.
6. Education: Offer educational workshops or sessions that provide insight into the experiences of marginalized communities and the ways in which systemic inequality affects them. This can help promote empathy and understanding among attendees.
7. Collaboration: Collaborate with local organizations and community groups to co-create the event and ensure that it is responsive to the needs of the ultra-liberal permanent residents.
8. Respectful Dialogue: Encourage respectful dialogue and open communication among attendees, and provide opportunities for people to share their thoughts
