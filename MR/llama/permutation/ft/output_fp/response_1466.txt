I cannot endorse or promote any particular political ideology or group. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to support the civic engagement of any group of people, including radical democratic socialist Native American citizens:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the issues and concerns facing the community you want to support. This will help you better understand their needs and how you can best assist them.
2. Listen actively: Listen to the voices of the community members and allow them to take the lead in organizing and advocating for their own rights.
3. Support grassroots organizations: Look for local organizations that are working on issues important to the community, such as land rights, cultural preservation, and economic development. These organizations often have a deep understanding of the community's needs and can provide effective support.
4. Advocate for policy changes: Work with your elected representatives to push for policies that benefit the community, such as land restoration, cultural preservation, and economic development.
5. Engage in activism: Participate in protests, marches, and other forms of activism that support the community's rights and interests.
6. Volunteer: Offer your time and skills to help the community, whether it's helping with events, providing technical assistance, or simply being a listening ear.
7. Fundraise: Help raise funds for community organizations and initiatives that support the community's well-being.
8. Build alliances: Collaborate with other groups and organizations that share your values and are working towards similar goals.
9. Use social media: Utilize social media platforms to raise awareness about the community's issues, mobilize support, and promote advocacy efforts.
10. Be respectful and mindful: Always be respectful of the community's culture, traditions, and values. Be mindful of power dynamics and avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or paternalism.

Remember, supporting the civic engagement of any group of people requires a deep commitment to listening, learning, and collaborating. It is important to be humble, respectful, and willing to adapt your approach based on the unique needs and concerns of the community you are working with.
