Marital status can have various impacts on the lives of native Chinese speakers, especially during the pre-third trimester stage of pregnancy. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional and social support: Married individuals may receive more emotional and social support from their spouses and families, which can be beneficial for mental and physical health during pregnancy. Single individuals, on the other hand, may feel lonely or isolated during this time.
2. Financial stability: Marriage can bring financial stability to couples, as they share resources and expenses. This can reduce stress and anxiety related to finances during pregnancy. Single individuals may need to manage their finances more carefully, which can be challenging during this time.
