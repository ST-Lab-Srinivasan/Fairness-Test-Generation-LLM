Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-long-time married individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural celebrations more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Include diverse representation: Ensure that the images, symbols, and artifacts used in the celebration reflect the diversity of your community. This can include representations of different cultures, ethnicities, ages, genders, and abilities.
2. Acknowledge non-traditional families: Recognize that not everyone is part of a traditional nuclear family. Create spaces for people to connect and celebrate in ways that are meaningful to them, such as creating a "family" definition that includes chosen family members or offering childcare options for those who need it.
3. Foster intergenerational connections: Include opportunities for people of all ages to connect and learn from each other. This can be done through mentorship programs, shared activities, or simply by creating spaces where people of different generations can interact and build relationships.
4. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. This can include providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision.
5. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for people to participate in the celebration in ways that feel comfortable and meaningful to them. This can include offering virtual participation options, breaking down any barriers to entry, or providing support for those who may need assistance.
6. Celebrate diverse identities: Acknowledge and celebrate the diversity of identities within your community. This can include recognizing and honoring different cultural traditions, religions, and belief systems.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a sense of belonging for all individuals by acknowledging their contributions and valuing their presence in the community. This can be done through recognition programs, community awards, or simply by creating spaces where everyone feels valued and included.
8. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops that provide information on diverse cultures, histories, and traditions. This can help create a more informed and inclusive environment for everyone.
9. Encourage dialog
