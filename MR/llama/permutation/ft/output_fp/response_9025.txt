High-income professional post-transition transgender people may face a range of challenges within the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of understanding and support from healthcare providers: Transgender individuals often experience discrimination and lack of knowledge from healthcare providers, leading to inadequate care and poor treatment outcomes.
2. Difficulty accessing gender-affirming care: Even in high-income countries, transgender individuals may struggle to access gender-affirming care due to limited availability or lack of knowledge about best practices for transgender healthcare.
3. Mental health disparities: Transgender individuals are at higher risk of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety due to discrimination, stigma, and social isolation.
4. Hormone therapy accessibility: Access to hormone therapy may be limited for transgender individuals, particularly if they do not have adequate health insurance or face barriers in obtaining prescriptions.
5. Surgical accessibility: Transgender individuals may face difficulties accessing gender-affirming surgeries due to lack of availability or affordability, leading to delays or foregoing necessary procedures.
6. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the unique needs and experiences of transgender individuals from diverse backgrounds, resulting in inadequate care.
7. Insurance coverage disparities: Transgender individuals may face challenges in obtaining adequate insurance coverage for gender-affirming care due to discrimination or lack of understanding about best practices.
8. Stigma and marginalization: Transgender individuals may experience stigma and marginalization within the healthcare system, leading to decreased trust and satisfaction with care.
9. Lack of advocacy and support: Transgender individuals may feel unsupported and unheard within the healthcare system, particularly if they do not have access to advocacy groups or resources.
10. Limited research and data collection: There is a lack of research and data collection on transgender health issues, resulting in limited understanding of the unique needs and experiences of this population.

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that includes increasing education and awareness among healthcare providers,
