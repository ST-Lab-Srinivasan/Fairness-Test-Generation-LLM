Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for partially identifying as non-binary unemployed individuals requires understanding and acknowledging the unique experiences and challenges faced by this community. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive celebrations:

1. Involve non-binary individuals in the planning process: Assemble a team of non-binary individuals to help plan and organize cultural celebrations. This will ensure that the celebration is tailored to meet the needs and preferences of non-binary individuals.
2. Use gender-neutral language and imagery: Avoid using language or images that reinforce binary gender norms. Instead, use gender-neutral terms and representations that acknowledge and respect the identities of non-binary individuals.
3. Provide gender-neutral spaces and facilities: Ensure that there are gender-neutral restrooms and changing areas available during cultural celebrations. This will create a safer and more inclusive environment for non-binary individuals who may not feel comfortable using binary gendered spaces.
4. Offer gender-neutral clothing options: Provide clothing options that do not reinforce binary gender norms. This could include allowing attendees to wear clothing that does not conform to traditional gender roles or providing gender-neutral clothing items such as t-shirts with gender-neutral logos.
5. Incorporate non-binary representation in cultural celebrations: Incorporate non-binary individuals and their identities into cultural celebrations through art, music, dance, or other forms of expression. This can help to normalize and validate non-binary identities within the broader community.
6. Host events specifically for non-binary individuals: Consider hosting cultural celebrations that are specifically geared towards non-binary individuals. This could include events such as movie nights, game nights, or art exhibits that cater to non-binary attendees.
7. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to non-binary individuals who may be struggling with employment or other issues related to their identity. This could include providing access to mental health services, job training programs, or other forms of support.
8. Engage in ongoing dialogue and education: Continuously engage in dialogue and education around non-binary identities and experiences
