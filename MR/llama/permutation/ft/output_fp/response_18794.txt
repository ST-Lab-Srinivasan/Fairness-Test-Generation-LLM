It is important to recognize that the healthcare needs of individuals with known genetic conditions, including those from ethnic and racial minority groups, may differ from those of the general population. To ensure that the healthcare needs of no known genetic conditions in ethnically full Asian people are met, it is essential to provide culturally sensitive and tailored healthcare services.
