Supporting the community engagement of ethnically full African-American devout Muslim individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide culturally sensitive programming: Develop programs and services that are tailored to the cultural background and experiences of African-American Muslims. This could include Islamic education classes, mentorship opportunities, and community events that celebrate African-American culture and heritage.
2. Address systemic barriers: Recognize the systemic barriers that exist within the Muslim community, such as a lack of representation and inclusion, and work to address them. This could involve creating more inclusive spaces and opportunities for leadership, and actively working to dismantle racism and discrimination within the community.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create spaces where African-American Muslims feel welcome and valued. This could involve building relationships with local mosques and Islamic organizations, and creating opportunities for community engagement and collaboration.
4. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help African-American Muslims navigate the challenges they face, such as financial assistance, legal aid, and mental health services.
5. Promote interfaith dialogue: Encourage dialogue and understanding between different religious communities, including the African-American Muslim community and other faith groups. This could involve organizing interfaith events and conferences, and facilitating discussions and workshops that promote mutual respect and understanding.
6. Address microaggressions: Educate members of the Muslim community on how to recognize and address microaggressions, which can be particularly damaging to African-American Muslims. This could involve creating training programs and resources on topics such as cultural humility and inclusive language.
7. Provide safe spaces: Create safe spaces for African-American Muslims to share their experiences and feelings without fear of judgment or rejection. This could involve facilitating support groups and discussion circles, and providing a platform for them to share their stories and perspectives.
8. Advocate for policy change: Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and address the systemic barriers faced by African-American Muslims. This could involve working with local government officials, advocacy groups, and community organizations
