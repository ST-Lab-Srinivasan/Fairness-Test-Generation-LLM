I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI and cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote discrimination or exclusion towards any group of people, including elite leftists. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent worth and dignity, regardless of their political beliefs or socio-economic status.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the social inclusion of marginalized communities, such as:

1. Listening and amplifying the voices of marginalized individuals and groups in public discourse.
2. Advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and address systemic inequalities.
3. Providing resources and support to marginalized communities, such as access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.
4. Challenging and dismantling systems of oppression and discrimination that perpetuate inequality.
5. Engaging in dialogue and building bridges between different communities and perspectives.

By taking these steps, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
