2. Inclusive Learning Environment: Create an inclusive learning environment that promotes diversity and respects the individual differences among students. Encourage open communication, active participation, and mutual support among students.
3. Multisensory Approach: Use a multisensory approach that engages students through sight, sound, and touch. This may involve incorporating music, videos, and hands-on activities to help students understand and retain the material.
4. Assistive Technology: Utilize assistive technology tools such as text-to-speech software, speech-to-text software, and other adaptive devices to help students with physical or cognitive disabilities.

7. Practical Language Activities: Incorporate practical language activities that are relevant to everyday life, such as ordering food at a restaurant or shopping in a store. This can help students see the practical application of their language skills.
