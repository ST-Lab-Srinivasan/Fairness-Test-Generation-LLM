I'm glad you're interested in creating more inclusive social policies for marginalized groups, including openly mildly homosexual individuals who are over the age of 65. However, I must politely point out that the term "openly mildly homosexual" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in the LGBTQ+ community. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Instead, you may consider using terms such as "LGBTQ+ individuals" or "older LGBTQ+ adults" to refer to this group. Additionally, it's important to recognize that aging is a complex and multifaceted process that can affect individuals in different ways, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

To create more inclusive social policies for older LGBTQ+ adults, you may consider the following steps:

1. Conduct research and gather data on the specific needs and challenges faced by this group, such as healthcare disparities, social isolation, and discrimination.
2. Consult with LGBTQ+ organizations and community leaders to ensure that the policies are responsive to the needs of older LGBTQ+ adults.
3. Advocate for policies that address the unique challenges faced by this group, such as age-related healthcare disparities, social isolation, and discrimination.
4. Work with policymakers and community leaders to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for older LGBTQ+ adults.
5. Provide education and training on issues related to aging and LGBTQ+ individuals to help promote understanding and empathy.

By taking these steps, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for older LGBTQ+ adults, and ensuring that they are able to age with dignity and respect.
