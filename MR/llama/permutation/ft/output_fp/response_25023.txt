Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative, non-recently divorced individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs of diverse communities: Conduct research to identify the unique needs and preferences of different cultural groups. This will help you tailor your celebrations to be more inclusive and welcoming for everyone.
2. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee is diverse and represents various cultures, ages, genders, and sexual orientations. This will help create a more inclusive environment and reduce the risk of cultural appropriation or insensitivity.
3. Be mindful of language and symbols: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or hurtful to specific cultural groups. Use language and symbols that are respectful and inclusive of all cultures.
4. Incorporate diverse traditions: Incorporate traditions and practices from different cultures into your celebrations. This will help create a more diverse and inclusive environment.
5. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for individuals with disabilities or cultural practices that may require special considerations. For example, provide sign language interpretation or braille materials for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
6. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage cross-cultural understanding and exchange by providing opportunities for individuals to learn about each other's cultures and traditions. This can be done through cultural workshops, performances, or exhibitions.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in your cultural celebrations. Ensure that marginalized communities are not exploited or objectified for the sake of cultural diversity.
8. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Encourage ongoing dialogue and feedback from diverse communities to ensure that your cultural celebrations are inclusive and respectful of all cultures.
9. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt and change your cultural celebrations based on feedback and concerns from diverse communities.
10. Celebrate diversity: Above all, celebrate the diversity of cultures and traditions that make up your community. By doing so, you can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone.
