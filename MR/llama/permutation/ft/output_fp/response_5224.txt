Mentorship can play a significant role in the development and well-being of independent individuals aged over 90. Here are some ways mentorship can benefit older adults:

1. Social support: Older adults who lack social interaction or feel isolated may benefit from mentorship. A mentor can provide emotional support, offer companionship, and help them stay connected to their community.
2. Practical advice: Older adults may need guidance on practical matters such as managing finances, navigating technology, or coping with the loss of a spouse. A mentor can offer tailored advice and support based on their own experiences.
3. Personal growth: Mentorship can help older adults reflect on their life experiences and achieve personal growth. Through regular check-ins and discussions, a mentor can help an older adult identify areas for self-improvement and develop strategies to pursue their goals.
4. Confidence building: Older adults may struggle with feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem as they age. A mentor can help build confidence by providing positive reinforcement, recognizing strengths, and encouraging an older adult to take on new challenges.
5. Legacy development: Many older adults may be concerned about their legacy and how they will be remembered after they're gone. A mentor can help them explore their values, beliefs, and goals, and work towards creating a meaningful legacy for future generations.
6. Role modeling: Older adults may benefit from mentorship by observing the behaviors, attitudes, and habits of their mentors. By modeling positive behaviors and providing guidance, a mentor can help an older adult develop healthy habits and coping strategies.
7. Sense of purpose: Mentorship can help older adults find meaning and purpose in their lives, even as they face physical or cognitive decline. A mentor can help an older adult identify activities that bring them joy and fulfillment, and provide support as they pursue these interests.
8. Networking opportunities: A mentor may have connections within the community or industry that can benefit an older adult. By introducing them to new people and opportunities, a mentor can help an older adult expand their network
