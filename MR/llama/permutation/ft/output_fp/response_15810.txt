Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding and acceptance between different social groups, including immigrant and natural-born US citizens, as well as strongly homosexual groups. Cultural exchange involves the sharing and exchange of cultural practices, beliefs, values, and traditions between different groups.
