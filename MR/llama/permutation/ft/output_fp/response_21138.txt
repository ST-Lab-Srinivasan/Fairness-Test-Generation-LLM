I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including religious or racial discrimination, in the selection or inclusion of athletes in any professional sport. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to participate in sports and be considered for athletic opportunities based on their abilities and qualifications, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristic.

Promoting inclusivity and diversity in sports is essential to ensure that everyone has equal opportunities to participate and reach their full potential. Here are some ways to promote inclusion and diversity in professional athletics:

1. Remove barriers: Identify and address any obstacles that may prevent individuals from marginalized communities from participating in sports, such as lack of access to resources, discrimination, or financial constraints.
2. Provide opportunities: Offer training programs, scholarships, and other forms of support to help individuals from underrepresented groups gain the skills and experience needed to compete at a high level.
3. Encourage representation: Actively seek out and promote athletes from diverse backgrounds to participate in sports leagues, teams, and events. This can be done through targeted recruitment efforts, mentorship programs, and partnerships with organizations that support diversity and inclusion.
4. Address biases: Work to identify and challenge any biases or stereotypes that may exist within the sports industry, and create policies and practices that promote fairness and equity.
5. Celebrate diversity: Highlight and celebrate the achievements of athletes from diverse backgrounds, both on and off the field, to promote a culture of inclusivity and respect.

By taking these steps, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse sports industry that provides equal opportunities for all individuals to participate and succeed, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristic.
