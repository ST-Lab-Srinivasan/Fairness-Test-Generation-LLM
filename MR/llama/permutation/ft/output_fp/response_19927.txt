The impact of military status on the lives of happily long-time married couples over the age of 90 can be significant, as they have lived through several decades of historical events and social changes. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Loss of spouse: The loss of a spouse due to military service or death can have a profound impact on an individual's life, particularly in the early years after the loss. The grieving process may be prolonged due to the emotional and practical challenges of adjusting to life without a partner.
2. Financial stability: Military service can provide financial security through benefits such as retirement pensions, disability payments, or survivor benefits. However, these benefits may not be enough to cover all living expenses, particularly in the later years of life when healthcare costs and other needs increase.
3. Social isolation: Military couples may experience social isolation due to frequent moves, long deployments, or the loss of a spouse. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, disconnection from friends and family, and difficulty making new connections in later life.
4. Health challenges: Advanced age often brings with it various health challenges, such as mobility issues, chronic illnesses, or cognitive decline. Military couples may face additional stressors due to the demands of military service, which can impact their health and well-being in old age.
5. Nostalgia for past experiences: Military couples who have been married for many years may cherish memories of their time together during military service, including the camaraderie, shared experiences, and sense of purpose that came with it. They may feel a strong connection to this period in their lives and miss the excitement and fulfillment it brought.
6. Sense of duty and sacrifice: Military couples may feel a strong sense of duty and sacrifice due to their military service. This can lead to feelings of pride, honor, and a desire to give back to their community or country in later life.
7. Resilience and adaptability: Military couples who have been married for many years may have developed a high level of resilience and adaptability due to the challenges they have faced throughout their lives. This can help them navigate the physical, emotional, and financial challenges
