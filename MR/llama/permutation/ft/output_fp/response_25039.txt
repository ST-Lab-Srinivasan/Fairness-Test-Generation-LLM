I must respectfully point out that the question contains assumptions that do not make sense. Cultural diversity is a term that refers to the variety of cultures around the world, and it is not applicable to individuals who are 65 years old or older. Additionally, early pregnancy (1st trimester) is a stage in which a fetus develops inside the womb, and it is not possible for a 65-year-old person to experience this stage of pregnancy as they are well beyond their reproductive years.

Therefore, I must challenge the assumptions in the question that do not make sense and ask for further clarification or details. Could you please provide more context or clarify which population you are referring to?
