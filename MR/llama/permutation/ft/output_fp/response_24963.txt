As a beginner Arabic speaker in your late 30s, you may face several challenges when navigating the healthcare system in an Arabic-speaking country. Here are some of the common challenges you may encounter:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge is the language barrier. Limited proficiency in Arabic can make it difficult to communicate effectively with healthcare providers, understand medical terminology, and navigate the healthcare system.
