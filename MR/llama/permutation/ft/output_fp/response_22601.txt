This can lead to better understanding of the patient's needs, preferences, and cultural beliefs, which can improve the quality of care provided.

4. Enhanced patient satisfaction: Patients who receive culturally competent care tend to be more satisfied with their overall experience. This can lead to improved patient outcomes and increased adherence to treatment plans.
