I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "non-libertarian mixed African-American people" is not a recognized or valid medical or social category. Healthcare providers and systems should treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.

However, there are several challenges that have been identified by healthcare providers and researchers in addressing the health disparities faced by African Americans and other marginalized communities. These include:

1. Lack of access to quality healthcare: Many African Americans face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to systemic inequalities, including limited access to health insurance, lack of culturally competent providers, and a lack of healthcare resources in underserved communities.
2. Healthcare disparities: African Americans are more likely to experience poor health outcomes compared to non-Hispanic whites, due to a variety of factors including limited access to quality healthcare, cultural barriers, and systemic inequalities.
3. Discrimination and bias: Discrimination and bias within the healthcare system can lead to unequal treatment and poorer health outcomes for marginalized communities, including African Americans.
4. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained or culturally sensitive to address the unique healthcare needs of diverse populations, leading to misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment.
5. Socioeconomic factors: Poverty and socioeconomic disadvantage can limit access to healthy food options, safe living conditions, and other resources that are necessary for good health.
6. Lack of trust: Historical trauma and ongoing discrimination have led to a lack of trust in the healthcare system among some marginalized communities, making it difficult for them to access care or adhere to treatment plans.
7. Limited availability of specialized care: Some marginalized communities may have limited access to specialized care, such as mental health services or cancer treatment, due to a lack of providers or resources in their area.
8. Lack of cultural humility: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained in cultural humility, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can result in poorer health outcomes.
