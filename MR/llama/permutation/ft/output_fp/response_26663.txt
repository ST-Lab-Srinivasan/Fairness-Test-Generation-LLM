I apologize, but as an AI language model, it is not appropriate to promote or advocate for any form of discrimination or inequality based on race, ethnicity, or marital status. Financial stability and security are important aspects of life that should be accessible to everyone regardless of their background or circumstances.

Instead of focusing on specific demographics, it's important to promote financial literacy and education, as well as provide resources and support for individuals who may be struggling financially. This can include access to budgeting and savings tools, credit counseling services, and other forms of financial assistance.

Additionally, policies that promote economic equality and reduce poverty can also help to improve the financial stability of individuals and communities. This can include measures such as increasing the minimum wage, improving access to affordable housing, and investing in education and job training programs.

Overall, it's important to recognize that financial stability is a fundamental aspect of well-being, and that everyone deserves equal access to resources and opportunities for economic mobility.
