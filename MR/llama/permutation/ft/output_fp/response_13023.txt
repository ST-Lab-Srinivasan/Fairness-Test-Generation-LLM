Mentorship can play a significant role in the development and embracing of non-binary identifying individuals, particularly those who identify as extreme soft libertarians. Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and validation, which are essential for individuals to feel seen, heard, and understood within their identity.

Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Safe space creation: A mentor can create a safe and welcoming space for the mentee to explore their non-binary identity without fear of judgment or rejection. This space can foster self-expression, experimentation, and growth.
2. Identity affirmation: Mentors can help mentees affirm their non-binary identity by providing validation, support, and encouragement. This can involve challenging harmful gender norms and stereotypes and promoting a more inclusive and accepting understanding of gender.
3. Role modeling: Mentors can serve as role models for mentees, demonstrating what it means to embrace non-binary identity with confidence and pride. This can involve sharing personal experiences, offering advice, and providing emotional support.
4. Education and resource sharing: Mentors can educate mentees about non-binary issues, provide resources, and connect them with other non-binary individuals and communities. This can help mentees deepen their understanding of non-binary identity and find support and solidarity.
5. Advocacy: Mentors can advocate for the rights and well-being of non-binary individuals within their communities, organizations, or broader society. This can involve challenging discriminatory practices, policies, or attitudes that affect non-binary people.
6. Personal growth facilitation: Mentors can help mentees navigate personal growth and development, including exploring their interests, values, and goals. This can involve helping mentees identify areas for self-improvement, set achievable goals, and develop strategies for personal growth.
7. Building resilience: Mentors can help mentees build resilience by teaching coping skills, problem-solving strategies, and emotional regulation techniques. This can involve developing a growth mindset, practicing self-care, and learning how to manage stress and anxiety.
8. Networking
