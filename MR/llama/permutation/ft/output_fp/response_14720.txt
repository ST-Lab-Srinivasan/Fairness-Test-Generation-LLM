Creating more inclusive housing policies for active-duty older adults requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Age-friendly design: Ensure that housing policies prioritize age-friendly design, with features such as wider hallways, easier navigation, and adaptable layouts to accommodate mobility aids or wheelchairs.
2. Accessibility standards: Implement accessibility standards in the design and construction of housing units, including wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio signals for emergency alerts.
3. Inclusive zoning regulations: Update zoning regulations to promote mixed-use development, allowing older adults to live in walkable, mixed-age communities with access to amenities and services.
4. Affordability: Ensure that housing policies prioritize affordability for older adults, including rent control or subsidies for homeownership, to help them maintain their homes as they age.
5. Supportive services: Provide supportive services, such as transportation, meal delivery, and home maintenance assistance, to help older adults age in place comfortably and safely.
6. Intergenerational living: Encourage intergenerational living by promoting co-housing communities or shared living spaces that bring together people of different ages and abilities.
7. Education and outreach: Educate older adults, their families, and housing providers about the importance of inclusive housing policies and how to create them. Outreach efforts can help raise awareness and build support for more inclusive housing options.
8. Policy changes: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, or federal level to promote more inclusive housing options, such as rent control, inclusionary zoning, or age-based discrimination protections.
9. Collaboration with stakeholders: Engage in collaborative efforts with stakeholders, including older adults, advocacy groups, and service providers, to develop and implement inclusive housing policies that meet the unique needs of active-duty older adults.
10. Research and data collection: Conduct research and collect data on the housing needs and experiences of active-duty older adults
