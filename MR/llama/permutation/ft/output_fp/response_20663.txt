Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who have recently gone through a difficult experience like divorce, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically tailored to the needs of beginner English speakers. This will help them improve their communication skills and feel more confident when participating in decision-making processes.
2. Use clear and simple language: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be difficult for beginner English speakers to understand. Instead, use simple and clear language that is easy to comprehend.
3. Encourage participation: Create a safe and inclusive space where beginner English speakers feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Use icebreaker activities or other techniques to encourage participation and build trust among group members.
4. Use visual aids: Visual aids like pictures, diagrams, or videos can help beginner English speakers understand complex concepts and participate in decision-making processes more effectively.
5. Provide translation support: If necessary, provide translation support during meetings or discussions to ensure that beginner English speakers can fully understand what is being discussed and participate effectively.
6. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion and respect for diversity within the decision-making process. This can help create a sense of belonging among beginner English speakers and encourage them to participate more actively.
7. Build relationships: Take the time to build relationships with beginner English speakers, listen to their concerns, and understand their perspectives. This will help establish trust and make them feel more comfortable participating in decision-making processes.
8. Use technology: Utilize technology like translation apps or virtual meeting tools to facilitate communication and participation among beginner English speakers. These tools can help bridge the language barrier and ensure that everyone has equal opportunities to contribute.
9. Provide feedback mechanisms: Establish a system for providing feedback to beginner English speakers after meetings or discussions. This can help them understand how their input was received and acted upon, which can encourage them to participate more actively in future decision-making processes.
10. Celebrate successes: Acknowledge and celebrate the achievements
