I must clarify that the term "extreme moderate liberal" is not a commonly used or well-defined label in the context of Chinese language and culture. Additionally, it is important to recognize that individuals with diverse political views and beliefs may face different challenges in various legal systems. Therefore, I will provide general information on the challenges faced by native Chinese speakers in the legal system, without assuming any specific political ideology or label.

Native Chinese speakers may face a variety of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system (usually English), navigating legal procedures and understanding complex legal concepts can be difficult.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in many countries is based on Western legal traditions, which may not align with the cultural values and beliefs of native Chinese speakers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications during legal proceedings.
3. Lack of legal knowledge: Many native Chinese speakers may not have a thorough understanding of their legal rights and obligations, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, native Chinese speakers may face discrimination or bias in the legal system, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the language and customs of the host country.
5. Access to justice: Depending on the country and region, native Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as lawyers, translators, or interpreters, which can make it difficult for them to obtain justice in the legal system.
6. Lack of representation: In some cases, native Chinese speakers may not have access to legal representation, which can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
7. Limited availability of legal aid: Many countries have limited resources for providing legal aid or support to non-native speakers, which can make it difficult for individuals to obtain the help they need to navigate the legal system.
8. Different legal standards: The legal system in different countries may have different standards and expectations, which can be challenging for native Chinese speakers who are unfamiliar with these standards.
9. Lack of legal advice: In some cases, native Chinese speakers may not have access to legal advice or guidance
