Creating more inclusive social policies for non-binary individuals in Mexico requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this community. Here are some recommendations for creating a more inclusive society:

1. Legal Recognition: Advocate for legal recognition of non-binary gender identity, including the right to choose their own documents (e.g., passport, ID) without being forced into binary gender categories. This can be achieved by introducing legislation that allows individuals to identify themselves as non-binary on official documents.
2. Education and Awareness: Educate the public about non-binary identity, including its definition, experiences, and challenges. This can be done through campaigns, workshops, and training programs for schools, universities, and government institutions.
3. Healthcare Accessibility: Ensure that non-binary individuals have access to gender-affirming healthcare, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries. This can be achieved by providing trained medical professionals who are knowledgeable about non-binary identity and the specific healthcare needs of this community.
4. Identity Documentation: Provide non-binary individuals with accurate and inclusive identification documents, such as driver's licenses and vehicle registration cards, that reflect their gender identity without requiring them to choose a binary gender category.
5. Employment Protections: Enact employment protections that include non-binary identity as a protected category, prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity in the workplace. This can be achieved by introducing legislation that includes non-binary identity under anti-discrimination laws.
6. Public Spaces and Services: Ensure that public spaces and services are inclusive of non-binary individuals by providing gender-neutral facilities, such as restrooms and locker rooms, and using language that is inclusive of all genders.
7. Intersectional Advocacy: Engage in intersectional advocacy that takes into account the multiple identities and experiences of non-binary individuals, including race, ethnicity, sexuality, and disability. This can be achieved by collaborating with organizations that serve diverse communities and advocating for policies that address the intersecting forms of oppression faced by non-binary individuals.
8. Community Building: Foster community building initiatives
