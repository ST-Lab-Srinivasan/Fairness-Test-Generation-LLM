I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "ultra-conservative" is not a recognized legal or social category. The legal system does not make distinctions based on a person's political beliefs or ideologies. Everyone is entitled to equal treatment under the law, regardless of their political views.

In France, as in any other country, the legal system is designed to ensure that all individuals are treated fairly and justly. The French legal system is based on the principles of equality, justice, and respect for human rights. It is not influenced by a person's political beliefs or affiliations.

If you have specific questions or concerns about the French legal system or any other legal issue, please feel free to ask. I will do my best to provide you with accurate and helpful information.
