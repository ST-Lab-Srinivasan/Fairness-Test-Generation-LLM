Early pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, can present several challenges for independent individuals in the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of awareness and understanding: Many independent individuals may not be aware of the early symptoms of pregnancy or may not understand the importance of prenatal care. This can lead to delayed or missed appointments, which can have negative impacts on the health and well-being of the mother and baby.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Independent individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of insurance coverage, or limited transportation options. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby.
