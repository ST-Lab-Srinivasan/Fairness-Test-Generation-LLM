Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers with mixed Hispanic heritage can be achieved by taking into consideration their unique cultural background and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Make sure that the cultural programs include a variety of voices and viewpoints, reflecting the diverse backgrounds of the participants. This can be done by featuring presenters or performers from different Arabic-speaking countries and communities, as well as incorporating music, art, and literature from these cultures.
2. Be sensitive to cultural differences: Acknowledge and respect the differences between the participants' cultural backgrounds and experiences. For example, avoid assumptions about participants' beliefs or practices based on their ethnicity or nationality. Instead, ask questions and listen actively to understand their individual perspectives.
3. Provide language support: Offer interpreters or bilingual staff to assist participants who may not be fluent in Arabic. This can help ensure that everyone has equal access to the cultural program and can participate fully.
4. Create inclusive activities: Design activities that are accessible and enjoyable for all participants, regardless of their cultural background. For example, include group discussions, storytelling, or art-making sessions that encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives.
5. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the value of diversity and inclusivity in the cultural program. Encourage participants to learn from each other's traditions and practices, and highlight the richness of the Arabic-speaking world's cultural heritage.
6. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to participants who may be interested in learning more about Arabic culture. This can include recommendations for books, movies, or other cultural materials, as well as opportunities for further education or cultural exchange programs.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic power imbalances that may exist between different cultures and communities. Be aware of how these dynamics can impact the cultural program and take steps to address them, such as involving participants in decision-making processes and ensuring that all voices are heard.
8. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and inclusive environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives.
