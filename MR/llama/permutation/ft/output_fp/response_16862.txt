Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for individuals over 90 years old (or beginners in English) can be achieved by considering the following steps:

1. Accessibility: Make sure that the venue and event are easily accessible for seniors, with amenities such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide clear signage and directional information to help them navigate the space.
2. Language support: Offer interpretation or translation services for individuals who may not speak English fluently. This could include providing headsets with live interpreters or using visual aids such as gestures or pictures.
3. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, using dim lighting, and providing a quiet space for individuals who may be overwhelmed by loud noises or bright lights.
4. Simple activities: Plan cultural celebration activities that are simple and easy to follow, such as traditional dances, storytelling, or musical performances. Avoid complex or fast-paced activities that may be challenging for seniors to participate in.
5. Assisted participation: Provide assistive technology, such as audio describers or tactile diagrams, to help individuals with visual or hearing impairments participate fully in the cultural celebration.
6. Social support: Encourage social interaction among participants by providing opportunities for them to connect and engage with each other. This could include group activities, games, or discussions that promote conversation and bonding.
7. Respectful inclusion: Ensure that all individuals feel included and respected during the cultural celebration. Avoid any content or activities that may be offensive or insensitive to any particular group.
8. Technology integration: Utilize technology to enhance the cultural celebration experience, such as virtual reality experiences or interactive multimedia displays. This can help bridge the gap for individuals who may have difficulty participating in traditional cultural celebrations.
9. Community outreach: Reach out to local communities and organizations to involve a diverse range of individuals in the cultural celebration. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and ensure that everyone feels valued and included.
10. Adaptability: Be adaptable and flexible when planning the cultural celebration, taking into account the needs and preferences of participants
