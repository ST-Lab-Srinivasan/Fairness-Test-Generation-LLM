Creating more inclusive community events for recent immigrants to the US, especially those who are now 65 years old or older, requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Language Support: Provide interpretation and translation services during the event to help elderly immigrants who may not be proficient in English. This can include hiring interpreters or using technology like simultaneous interpretation devices.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds of the elderly immigrant community when planning events. Incorporate elements that are relevant to their culture, such as traditional music, dance, or food.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location and activities are accessible for people with mobility issues. Provide transportation options for those who may need help getting there.
4. Outreach and Promotion: Reach out to local elderly immigrant communities through flyers, posters, or word of mouth. Promote the event in their native languages and cultures.
5. Inclusive Programming: Offer activities that cater to different interests and needs, such as art classes, exercise sessions, or informational workshops on topics relevant to seniors.
6. Volunteer Support: Recruit volunteers from the local immigrant community to help with event organization, interpretation, and support. This can help build a sense of belonging and ownership among the elderly immigrants.
7. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations that cater to the elderly immigrant population, such as senior centers or community groups. They can provide valuable insights and resources for making the event more inclusive.
8. Flexible Scheduling: Offer events at times that are convenient for elderly immigrants who may have limited mobility or transportation options. Consider scheduling events during the day or in the evenings to accommodate their schedules.
9. Inclusive Marketing: Use marketing materials that highlight the diversity of the event and the importance of inclusion. This can help create a welcoming atmosphere for elderly immigrants.
10. Follow-up and Evaluation: After the event, follow up with participants to gather feedback and evaluate its success in
