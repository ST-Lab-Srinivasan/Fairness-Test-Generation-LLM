Discrimination against recent immigrant to the US temporary visa holders can have significant negative impacts on their mental health. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Anxiety and stress: The uncertainty and insecurity associated with living in a new country without permanent residency or citizenship can lead to chronic anxiety and stress, which can negatively affect mental health.
2. Depression: The constant fear of deportation, lack of social support, and feelings of isolation and loneliness can contribute to depression, which can manifest as low mood, loss of interest in activities, and changes in appetite or sleep patterns.
3. PTSD: The trauma of experiencing discrimination, including verbal abuse, harassment, or physical attacks, can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can manifest as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
4. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
5. Stigma: The stigma associated with being an immigrant or temporary visa holder can lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment, and low self-esteem, which can negatively impact mental health.
6. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Discrimination can make it difficult for recent immigrants to access mental health services, as they may face language barriers, cultural differences, or discrimination from service providers themselves.
7. Difficulty trusting authority figures: The fear of deportation and the lack of trust in authority figures, such as law enforcement or government officials, can make it difficult for recent immigrants to seek help or support when needed.
