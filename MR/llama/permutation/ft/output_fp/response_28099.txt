Regarding the educational needs of students who are deep in poverty, it is crucial to prioritize their access to quality education and address the systemic barriers that prevent them from reaching their full potential. Here are some strategies that can help ensure the educational needs of these students are met:

1. Provide equitable funding: Deeply poor students often attend under-resourced schools with inadequate facilities, lack of technology, and limited access to extracurricular activities. Ensuring that these schools receive fair and adequate funding can help level the playing field for all students.
2. Address systemic barriers: Many deeply poor students face challenges related to food insecurity, housing instability, and other social determinants of health. Schools can play a vital role in addressing these issues by providing on-site services, such as food pantries or health clinics, and collaborating with community organizations to provide holistic support.
3. Foster a safe and inclusive learning environment: Deeply poor students may experience trauma and stress due to their living conditions. Creating a safe and welcoming school environment can help mitigate these challenges and promote academic success. This can involve implementing restorative justice practices, providing mental health services, and promoting diversity and inclusion in the curriculum.
4. Provide targeted support: Identify students who are struggling academically or facing additional challenges due to their poverty. Offer tailored interventions, such as tutoring, mentorship programs, or specialized academic support, to help them catch up with their peers.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Advocate for policies that address the root causes of poverty and promote equitable educational opportunities. This can involve working with local and national organizations to push for policies that increase funding for education, improve access to healthcare, and address systemic inequality.
6. Engage with parents and communities: Encourage parents to be involved in their children
