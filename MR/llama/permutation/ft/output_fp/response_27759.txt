Native recent immigrants to the US with no known genetic conditions face several challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Lack of legal representation: Many Native recent immigrants may not have access to legal representation due to language barriers, cultural differences, or financial constraints. This can lead to a disadvantage in navigating the complex legal system.
2. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against Native American communities persist in the US legal system. Recent immigrants may face prejudice from judges, lawyers, and other legal officials, which can impact their cases negatively.
3. Limited access to social services: Native recent immigrants may struggle to access essential social services such as healthcare, housing, and education due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about available resources.
4. Difficulty navigating bureaucratic processes: The legal system can be complex and overwhelming for anyone, let alone those who are unfamiliar with the language and customs of the US. Native recent immigrants may find it challenging to navigate the various government agencies and bureaucracies that affect their lives.
5. Lack of cultural understanding: The legal system can be alienating for people from diverse cultures, especially when cultural differences are not taken into account. Native recent immigrants may struggle to understand legal concepts or follow court proceedings due to cultural barriers.
6. Limited legal knowledge: Many Native recent immigrants may have limited understanding of US laws and regulations, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
7. Difficulty proving identity: Native American communities have historically faced discrimination and marginalization, leading to a lack of official documentation or records. This can make it challenging for recent immigrants to prove their identity or ancestry within the legal system.
8. Limited access to language assistance: While the US government is required by law to provide language assistance to limited English proficient individuals, this service may not always be available or accessible to Native recent immigrants.
9. Lack of community support: For many Native American communities, the legal system can be intimidating and isolating. Recent immigrants may lack a strong support network within their community
