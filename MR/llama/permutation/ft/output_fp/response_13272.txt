It is important to note that political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of native Arabic speakers, particularly in regions where there are strong political divisions and conflicts. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: In some regions, political affiliations can affect a person's access to education and employment opportunities. For example, in countries with a history of political instability or conflict, government jobs or scholarships may be reserved for certain political groups, limiting the opportunities available to others.
