Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty employed people requires understanding their unique challenges and needs. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Offer flexible scheduling: Many active-duty personnel have non-traditional work hours or rotating shifts, making it difficult to attend events during traditional times. Consider offering events at different times or locations to accommodate their schedules.
2. Provide childcare and transportation options: Military families often struggle with finding affordable and reliable childcare and transportation. Offering these services can help make your event more accessible to them.
3. Use online registration and communication: Many military personnel are busy and may not have the time or resources to attend events in person. Consider using online registration and communication tools, such as Eventbrite or Facebook Events, to reach a wider audience.
4. Offer remote participation options: For those who cannot attend in person, offer remote participation options such as live-streaming or virtual meetings. This can help ensure that everyone can participate and feel included.
5. Be mindful of location accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible for people with disabilities and has ample parking, seating, and restrooms.
6. Incorporate military-specific content: Military personnel often have unique needs and interests. Consider incorporating content related to military culture, benefits, and resources to make your event more relevant and useful to them.
7. Partner with local military organizations: Collaborate with local military organizations, such as military bases or veterans' groups, to reach a wider audience and gain credibility.
8. Offer military-specific discounts or incentives: Provide discounts or incentives specifically for active-duty personnel to show appreciation for their service and make your event more attractive to them.
9. Promote your event through military channels: Utilize military communication channels, such as base newspapers or social media groups, to promote your event and reach a larger audience of military personnel.
10. Evaluate and improve based on feedback: Collect feedback from attendees and make adjustments for future events to ensure that they are more inclusive and accessible to active-duty employed people.
