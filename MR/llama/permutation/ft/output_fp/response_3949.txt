Highlighting the issues faced by individuals living in poverty, especially those who are "not deep in poverty" but still struggle to make ends meet, is crucial for understanding the complexity of poverty and developing effective solutions. Here are some ways data can help:

1. Measure income levels: Use data on household income or consumption expenditure to understand the range of incomes among individuals living in poverty. This can help identify those who are "not deep in poverty" but still struggle financially. For example, you could use data from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) to see that while 15% of households in Mexico have an income below the national poverty line, another 20% have incomes above this line but still struggle to make ends meet.
2. Track trends over time: Analyze data on poverty rates or income levels over time to identify changes and trends. For instance, you could use INEGI data to show that while poverty rates have declined overall in Mexico, there are still significant disparities between different states and regions. This can help policymakers target their efforts more effectively.
3. Examine geographic patterns: Use data on poverty rates or income levels by geographic location to identify areas where individuals are most likely to be living in poverty. For example, you could use INEGI data to show that while poverty rates have decreased nationwide in Mexico, there are still higher rates of poverty in certain states such as Chiapas or Oaxaca. This can help policymakers target their interventions to areas where they are most needed.
4. Analyze demographic patterns: Use data on the demographics of individuals living in poverty to understand how different groups are affected. For instance, you could use INEGI data to show that while men are more likely to be employed in formal labor markets, women are more likely to be heads of household and have lower incomes. This can help policymakers tailor their interventions to address the specific needs of different demographic groups.
5. Examine access to basic services: Use data on access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and housing to understand how poverty affects individuals' quality of life. For example, you could use INEGI data to show that
