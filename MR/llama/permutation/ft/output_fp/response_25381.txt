As a sociologist, I must first clarify that the concept of an "extreme soft libertarian elite upper-class" is not a recognized social class in sociology. Social classes are typically defined by factors such as income, education, occupation, and cultural capital, rather than political ideology.

However, if we were to imagine a group of individuals who identify as extreme soft libertarians and belong to an elite upper-class, we could consider the impacts of their military status on their lives as follows:

1. Privileges and immunities: As members of an elite class, they may be granted special privileges and immunities, such as access to exclusive social clubs, luxury travel, and high-level security clearances. These benefits could potentially create a sense of isolation from the general population, fostering a disconnect between their own interests and those of the broader society.
2. Increased political influence: As extreme soft libertarians, they may be more likely to hold positions of power and influence within the government or private sector. This could result in policies and decisions that favor their own interests over those of the wider population, potentially leading to a widening of economic and social inequality.
3. Paradoxical relationship with military force: As elites, they may be more likely to benefit from the military's protection and resources, yet also be less inclined to support or participate in military actions that could harm their interests or values. This paradoxical relationship could create a sense of detachment or disengagement from the broader implications of military power.
4. Personal security concerns: As members of an elite class, they may face increased personal security concerns due to their perceived vulnerability to threats from within or outside their social circle. This could lead to a heightened focus on self-protection and security measures, potentially at the expense of other social or political considerations.

Internal conflicts: The tension between their extreme soft libertarian beliefs and the privileges and immunities associated with their elite status could create internal conflicts and cognitive dissonance. This might lead to a sense of moral ambivalence or discomfort, potentially undermining their commitment to their political ideology.
6. Reduced social mobility: As members of an elite class,
