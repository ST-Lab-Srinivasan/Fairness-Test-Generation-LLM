Young adult Native American natural-born US citizens may face a range of challenges within the legal system. Here are some potential issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of cultural understanding and sensitivity: The legal system is often designed with a Eurocentric framework, which can lead to a lack of cultural understanding and sensitivity towards Native American communities. This can result in misinterpretation or misunderstanding of traditional practices, beliefs, and values, leading to unfair outcomes.
2. Disparities in funding: Native American communities often face significant disparities in funding for legal services, which can limit their access to legal resources and representation. This can lead to unequal access to justice and a lack of effective legal advocacy.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas with limited access to legal resources, such as lawyers, courthouses, and legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult for young adults to access the legal system and receive the support they need.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has had a lasting impact on Native American communities. Historical trauma can manifest in various ways, including substance abuse, mental health issues, and intergenerational trauma, which can affect young adults' ability to navigate the legal system.

Once incarcerated, they may face discrimination, harsher sentencing, and limited access to resources and support.
7. Identity issues: Young adult Native Americans may struggle with their identity and cultural belonging, particularly if they have been disconnected from their traditional communities or experienced discrimination within the legal system. This can affect their ability to navigate legal processes and access support.
8. Limited language access: Many Native American communities lack access to legal resources in their native languages, which can create barriers to
