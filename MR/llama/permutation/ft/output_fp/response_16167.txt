Creating more inclusive housing policies for individuals in the third trimester of pregnancy and recent long-term widows requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive housing policies:

1. Accommodate Pregnancy: Ensure that your housing policies acknowledge and accommodate the unique needs of pregnant individuals, including those in their third trimester. Provide additional support and resources to help them navigate any challenges they may face during this time.
2. Provide Accessible Housing: Ensure that your housing policies provide accessible and adaptable housing options for individuals with disabilities, including those who are recently widowed and may require additional support. This can include features such as wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
3. Address Discrimination: Ensure that your housing policies do not discriminate against any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic. Provide training to staff and landlords to address any biases or stereotypes that may exist.
4. Foster Community: Create a sense of community within your housing policies by promoting social connections and inclusive programming. Encourage residents to get to know one another and build relationships, which can help to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness.
5. Provide Support Services: Offer support services such as counseling, financial planning, and legal aid to help individuals navigate any challenges they may face during this time. These services can be particularly important for recently widowed individuals who may require additional support.
6. Ensure Accessibility of Amenities: Ensure that all amenities within the housing complex are accessible and inclusive for residents with disabilities, including those in their third trimester of pregnancy. This can include things like wheelchair-accessible elevators, adaptable kitchens, and Braille signage on appliances and fixtures.
7. Create a Welcoming Environment: Foster a welcoming environment within the housing complex by promoting diversity and inclusivity. Encourage residents to express themselves freely and without fear of discrimination or harassment.
8. Address Safety Concerns: Ensure that your housing policies address safety concerns
