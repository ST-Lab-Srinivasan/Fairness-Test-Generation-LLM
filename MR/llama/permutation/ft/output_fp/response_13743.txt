Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Term Widowed Beginner Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those who have experienced significant life events such as widowhood. For long-term widowed beginner Spanish speakers, cultural heritage can influence their sense of self and belonging. This paper will explore how cultural heritage impacts the identities of these individuals and how it shapes their experiences with the Spanish language.

Theories:

1. Identity theory: This theory posits that individuals form their identities through their interactions with their environment, including cultural norms and values. Long-term widowed beginner Spanish speakers may use cultural heritage to form their identities, especially if they are part of a minority group.
2. Intersectionality theory: This theory argues that individuals' identities are shaped by multiple factors, including race, gender, class, and sexuality. Long-term widowed beginner Spanish speakers may experience intersectionality in their identities, as they navigate different cultural contexts and social roles.
3. Critical Race Theory: This theory examines how power structures and systems of oppression impact individuals' experiences and opportunities. Long-term widowed beginner Spanish speakers may face discrimination and marginalization based on their race, ethnicity, or nationality, which can shape their identities and experiences with the Spanish language.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from long-term widowed beginner Spanish speakers. Participants will be recruited through community centers, support groups, and online forums. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for an in-depth analysis of the participants' experiences and perspectives.

Results:
The results of this study will highlight the ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of long-term widowed beginner Spanish speakers. The findings will indicate how participants' cultural backgrounds influence their language learning experiences, including their motivations, challenges, and achievements. The study will also reveal how cultural heritage impacts participants' sense of belonging and identity formation in the Spanish-speaking community.
