Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-binary individuals requires understanding, respect, and intention. Here are some steps you can take to make your celebrations more welcoming:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences of non-binary individuals, their history, and the challenges they face. This will help you create a safe and inclusive space for them.
