As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "deeply lower-class" is problematic and can be perceived as stigmatizing or discriminatory. It is important to recognize that socioeconomic status does not define a person's worth, value, or potential for success.

Instead of using such labels, it is more accurate and respectful to acknowledge the systemic barriers and challenges faced by individuals from lower-income backgrounds in accessing legal services and navigating the criminal justice system. These challenges may include:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Individuals from lower-income backgrounds may face barriers in accessing legal representation, including lack of financial resources, limited availability of free or low-cost legal clinics, and inadequate access to technology for online legal services.
2. Lack of knowledge about the legal system: Many individuals from lower-income backgrounds may be unfamiliar with the legal system and its processes, which can lead to confusion and disadvantage during legal proceedings.
3. Bias and stereotyping: Unfortunately, there are instances of bias and stereotyping within the legal system, which can affect individuals from lower-income backgrounds and lead to unfair treatment.
4. Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status: Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status can also occur within the legal system, which can result in unequal treatment and outcomes for individuals from marginalized communities.
5. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system may not always be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds and needs of individuals from diverse communities, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can impact outcomes.
6. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods: Individuals from lower-income backgrounds may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation or arbitration, which can result in fewer options for resolving legal disputes outside of the traditional court system.
7. Lack of advocacy and support: Finally, individuals from lower-income backgrounds may not have access to adequate advocacy and support services, including legal aid organizations, community groups, and social service agencies,
