Creating inclusive community programs for recently divorced, multiple times ultra-conservative individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these individuals feel welcome and included:

1. Understand their beliefs and values: It's essential to understand the beliefs and values of this group to create programs that cater to their needs. Listen to their perspectives, and be respectful of their convictions.
2. Focus on shared interests: While ultra-conservative individuals may have different beliefs and values, they may share common interests such as volunteering, gardening, or cooking. Create programs that focus on these shared interests to bring them together.
3. Provide a safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and feelings. This can be done by providing a confidential setting, using gender-neutral language, and being sensitive to their cultural and religious beliefs.
4. Offer guidance and support: Divorce can be a challenging experience, especially for those who have been married multiple times. Provide guidance and support through workshops, counseling sessions, or mentorship programs. This can help them navigate the divorce process and cope with the emotional impact.
5. Promote self-care: Encourage participants to prioritize self-care by engaging in activities that promote relaxation and stress relief, such as yoga, meditation, or art therapy.
6. Involve them in decision-making: Give ultra-conservative individuals a voice in program planning and decision-making. This can help them feel more invested in the program and more likely to participate.
7. Provide resources and referrals: Offer resources and referrals that cater to their specific needs, such as financial management, legal aid, or spiritual support.
8. Be patient and understanding: Divorce can be a long and difficult process, especially for those who have been married multiple times. Be patient and understanding, and recognize that healing takes time.
9. Respect their boundaries: Respect the boundaries of ultra-conservative individuals by not pushing them to discuss topics they are uncomfortable with or engaging in activities that go against their beliefs.
