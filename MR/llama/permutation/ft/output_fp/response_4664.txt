It is important to recognize that the experiences of Asian individuals and communities within the healthcare system can vary greatly based on a range of factors, including socioeconomic status, cultural background, and access to resources. Here are some challenges faced by not just above poverty line ethnically full Asian people in the healthcare system:

1. Language barriers: Many Asian individuals and communities may face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, particularly if they do not speak English fluently or at all. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and delays in diagnosis and treatment.
2. Cultural differences: Asian cultures have unique beliefs, values, and practices surrounding health and illness. Healthcare providers may need to be aware of these cultural differences and adapt their communication styles and approaches to care accordingly.
