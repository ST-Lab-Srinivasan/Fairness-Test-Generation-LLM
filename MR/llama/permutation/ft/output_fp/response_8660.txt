I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about any group of people based on their disability status. Temporary visa holders are individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and abilities, and it is important to treat them with dignity and respect regardless of their disability status.

It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Discrimination against any group of people, including those with disabilities, is illegal and goes against basic human rights and principles of inclusivity and accessibility.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about temporary visa holders based on their disability status, it is important to focus on creating an inclusive and accessible environment for all individuals. This includes providing accommodations and supports that promote equality and inclusion, such as accessible facilities, communication support, and adaptive equipment.

In summary, it is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their disability status or any other characteristic. By promoting inclusivity and accessibility, we can create a society that values and supports the contributions of all individuals, including temporary visa holders.
