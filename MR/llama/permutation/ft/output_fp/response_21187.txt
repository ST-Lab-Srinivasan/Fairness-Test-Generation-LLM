The impact of political affiliation on the lives of non-abled people in Spain can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Depending on the political ideology of the government, there may be differences in the accessibility and quality of healthcare for people with disabilities. For example, if a conservative government is in power, they may prioritize cost-cutting measures that could result in reduced funding for disability services or less accessible healthcare for people with disabilities.
