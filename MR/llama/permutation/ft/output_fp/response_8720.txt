Protecting the legal rights of lower-class devout Christians, or any religious group for that matter, requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some strategies that can help ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Education and awareness: Provide access to education and information on legal rights and protections, particularly in rural areas where access to resources may be limited. This can help individuals understand their rights and how to advocate for themselves.
