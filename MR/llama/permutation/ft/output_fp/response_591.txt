Promoting social inclusion of ethnically full African-American lower-class communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities that have contributed to their marginalization. Here are some strategies that can help promote social inclusion:

1. Education and job training programs: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that prepare individuals for better-paying jobs and career advancement opportunities. This can help reduce poverty and inequality among African-American communities.
2. Community development initiatives: Invest in community development initiatives that create job opportunities, improve housing conditions, and provide access to healthcare and other essential services. This can help build stronger, more resilient communities and promote social inclusion.
3. Criminal justice reform: Address the disproportionate representation of African-Americans in the criminal justice system through reforms that reduce racial disparities in policing, sentencing, and prison conditions. This can help reduce the number of African-Americans who are incarcerated or otherwise impacted by the criminal justice system.
4. Healthcare access: Ensure equal access to quality healthcare for all members of marginalized communities. This can involve increasing funding for community health clinics, expanding Medicaid coverage, and addressing systemic barriers to healthcare access.
5. Cultural preservation and representation: Promote the cultural heritage and representation of African-American communities through initiatives such as arts programs, historical preservation efforts, and media representation that reflects the diversity of African-American experiences.
6. Economic empowerment: Support economic empowerment initiatives that help African-Americans start businesses, access capital, and build wealth. This can involve providing mentorship, training, and access to resources and networks.
7. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies and laws that promote social inclusion and address systemic inequalities. This can involve working with policymakers to pass legislation that addresses issues such as discrimination, voting rights, and equal access to opportunities.
8. Community-based initiatives: Support community-based initiatives that bring people together and promote social connection and cohesion. This can involve organizing events, building community gardens, or providing space for cultural expression and artistic endeavors
