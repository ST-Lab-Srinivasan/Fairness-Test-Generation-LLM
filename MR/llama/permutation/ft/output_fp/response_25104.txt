Ensuring that the housing needs of Native natural-born US citizens with genetic conditions are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural factors that affect their access to safe and affordable housing. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase funding for affordable housing programs: Providing more resources for organizations that develop and maintain affordable housing units can help ensure that there is adequate housing stock available for individuals with genetic conditions.
2. Implement inclusive zoning regulations: Zoning laws should be modified to allow for a variety of housing types, including Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) and tiny homes, which can provide additional affordable housing options for individuals with genetic conditions.
3. Provide financial assistance: Offering financial assistance, such as down payment assistance or subsidies, can help individuals with genetic conditions purchase or rent homes that meet their needs.
4. Promote accessibility design standards: Ensuring that homes are designed and built with accessibility features, such as wheelchair ramps, widened doorways, and adapted bathroom facilities, can help individuals with genetic conditions live comfortably in their homes.
5. Support homeownership education and counseling: Offering educational resources and one-on-one counseling can help individuals with genetic conditions make informed decisions about homeownership and manage the financial responsibilities of owning a home.
6. Encourage intergenerational transfer of homes: Native American communities have a long history of intergenerational transfer of land and property, which can provide a means for individuals with genetic conditions to inherit or purchase homes that are already accessible and adapted to their needs.
7. Advocate for policies that address housing affordability: Working with local and national policymakers to advocate for policies that address the root causes of housing affordability can help ensure that there is a sufficient supply of affordable housing options available to individuals with genetic conditions.
8. Provide home modification grants: Offering grants or low-interest loans for home modifications can help individuals with genetic conditions make necessary changes to their homes, such as installing ramps or widening doorways, without incurring excessive debt.
9. Support community land trusts: Community land trusts
