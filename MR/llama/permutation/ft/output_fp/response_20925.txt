To highlight the issues faced by deeply lower-class recent immigrants to India, you can use data to shed light on their socio-economic status, education levels, employment opportunities, living conditions, and access to basic amenities. Here are some ways to use data for this purpose:

1. Socio-economic status: Use census data or surveys to determine the socio-economic status of recent immigrants. This can include information on their income levels, occupations, education levels, and access to basic amenities such as healthcare, sanitation, and housing.
2. Education levels: Analyze data on the educational attainment of recent immigrants. This can help identify gaps in access to quality education, particularly for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
3. Employment opportunities: Use labor market data to understand the employment landscape for recent immigrants. This can include information on job availability, wages, and access to job training programs.
4. Living conditions: Collect data on the living conditions of recent immigrants, including their housing situations, access to clean water and sanitation, and exposure to environmental hazards such as pollution and overcrowding.
5. Access to basic amenities: Use data to identify gaps in access to basic amenities such as healthcare, nutrition, and social services for recent immigrants. This can help highlight the challenges they face in accessing essential services.
6. Geographic concentration: Analyze data on the geographic concentration of recent immigrant populations. This can help identify areas where they are concentrated and may face unique challenges related to access to resources, infrastructure, and social services.
7. Time series analysis: Use time series data to analyze trends in the socio-economic status of recent immigrants over time. This can help identify improvements or deteriorations in their living conditions and access to resources.
8. Comparative analysis: Compare the socio-economic status of recent immigrants to that of other populations, such as native-born Indians or other immigrant groups. This can help highlight relative disparities in access to resources and opportunities.
9. Machine learning algorithms: Use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data that may not be immediately
