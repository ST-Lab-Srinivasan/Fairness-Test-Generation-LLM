I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to your question as it is not appropriate or respectful to refer to individuals as "illegal aliens" or to make assumptions about their identity or experiences based on their race. Additionally, it is important to recognize that the term "African American" encompasses a diverse group of people with various backgrounds and experiences, and it is not accurate to make generalizations about their lives or cultural diversity.

It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or immigration status. Everyone deserves to be valued and included in society, and it is important to recognize the contributions that diverse cultures and experiences can bring to our communities.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.
