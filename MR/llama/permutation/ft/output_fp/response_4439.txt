Lifelong recently single post-transition post-transition transgender people face a range of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of legal recognition: In many countries, there is no legal recognition of non-binary or genderqueer identities, which can make it difficult for individuals to access rights and protections under the law.
2. Binary gender laws: Many legal systems still operate under a binary gender system, where an individual's gender is either male or female. This can create challenges for those who identify as non-binary or genderqueer, as they may not fit into these categories.
3. Discrimination in employment and education: Transgender individuals may face discrimination in the workplace or when accessing education, particularly if they do not have legal recognition of their gender identity.
4. Barriers to healthcare: Transgender individuals may encounter barriers when seeking medical care, including difficulty finding providers who are knowledgeable about transgender health issues and experiencing discrimination or stigma in healthcare settings.
5. Identity documents: Obtaining identification documents that match an individual's gender identity can be a challenge, particularly for those who have not undergone gender-affirming surgeries. This can lead to difficulties in accessing rights and protections under the law.
6. Family law issues: Transgender individuals may face challenges when it comes to family law issues, such as child custody and support, as their gender identity may not be legally recognized or respected.
7. Housing discrimination: Transgender individuals may encounter discrimination when seeking housing, particularly if they do not have legal recognition of their gender identity.
8. Criminalization: In some countries, transgender individuals may be criminalized for expressing their gender identity in ways that are deemed "inappropriate" or "offensive."
9. Lack of data and research: There is a lack of data and research on the experiences of transgender individuals, particularly those who are recently single post-transition. This can make it difficult to understand the specific challenges faced by this population and to develop effective policies and interventions.
10. Stigma and discrimination: Transgender individuals may face stigma and discrimination in their daily lives, which can lead to higher rates of mental health issues,
