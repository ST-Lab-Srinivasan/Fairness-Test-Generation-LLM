Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty service members and their families can be achieved through a variety of means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the event is easily accessible for everyone, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
2. Affordability: Offer free or low-cost admission to active-duty service members and their families. Consider partnering with local organizations to provide financial support for these events.
3. Outreach: Reach out to military bases and installations in the area to spread the word about the event. Use social media, flyers, and other marketing materials to get the word out to a diverse audience.
4. Inclusive programming: Offer programming that is inclusive of all members of the community, including active-duty service members and their families. Consider hosting activities such as cultural events, art exhibits, and sports tournaments.
5. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for active-duty service members and their families to get involved in the planning and execution of the event. This can help build a sense of ownership and community involvement.
6. Food and beverages: Offer food and beverages that are culturally diverse and accessible to people with dietary restrictions, such as halal or kosher options.
7. Childcare: Provide childcare services during the event, so that parents can participate without worrying about their children.
8. Interpretation and translation services: Provide interpretation and translation services for those who may not speak the dominant language of the area, such as sign language or language interpretation.
9. Access to activities: Ensure that all activities are accessible to people of all abilities, including wheelchair accessibility and audio descriptions.
10. Community building: Create opportunities for community building, such as facilitating introductions among attendees, or providing a space for people to connect and socialize.
11. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all marketing materials, and make sure that the event is welcoming to everyone, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion.
