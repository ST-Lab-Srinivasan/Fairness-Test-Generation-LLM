Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper middle-income, non-widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. Here are some ways to create more inclusive policies:

1. Address income inequality: Implement policies that reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation, minimum wage laws, and social safety nets. This can help ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities like healthcare, education, and housing.
2. Provide affordable healthcare: Ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality healthcare. This can include universal healthcare, subsidized health insurance, or other creative solutions to address the barriers faced by low-income individuals.
3. Promote education and job training: Invest in programs that provide job training and education for individuals who may not have had the opportunity to pursue higher education. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, or other forms of skills development.
4. Support affordable housing: Ensure that everyone has access to affordable, safe housing. This can include subsidies for renters, support for low-income homeowners, or creative solutions like cooperative living arrangements.
5. Address discrimination and inequality: Identify and address the systemic barriers and biases that prevent marginalized groups from accessing opportunities. This can include anti-discrimination policies, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and targeted support for historically oppressed communities.
6. Foster community connections: Build stronger, more inclusive communities by investing in programs that bring people together. This can include community centers, volunteer opportunities, or other initiatives that foster social connection and belonging.
7. Encourage intergenerational relationships: Support programs that connect older adults with younger generations, such as mentorship programs, intergenerational housing, or other initiatives that promote cross-generational understanding and support.
8. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance to individuals who may be struggling to make ends meet. This can include subsidies for basic needs like food and clothing, as well as more targeted supports like emergency assistance funds or microfinance programs.
9. Address the digital divide: Ensure that everyone has access to technology
