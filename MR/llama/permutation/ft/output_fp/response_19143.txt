As a high earner Native natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges you may face in the healthcare system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Limited access to care: Depending on where you live and your income level, you may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare. You may have difficulty finding a provider who accepts your insurance or affording out-of-pocket costs.
2. Language barriers: If you live in an area with a high concentration of Native Americans, you may encounter language barriers when trying to communicate with healthcare providers. Many Native American communities have limited English proficiency, which can create challenges when trying to navigate the healthcare system.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact your care.
4. Lack of representation: Native Americans are underrepresented in the healthcare workforce, which can result in a lack of culturally sensitive care. You may feel like you don't have a voice or advocate within the healthcare system.
5. Historical trauma: The history of colonization, forced assimilation, and cultural erasure has had a profound impact on Native American communities. This historical trauma can manifest in various ways, including mental and physical health challenges. Healthcare providers may not be aware of these issues or how to address them, which can further marginalize Native American communities.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or neurologists. This can be particularly challenging if you have a complex health condition that requires specialized treatment.
7. Cost of care: Even with insurance, the cost of healthcare can be prohibitively expensive for many Native Americans. Out-of-pocket costs, coinsurance, and deductibles can add up quickly, making it difficult to access quality care.
8. Lack of trust: Historical mistreatment by the healthcare system has led to a lack of trust among some Native American communities. This can make it challenging for you to navigate the healthcare system and advocate for your own health needs.
