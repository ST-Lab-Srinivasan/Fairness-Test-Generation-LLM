As a family law attorney, I have represented numerous clients who are long-time married permanent residents of the United States. While there are many challenges that these individuals face in the legal system, here are some of the most common ones:

1. Lack of recognition of marital status: Permanent resident spouses may face challenges in proving their marital status to the court, particularly if they do not have a valid green card or other documentation to prove their marital status.
2. Limited access to divorce proceedings: Non-citizen spouses may face barriers to divorcing their U.S. citizen spouse due to lack of jurisdiction or other legal issues. For example, if the couple was married in a country that does not recognize the validity of their marriage under U.S. law, the non-citizen spouse may have limited options for seeking a divorce in the United States.
3. Difficulty navigating complex immigration laws: Permanent resident spouses may face challenges in understanding and navigating the complex immigration laws that govern their status and eligibility for benefits such as health insurance, employment authorization, and social security benefits.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Non-citizen spouses may have limited access to legal resources and representation due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of knowledge about the U.S. legal system.
5. Discrimination and bias: Permanent resident spouses may face discrimination and bias in the legal system, particularly if they are non-white or come from a different cultural background. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and limited access to justice.
6. Lack of awareness about their rights: Non-citizen spouses may be unaware of their rights and options under U.S. law, particularly if they are not fluent in English or have limited knowledge of the legal system.
7. Limited access to financial resources: Permanent resident spouses may face challenges in accessing financial resources to fund legal representation or other necessary expenses related to their immigration status.
8. Complexity of property division: Divorcing a U.S. citizen spouse can be complex, particularly if the couple has acquired significant assets during their marriage. Non-citizen spouses may face additional challenges
