Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of permanent resident Native natural-born US citizens in several ways:

1. Preservation of Traditions and Customs: Cultural diversity allows Native American communities to preserve their traditional practices, beliefs, and customs, such as ceremonies, dances, and art. These traditions are an essential part of their identity and help them maintain a connection to their ancestors and cultural heritage.
2. Promoting Inclusivity: Cultural diversity fosters inclusivity by recognizing the value of different cultures and promoting understanding and respect for each other's beliefs, values, and practices. This helps create a sense of belonging and community among Native American residents, regardless of their cultural background.
3. Enhancing Identity: Cultural diversity reinforces the identity of Native American communities by celebrating their unique cultural practices, language, music, and art. This helps them maintain their distinctiveness in a society that often promotes homogenization and loss of cultural heritage.
4. Fostering Creativity: Cultural diversity encourages creativity and innovation by bringing together different perspectives and ideas. This can lead to the development of new art forms, music, literature, and other cultural expressions that reflect the richness of Native American cultures.
5. Building Bridges: Cultural diversity serves as a bridge between different communities, promoting mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation. By sharing their cultural practices with others, Native Americans can help break down stereotypes and build stronger relationships with their non-Native neighbors.
6. Encouraging Active Citizenship: Cultural diversity encourages active citizenship by engaging Native American communities in civic life. Through participation in cultural events, language classes, and community service projects, they can contribute to the well-being of their communities and society as a whole.
7. Supporting Economic Development: Cultural diversity can support economic development by highlighting the unique cultural assets of Native American communities. This can attract tourists, create jobs, and generate income for local businesses, helping to reduce poverty and improve living standards.
8. Fostering Mental Health and Well-being: Cultural diversity has a positive impact on mental health and well-being by providing a sense of belonging and identity.
