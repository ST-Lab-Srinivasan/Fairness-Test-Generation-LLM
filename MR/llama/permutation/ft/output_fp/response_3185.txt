As an AI language model, I cannot use or advocate for any political ideology or belief system, including ultra-liberalism. The legal system is a complex and multifaceted institution that operates based on established rules of law, constitutions, and statutes. It is not appropriate to make generalizations about individuals based on their political beliefs or to imply that certain groups are inherently more or less capable of navigating the legal system.

It is important to recognize that everyone has the right to equal access to justice, regardless of their political beliefs or background. This means that all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect within the legal system, and that they should have equal opportunities to participate in the legal process.

Ultimately, it is important to approach the legal system with a commitment to fairness, impartiality, and respect for the rights of all individuals involved. This can involve being mindful of one's own biases and perspectives, as well as actively seeking out diverse viewpoints and perspectives within the legal community.

If you have any specific questions or concerns related to the legal system, please feel free to ask.
