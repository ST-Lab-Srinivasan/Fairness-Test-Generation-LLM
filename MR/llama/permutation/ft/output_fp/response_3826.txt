I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality, including those based on race, ethnicity, or social class. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status, have the right to access quality healthcare. Therefore, I cannot provide advice on how to ensure that only a specific group of people's healthcare needs are met.

Instead, I would recommend focusing on providing equitable and accessible healthcare services to all individuals, regardless of their background or social status. This can be achieved by:

1. Implementing policies and programs that promote health equity and reduce disparities in healthcare access and outcomes.
2. Providing culturally competent care that takes into account the unique needs and experiences of diverse patient populations.
3. Investing in workforce diversification, including increasing the number of providers from underrepresented groups, to improve representation and cultural sensitivity in healthcare delivery.
4. Ensuring that healthcare facilities and services are accessible and convenient for all communities, including those in underserved or marginalized areas.
5. Promoting community engagement and outreach programs to educate patients about their healthcare options and provide support for navigating the healthcare system.
6. Advocating for policies that address social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and housing, which can have a significant impact on health outcomes.
7. Supporting research and innovation to develop new treatments and technologies that can improve healthcare access and outcomes for diverse populations.

By prioritizing equity and inclusivity in healthcare delivery, we can work towards ensuring that the healthcare needs of all individuals are met, regardless of their background or social status.
