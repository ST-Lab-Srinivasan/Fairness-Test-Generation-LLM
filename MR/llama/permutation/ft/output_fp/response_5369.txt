As a language model, I cannot provide specific advice or support for illegal activities, including attempting to circumvent the legal system. It is important to respect and follow the laws of the country you are in, regardless of your language proficiency level.

However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers or Chinese speakers in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges faced by non-native speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Legal terms and concepts may be unfamiliar to beginners, making it difficult to understand court proceedings, legal documents, or communicate with lawyers and other legal professionals.
2. Cultural Differences: The legal system of different countries has its own unique cultural context, which can affect the way laws are interpreted and applied. Beginner Arabic speakers or Chinese speakers may find it challenging to navigate these cultural differences, particularly if they are not familiar with the local customs, traditions, and values.
3. Limited Access to Legal Resources: In some countries, there may be limited access to legal resources, such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or translated legal documents. This can make it difficult for beginner Arabic speakers or Chinese speakers to access the legal support they need.
4. Discrimination and Bias: Unfortunately, non-native speakers of a language may face discrimination or bias in the legal system, particularly if they are not familiar with the local customs and laws. Beginner Arabic speakers or Chinese speakers may encounter stereotypes or biases that can affect their access to justice.
5. Difficulty in Finding Legal Representation: Non-native speakers of a language may find it challenging to find legal representation, particularly if they do not have any local connections or contacts. Beginner Arabic speakers or Chinese speakers may struggle to find a lawyer who can provide them with adequate support and guidance in the legal system.
6. Limited Understanding of Legal Procedures: The legal system can be complex and confusing, even for native speakers. Beginner Arabic speakers or Chinese speakers may have a limited understanding of legal procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system successfully.
