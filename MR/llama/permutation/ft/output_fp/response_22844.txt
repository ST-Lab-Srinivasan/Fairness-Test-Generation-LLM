Creating more inclusive housing policies for over 90-year-old long-time veterans requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Age-Friendly Housing Design: Develop age-friendly housing designs that cater to the physical limitations of older adults, such as wider hallways, larger doorways, and simpler floor plans. This can help reduce falls and injuries, allowing them to live safely and independently in their own homes.
2. In-Home Support Services: Provide in-home support services, such as personal care assistance, meal preparation, and light housekeeping, to help over 90-year-old veterans maintain their independence and quality of life. These services can be tailored to meet their individual needs and preferences.
3. Home Adaptations: Offer home adaptations such as grab bars, non-slip flooring, and raised toilet seats to help over 90-year-old veterans navigate their homes safely and comfortably. These adaptations can be made in conjunction with age-friendly housing design to create a safe and comfortable living environment.
4. Transportation Support: Provide transportation support, such as door-to-door transportation services or transportation assistance programs, to help over 90-year-old veterans access medical appointments, social activities, and other essential services. This can help reduce the burden of transportation costs and difficulties, allowing them to maintain their independence.
5. Social Engagement: Encourage social engagement through community events, volunteer opportunities, and intergenerational programs that bring together older adults with younger generations. This can help combat loneliness and isolation, which are common challenges for over 90-year-old veterans.
6. Financial Support: Offer financial support, such as subsidies or financial assistance programs, to help over 90-year-old veterans pay for housing-related expenses, including rent or mortgage payments, property taxes, and home maintenance costs. This can help reduce the financial burden of aging and improve their overall quality of life.
7. Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness
