Supporting the civic engagement of non-liberal immigrant recent immigrants in the US can be done through various means. Here are some strategies that have been shown to be effective:

1. Provide access to information and resources: Many immigrants may not be aware of their voting rights, registration processes, or the candidates running in local elections. Providing them with accurate and unbiased information can help increase their participation in the electoral process.
2. Offer language support: Many non-liberal immigrants may face barriers to civic engagement due to language barriers. Offering language support, such as interpreters or translated materials, can help remove these barriers.
3. Build trust and rapport: Building trust and rapport with immigrant communities can help them feel more comfortable participating in the electoral process. This can be done through community outreach and engagement efforts, such as hosting town hall meetings or cultural events.
4. Connect them to local leaders and organizations: Introducing immigrants to local leaders and organizations that share their values and interests can help them feel more connected to the community and motivated to participate in civic life.
