Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and interests of the target audience: It is essential to conduct research and gather input from the target audience to understand their needs, interests, and preferences. This can help tailor the cultural programs to meet their unique requirements.
2. Offer culturally relevant content: Develop cultural programs that are relevant to the experiences and interests of ethnically full African American learners. This can include exposure to authentic Chinese language materials, such as literature, music, and art, that reflect the culture and heritage of African Americans.
3. Use inclusive teaching methods: Train teachers to use culturally responsive teaching methods that promote equity and inclusion. This can involve using teaching strategies that are sensitive to the diverse backgrounds and experiences of students and fostering a classroom environment that is welcoming and respectful of all learners.
4. Provide opportunities for cultural exchange: Organize cultural events and activities that allow beginner Chinese speakers to interact with each other and share their experiences. This can help build a sense of community and promote cross-cultural understanding and respect.
5. Foster a supportive learning environment: Create a learning environment that is supportive and inclusive of all learners. This can involve providing opportunities for beginners to connect with more advanced learners, offering additional resources and support, and recognizing and celebrating the achievements of all students.
6. Address potential biases and stereotypes: Be aware of potential biases and stereotypes that may exist in the language learning classroom and actively work to challenge and overcome them. This can involve discussing and dismantling these biases, as well as promoting a more inclusive and equitable learning environment.
7. Engage with the broader community: Develop partnerships with local organizations and community groups that serve ethnically full African American populations. This can help create opportunities for cultural exchange and language learning outside of the classroom.
8. Provide flexible and accessible programming: Offer cultural programs that are flexible and accessible to a wide range of learners. This can involve offering online or hybrid courses, as well as providing additional resources and support for learners who
