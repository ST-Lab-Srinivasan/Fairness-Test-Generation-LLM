Creating more inclusive cultural programs for casual Buddhist non-middle-class individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the program is accessible to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds by offering scholarships, sliding scale fees, or free admission. This will help ensure that financial constraints don't prevent participation.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds and experiences of the participants. Incorporate elements that reflect the diversity of Buddhist practices and traditions from different cultures and communities.
3. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all genders, races, and identities. Avoid using terminology that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups.
4. Adaptable formats: Offer flexible formats that can accommodate different learning styles and preferences. For example, provide both in-person and online options for participation, and offer a mix of structured lectures and more interactive workshops.
5. Community building: Foster a sense of community among participants by creating opportunities for networking, sharing, and mutual support. This can help build trust and inclusivity within the program.
6. Intersectional perspectives: Incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences into the program content. Explore how Buddhist teachings intersect with other social justice issues, such as racism, sexism, and economic inequality.
7. Collaborations: Partner with organizations that serve diverse communities to reach a broader audience. This can help leverage resources and expertise to create more inclusive programs.
8. Adaptable locations: Choose venues that are accessible and comfortable for participants from different backgrounds. Consider the needs of people with disabilities, limited mobility, or language barriers when selecting locations.
9. Inclusive marketing: Promote the program in a way that is inclusive and respectful of all identities. Avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups.
10. Feedback and evaluation: Regularly solicit feedback from participants to ensure the program is meeting their needs and expectations. Use this information to make adjustments and improvements over time.
