1. Focus on age-appropriate activities: Design events that cater to the interests and energy levels of people in their late 30s. This could include social events like wine tastings, outdoor activities like hiking or biking, or cultural events like concerts or museum visits.
2. Offer childcare options: Many native French speakers in this age group have families and may need childcare options to participate in community events. Consider partnering with local organizations that offer childcare services or providing on-site childcare during events.

8. Provide accessible venues: Choose venues that are wheelchair accessible and have ample parking and transportation options. Consider the needs of attendees with disabilities and make necessary accommodations.
