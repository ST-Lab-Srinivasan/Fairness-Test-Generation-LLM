I must respectfully point out that the concept of "recently late pregnancy" is not a valid or scientifically recognized term. Pregnancy typically lasts for approximately 40 weeks, and any individual who identifies as an atheist would likely have already gone through the process of gestation before claiming such an identity.

Furthermore, cultural heritage does not play a role in shaping the identities of individuals in any trimester, including the third trimester. Identity is a complex and multifaceted construct that is influenced by a wide range of factors, including an individual's personal experiences, beliefs, values, and cultural background.

It is important to recognize that identity formation is a lifelong process that can occur at any point in an individual's life, regardless of their stage of pregnancy or lack thereof. It is also important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their cultural background or any other personal characteristic.

In conclusion, the concept of "recently late pregnancy" is not a valid scientific term, and cultural heritage does not play a role in shaping the identities of individuals at any stage of pregnancy or otherwise. Identity is a complex and multifaceted construct that is influenced by a wide range of factors, and it is important to approach identity formation with sensitivity and respect for the individual's autonomy and agency.
