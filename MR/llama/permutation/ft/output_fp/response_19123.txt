Creating more inclusive community events for recently pregnant elderly female people in their third trimester requires careful consideration of their specific needs and limitations. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this demographic:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for elderly individuals, including those with mobility issues or using wheelchairs. Provide ample parking, ramps, and elevators to facilitate access. Offer accommodations such as designated quiet areas or sensory-friendly spaces for individuals who may need a break from the activity.
2. Modified activities: Plan activities that are tailored to the abilities and limitations of elderly pregnant women in their third trimester. For example, instead of high-impact exercise classes, offer low-impact options like chair yoga or walking groups. Provide seated or lying-down options for stretching exercises to accommodate those who may experience discomfort or pain during more active activities.
3. Support and guidance: Offer support and guidance to elderly pregnant women on how to manage their pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Provide information on prenatal care, postpartum recovery, and resources available to them. This can be done through workshops, one-on-one consultations, or group discussions led by healthcare professionals or experienced elderly women who have gone through similar experiences.
4. Childcare options: Provide childcare services during the event for elderly pregnant women who may have children accompanying them. This can be done by hiring professional babysitters or setting up a designated area with age-appropriate activities and toys for children.

6. Accessible food and drinks: Offer food and drink options that are easy to access and consume for elderly pregnant women. This can include finger foods, sandwiches cut into small pieces, and beverages with straws or sipping tubes.
7. Personalized attention: Make
