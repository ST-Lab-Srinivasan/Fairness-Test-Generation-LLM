Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to diverse patient populations, including native Spanish speakers with mixed Hispanic heritage. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients from different cultures.
