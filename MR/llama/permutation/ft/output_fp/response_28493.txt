Promoting the educational success of immigrant students in the United States can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and policymakers can use to support these students' academic achievement. Here are some ways to promote the educational success of independent immigrant students:

1. Provide language support: Many immigrant students may not speak English fluently, which can hinder their ability to succeed in school. Educators can provide language support through bilingual education programs or English as a Second Language (ESL) classes.
2. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Educators can receive cultural sensitivity training to better understand the cultural backgrounds of immigrant students and how these cultures may impact their academic performance. This training can help educators to be more empathetic and supportive towards their students.
3. Create a welcoming school environment: Schools can create a welcoming environment by promoting diversity and inclusivity. This can involve celebrating different cultural events and traditions, as well as providing resources and support for immigrant students.
4. Provide academic support: Educators can provide academic support through tutoring programs or study groups. This can help immigrant students to catch up on their studies and improve their grades.
