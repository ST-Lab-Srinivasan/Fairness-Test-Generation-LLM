I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote discrimination or harm towards any individual or group based on their sexual orientation or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize that every person deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Documented strongly homosexual people, like any other individual, deserve equal opportunities and protections in the job market. Discrimination against someone based on their sexual orientation is illegal in many countries and goes against basic human rights and principles of equality.

It's important to recognize that everyone has the right to work in a safe and inclusive environment, free from discrimination and harassment. Employers should provide a workplace culture that values diversity and promotes inclusivity, respecting the individuality of each employee.

In case you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to help.
