As a multimillionaire immigrant to the US, I have observed that there are several challenges faced by non-wealthy immigrants in the healthcare system. Here are some of the key challenges:

1. Language barriers: Many recent immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties when trying to communicate with healthcare providers or navigate the healthcare system.
2. Lack of access to health insurance: Many immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented or have a visa that does not provide health insurance coverage, may struggle to access medical care due to financial constraints.
3. Limited cultural competency: The US healthcare system may not be equipped to handle the diverse cultural needs of immigrant populations, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications between providers and patients.
4. Discrimination and stigma: Immigrants may face discrimination or stigma due to their race, ethnicity, or immigration status, which can affect their ability to access healthcare services.
5. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The US healthcare system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. This can lead to difficulties in finding providers who speak their language or understand their cultural needs.
6. Limited availability of specialized care: Immigrants may have difficulty accessing specialized medical care, such as pediatrics or oncology, due to a lack of providers who are fluent in their native language or have experience working with patients from their culture.
7. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Many immigrants may face barriers when trying to access mental health services, such as depression or anxiety, due to cultural stigma or limited availability of providers who are fluent in their language.
8. Limited access to preventive care: Immigrants may have difficulty accessing preventive care, such as routine check-ups or vaccinations, due to financial constraints or limited availability of providers who speak their language.
9. Difficulty accessing emergency care: In some cases, immigrants may face barriers when trying to access emergency medical care, such as a heart attack or accident, due to language barriers or lack of insurance coverage.
