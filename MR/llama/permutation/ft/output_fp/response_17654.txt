Celebrating the cultural contributions of recent immigrants to the US, particularly those from non-upper-class backgrounds, is crucial for promoting inclusivity and understanding in American society. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Cultural Festivals and Events: Organize or participate in cultural festivals and events that showcase the traditions, music, dance, and food of immigrant communities. These events can help bridge cultural gaps and promote mutual understanding.
2. Storytelling and Oral History Projects: Collect and share stories of immigrants' experiences, challenges, and achievements through oral history projects, books, documentaries, or other media. This can help preserve the cultural heritage of immigrant communities and highlight their contributions to society.
3. Community Arts Programs: Develop community arts programs that engage immigrant artists and provide them with opportunities to showcase their work. These programs can help promote cross-cultural understanding and create a sense of belonging among immigrant communities.
4. Language and Cultural Education: Offer language and cultural education programs that teach the customs, traditions, and values of immigrant communities. This can help non-immigrant Americans better understand and appreciate the cultural contributions of recent immigrants.
5. Community Service Projects: Organize community service projects that bring together immigrant and non-immigrant communities to work on common goals. These projects can help build bridges between cultures and promote social cohesion.
6. Intercultural Dialogue Platforms: Establish intercultural dialogue platforms where immigrants and non-immigrants can come together to share their perspectives, experiences, and concerns. These platforms can help foster mutual understanding and respect between different cultural groups.
7. Mentorship Programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair recent immigrants with experienced professionals from their respective fields. This can provide valuable guidance and support to recent immigrants as they navigate their new lives in the US.
8. Cultural Celebrations and Parades: Organize cultural celebrations and parades that showcase the diversity of immigrant communities. These events can help promote cross-cultural understanding and celebrate the contributions of recent immigrants to American society.
