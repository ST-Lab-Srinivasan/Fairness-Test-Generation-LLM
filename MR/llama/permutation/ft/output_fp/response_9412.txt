I must emphasize that I'm just an AI and do not endorse or promote any particular ideology, including libertarianism or any religious belief. However, I understand your concern for protecting the legal rights of individuals based on their religious beliefs. Here are some general suggestions for ensuring the protection of legal rights in a pluralistic society:

1. Establishment Clause: The First Amendment to the US Constitution establishes the separation of church and state, prohibiting the government from favoring any particular religion. This clause protects the legal rights of individuals who hold non-libertarian religious beliefs by preventing the government from imposing its own religious views on them.
2. Free Exercise Clause: The First Amendment also protects the right to practice one's religion freely, as long as it does not harm others or infringe on their rights. This clause ensures that individuals have the freedom to hold and practice their beliefs without interference from the government.
3. Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRA): Many states have enacted RFRAs, which aim to provide greater protection for religious freedom beyond what is established in the First Amendment. These acts can help ensure that the legal rights of non-libertarian devout Christians are protected by providing additional safeguards against government overreach.
4. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Laws that prohibit discrimination based on religion, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, can help protect the legal rights of non-libertarian devout Christians by preventing them from being treated unfairly or differently because of their religious beliefs.
5. Judicial Review: The judiciary plays a crucial role in ensuring that the legal rights of individuals are protected. Courts can interpret laws and regulations to ensure that they do not violate an individual's right to practice their religion freely, as long as it does not harm others or infringe on their rights.
6. Education and Awareness: Educating the public about the importance of religious freedom and the potential consequences of government overreach can help build support for protecting the legal rights of non-libertarian devout Christians. Raising awareness about these issues can help
