As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that the term "soft libertarian" is a subjective and context-dependent label, and its meaning can vary depending on the individual or group using it. However, in general, a soft libertarian is someone who supports limited government intervention in personal and economic matters but still values social welfare and equality.

The impacts of immigration status on middle-class soft libertarians can be complex and multifaceted. Here are some potential effects:

1. Empathy and compassion: Many middle-class soft libertarians may feel empathy and compassion for undocumented immigrants, particularly if they are fleeing violence, poverty, or persecution in their home countries. They may support policies that provide a pathway to citizenship or temporary residency for these individuals.
2. Economic concerns: Soft libertarians may worry about the economic impact of immigration on middle-class workers. They may argue that increased competition from immigrants could lead to job displacement and downward pressure on wages. However, they may also recognize that immigrants can bring new skills, ideas, and innovation to the economy, which could lead to growth and prosperity.
3. Social welfare: Soft libertarians often prioritize social welfare and equality. They may support policies that provide resources and services to undocumented immigrants, such as healthcare, education, and legal aid. They may also advocate for policies that address the root causes of poverty and inequality, such as lack of access to education and job opportunities.
4. Personal freedoms: Soft libertarians tend to value personal freedoms and autonomy. They may argue that immigrants should have the right to live and work in a country without undue interference from the government. They may support policies that protect the privacy and civil liberties of immigrants, such as the right to practice their religion or speak their native language.
5. Human rights: Soft libertarians often prioritize human rights and dignity. They may argue that all individuals have the right to seek asylum from persecution or violence, regardless of their immigration status. They may support policies that protect the rights of undocumented immigrants
