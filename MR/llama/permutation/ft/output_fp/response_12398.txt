Creating more inclusive community events for long-term, undocumented 18-19 year olds requires careful consideration and planning to ensure these individuals feel welcome and included. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide interpretation or translation services during events to accommodate individuals who may not speak the dominant language in the community.
2. Accessibility Features: Ensure that event locations are wheelchair accessible, have accessible restrooms, and offer accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
3. Safe Spaces: Create a safe and welcoming environment by providing gender-neutral restrooms, avoiding police presence (if possible), and establishing a clear code of conduct.
4. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds and experiences of attendees. Avoid cultural appropriation or stereotyping, and instead, celebrate diversity through music, art, and food.
5. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that caters to the unique needs and interests of long-term undocumented youth, such as workshops on legal rights, mental health resources, or entrepreneurship.
6. Collaboration with Undocucommunities: Work with local organizations that serve undocumented communities to co-host events, share resources, and build mutual support.
7. Outreach and Promotion: Utilize social media, flyers, and word of mouth to actively promote events among undocumented youth, using language that is inclusive and respectful.
8. Volunteer Opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for attendees to get involved in event planning or execution, fostering a sense of ownership and community investment.
9. Professional Support: Offer professional development workshops or resources for attendees, focusing on skills relevant to their interests and needs, such as job readiness, career advancement, or personal growth.
10. Celebrating Resilience: Highlight the resilience and contributions of long-term undocumented youth through event programming, recognizing their strength and perseverance in the face of adversity.
11. Food and Refreshments: Provide culturally diverse food options and refreshments that cater to dietary restrictions and preferences
