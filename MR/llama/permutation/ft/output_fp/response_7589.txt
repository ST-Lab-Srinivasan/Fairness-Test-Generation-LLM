Ensuring the housing needs of documented very old (90s+) individuals can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some recommendations:

1. Accessible Housing Options: Develop and preserve affordable, accessible housing options that cater to the unique needs of older adults. This could include homes with wheelchair ramps, widened doorways, and easier-to-use kitchen appliances.
2. Age-Friendly Communities: Encourage the development of age-friendly communities that provide a range of housing options, including multigenerational homes, cooperatives, and senior-only complexes. These communities should also have access to amenities like parks, transportation, and social activities.

4. Supportive Housing Programs: Develop supportive housing programs that provide on-site support services, such as meal delivery, transportation, and social activities, to help very old individuals maintain their independence and quality of life.
5. Housing Counseling: Offer housing counseling services specifically tailored to the needs of very old individuals. This could include assistance with finding affordable housing options, navigating the application process, and accessing financial resources.
6. Public Transportation: Ensure that public transportation options are accessible and convenient for older adults, including wheelchair-accessible buses and trains, and fare discounts or subsidies for seniors.
7. Affordable Housing Options: Develop and preserve affordable housing options, such as rent control or subsidized rent, to ensure that very old individuals can afford to live in safe and decent housing.
8. Intergenerational Living: Encourage intergenerational living arrangements, where older adults can live with their families or other younger generations, providing emotional and practical support to one another.
9. Technology Assistance: Provide technology assistance, such as smart home devices, to help very old individuals maintain their independence and quality of life.
