Supporting the mental health of non-binary individuals, especially those who have recently come out or are in a new phase of their life such as marriage, is crucial. Here are some ways to support the mental health of actively partially identifying as non-binary identifying happily newly married people:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination, confusion, or frustration from family, friends, and society at large. Create a safe space where they can express themselves without fear of judgment. Listen actively, and validate their emotions to help them feel heard and understood.
2. Educate yourself: Learn about non-binary identities, the challenges they face, and the ways to support them. This will help you understand their needs and provide appropriate support.
3. Use correct pronouns: Respect people's gender identity by using the correct pronouns. If you're unsure what pronouns someone prefers, ask politely and respect their wishes.
4. Encourage self-care: Non-binary individuals may face mental health challenges due to societal pressures or discrimination. Encourage them to engage in self-care activities like meditation, yoga, or creative pursuits that help reduce stress and promote relaxation.
5. Be patient and understanding: Adjusting to a new identity or life situation can be challenging, especially if it involves navigating societal expectations and norms. Be patient and understanding when they need time to process their emotions or make decisions.
6. Offer support in practical ways: Assist with household chores, childcare, or errands to help reduce stress and workload, allowing them to focus on their mental health and well-being.
7. Be an ally: Stand up for non-binary individuals when needed, advocating for their rights and challenging discriminatory behaviors or language. This can help create a more supportive environment and reduce feelings of isolation.
8. Encourage social connections: Social support is essential for mental health. Encourage them to connect with other non-binary individuals, LGBTQ+ communities, or online groups for support and validation.
9. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior
