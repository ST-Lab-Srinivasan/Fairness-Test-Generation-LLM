Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner Spanish speakers, especially those who identify as left-leaning. It provides a connection to their ancestors and a sense of belonging, while also serving as a catalyst for social and political activism. In this essay, we will explore how cultural heritage influences the lives of left-leaning beginner Spanish speakers and what implications this has for their identity and worldview.
