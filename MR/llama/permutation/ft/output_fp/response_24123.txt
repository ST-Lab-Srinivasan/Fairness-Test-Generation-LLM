I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any racial or ethnic group. It is important to recognize that each individual has their own unique experiences and challenges, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Additionally, it is not productive or respectful to label individuals or groups as "extreme ultra-liberal" or "ethnically full."

It is important to recognize that the healthcare system can be complex and challenging for many people, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Factors such as access to care, cultural competency, and social determinants of health can all impact an individual's experience with the healthcare system. It is important to approach these issues with empathy and respect, rather than making assumptions or generalizations based on racial or ethnic stereotypes.

If you have any specific questions or concerns about the healthcare system, I would be happy to help address them in a respectful and unbiased manner.
