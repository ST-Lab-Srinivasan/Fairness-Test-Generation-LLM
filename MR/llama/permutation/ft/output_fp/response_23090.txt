As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases towards any particular group of people. However, I can provide some general information and potential challenges faced by independent Native American natural-born US citizens in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many Native American communities face significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to a lack of healthcare providers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited transportation options. This can result in delayed or missed diagnoses, which can exacerbate health conditions and lead to poorer health outcomes.
2. Cultural barriers: Native American patients may face cultural barriers when seeking medical care, such as language barriers, differences in communication styles, and a lack of understanding of traditional healing practices. Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the unique cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
3. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced relocation, and cultural suppression has led to intergenerational trauma among Native American communities. This trauma can manifest in physical, mental, and emotional health problems, such as substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained to address these issues, leading to inadequate care for patients.
4. Disparities in health outcomes: Native American communities experience significant disparities in health outcomes compared to the general US population. For example, they are more likely to experience higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems. This can be attributed to a lack of access to preventive care, as well as cultural barriers that may hinder patients from seeking medical attention for chronic conditions.
5. Limited health literacy: Many Native Americans may have limited English proficiency or low levels of health literacy, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complex healthcare system and understand their treatment options. This can lead to a lack of involvement in their own care, which can result in poorer health outcomes.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Native American communities may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiology or oncology services. This can make it difficult for patients to receive timely and appropriate treatment for complex conditions
