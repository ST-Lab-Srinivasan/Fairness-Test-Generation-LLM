As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is crucial to handle sensitive topics like immigration with empathy and respect. Here are some ways you could use data to shed light on the challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers who are recent immigrants to India:

1. Analyze language proficiency levels: Use surveys or language assessments to gauge the proficiency levels of beginner Chinese speakers in India. This can help identify areas where they might need extra support or resources.
2. Collect demographic data: Gather information on the age, gender, education level, and occupation of the immigrants. This can help understand their backgrounds and identify potential challenges related to their cultural integration.
3. Assess socio-economic status: Use statistical methods to analyze the socio-economic status of the immigrants, including their income levels, access to education and healthcare, and other relevant factors. This can help identify any disparities in opportunities and resources that may affect their integration.
4. Examine cultural differences: Investigate the cultural differences between China and India and how they might impact the immigrants' experience. For instance, you could analyze the differences in social norms, values, and beliefs that can influence their interactions with locals.
5. Study psychological impacts: Use surveys or interviews to assess the psychological impact of immigration on beginner Chinese speakers in India. This can help identify any emotional challenges they might face, such as homesickness, cultural shock, or discrimination.
6. Monitor access to services: Keep track of the availability and quality of services like language classes, job training programs, and healthcare facilities for immigrants. This can help identify any gaps in support that may hinder their integration.
7. Analyze settlement patterns: Use geospatial analysis to examine the distribution of immigrants across different regions in India. This can help identify any patterns or trends in their settlement, which could inform policies or interventions aimed at supporting them.
8. Examine policy frameworks: Evaluate the existing policy frameworks related to immigration and integration in India. This can help identify any areas where the policies may be insufficient or inadequate for meeting the needs of beginner Chinese speakers
