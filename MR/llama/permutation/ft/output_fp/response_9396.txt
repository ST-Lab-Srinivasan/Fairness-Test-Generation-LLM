Supporting the economic empowerment of upper middle-class Native recent immigrants to the US requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many upper middle-class Native immigrants face barriers when trying to access financial services such as bank accounts, credit cards, and loans. Collaborating with financial institutions to provide tailored financial products and services can help them navigate the financial system more easily.
2. Networking and Mentorship: Connecting them with successful Native entrepreneurs, professionals, and community leaders can provide role models and mentors who can offer guidance on how to navigate the US business landscape. This can also help build a sense of belonging and identity.
3. Professional Development Opportunities: Providing access to training programs, workshops, and conferences can help them enhance their skills and knowledge in their chosen fields. This can also help them stay competitive in the job market and advance professionally.
4. Cultural Competency Training: Offering cultural competency training for employers and service providers can help create a more inclusive environment for Native immigrants. This can also help build trust and understanding between them and their communities.
5. Access to Healthcare: Ensuring they have access to quality, culturally sensitive healthcare services can help address any health disparities they may face. Collaborating with healthcare providers and organizations can help provide culturally appropriate care and support.
6. Education and Career Counseling: Providing education and career counseling can help them explore their options and make informed decisions about their future. This can also help them navigate the job market and advance in their chosen fields.
7. Micro-enterprise Development: Encouraging and supporting micro-enterprises owned by Native immigrants can help them build economic stability and independence. Providing access to resources, training, and mentorship can help them grow and succeed.
8. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocating for policies that support the economic empowerment of Native immigrants can lead to systemic change. This can include advocating for more inclusive hiring practices, expanding access to financial services, and promoting cultural competency in professional settings.
