I must clarify that the term "extreme soft libertarian" is not a widely recognized or accepted political ideology, and it is possible that there may be cultural or contextual factors that could affect how well these strategies would work in practice. However, here are some general strategies that could be effective in supporting marginalized or underprivileged communities:

1. Empowerment through education: Providing access to quality education can help individuals and communities build the skills and knowledge they need to advocate for their rights and assert their autonomy. This could involve setting up schools, training programs, or partnering with existing educational institutions to provide support.
2. Economic empowerment: Poverty and economic inequality are significant challenges facing many marginalized communities. Strategies to address this could include providing access to financial services, promoting entrepreneurship and small business development, and advocating for policies that promote economic inclusion.
3. Community organizing and mobilization: Building a strong, organized community can help individuals and groups mobilize and advocate for their rights more effectively. This could involve facilitating communication and coordination among members, providing training and resources for community leaders, and supporting grassroots campaigns and initiatives.
4. Advocacy and activism: Working with local and national organizations to promote policies and practices that support marginalized communities can be an effective way to bring about change. This could involve advocating for policy reforms, participating in legal challenges, or engaging in public awareness campaigns.
5. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Many marginalized communities have rich cultural heritages that are at risk of being lost or erased. Strategies to preserve and revitalize these cultures could involve supporting cultural expression and innovation, documenting and archiving cultural practices and traditions, and advocating for the recognition and protection of cultural rights.
6. Mental health and wellness: Marginalized communities are often disproportionately affected by mental health issues due to systemic stressors such as discrimination, trauma, and marginalization. Strategies to support mental health and wellness could involve providing access to mental health services, promoting self-care and stress management techniques, and advocating for policies that address the root causes of mental health issues.
