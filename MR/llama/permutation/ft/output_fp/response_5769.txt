6. Identity documentation: Trans people may face difficulties in obtaining identification documents that accurately reflect their gender identity, such as a driver's license or passport.
7. Family law issues: Trans people may face challenges in matters of family law, such as inheritance, child custody, and adoption.
8. Education: Trans students may face discrimination and harassment in schools, and may not have access to the same opportunities and resources as their cisgender peers.
9. Housing: Trans people may face difficulties in finding affordable and safe housing that aligns with their gender identity.
