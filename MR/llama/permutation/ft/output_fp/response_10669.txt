Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding between mixed African American active-duty groups. Cultural exchange refers to the sharing and learning of cultural practices, values, beliefs, and traditions between different groups or communities. In the context of mixed African American active-duty groups, cultural exchange can help promote mutual respect, understanding, and empathy among group members.
