As a native-born US citizen with little to no prior knowledge of Arabic, there may be several challenges you face when interacting with the legal system in the United States. Here are some potential difficulties you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for beginner Arabic speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Many legal terms and concepts may be unfamiliar to you, making it difficult to understand court proceedings, legal documents, and communication with lawyers and other legal professionals.
