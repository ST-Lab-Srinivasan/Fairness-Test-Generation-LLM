To highlight the issues faced by low-income and marginalized groups in Mexico, including not high-income professional individuals, we can use various types of data. Here are some examples:

1. Economic data: Use data on income inequality to demonstrate the gap between the rich and poor in Mexico. For example, according to a report by the World Bank, the richest 10% of the population in Mexico holds 37.6% of the country's wealth, while the poorest 50% hold only 9.8%.
2. Education data: Show the disparities in access to education between different socioeconomic groups in Mexico. According to UNESCO, the literacy rate for individuals aged 15 and over in Mexico is 93.7%, but there are significant differences in literacy rates across states, with some states having literacy rates as low as 70%.
3. Health data: Highlight the health disparities faced by marginalized communities in Mexico. For example, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), indigenous communities in Mexico have higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension than non-indigenous populations.
4. Labor data: Use data on employment and labor conditions to illustrate the challenges faced by low-income workers in Mexico. For example, according to a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO), 60% of workers in Mexico are in informal employment, which often lacks job security, social protection, and other rights.
5. Housing data: Show the disparities in access to adequate housing between different socioeconomic groups in Mexico. According to a report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 40% of households in Mexico lack access to basic services such as water, sanitation, and electricity.
6. Crime data: Highlight the issue of crime and security in marginalized communities in Mexico. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), crime rates are higher in areas with lower socioeconomic status, with 70% of crimes occurring in poor neighborhoods.
7. Political data: Use data on political participation and representation to illustrate the marginalization of certain groups in Mexico. For example
