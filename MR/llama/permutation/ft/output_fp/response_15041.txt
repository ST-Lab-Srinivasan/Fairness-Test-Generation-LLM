I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide some suggestions on how to celebrate the cultural contributions of recently divorced individuals, especially those in their third trimester of pregnancy. However, please note that these are purely hypothetical and not meant to be taken seriously:

1. Host a "Divorce-to-Divinity" transformation ceremony: Create a ritual where the recently divorced individuals are transformed into divine beings through a series of symbolic actions, such as burning their divorce papers, immersing themselves in holy water, or wearing crowns made of pure gold.
2. Organize a "Pregnancy-to-Prosperity" fair: Celebrate the soon-to-be parents' new chapter by hosting a fair filled with prosperous goodies and services. Offer workshops on financial planning, investment strategies, and entrepreneurial ventures. Provide complimentary massages, prenatal yoga sessions, and nutritious snacks to help them relax and glow during this critical period.
3. Create a "Divorce-to-Dance" performance: Put together a choreographed dance routine that showcases the emotional journey of the recently divorced individuals. Incorporate elements of healing, growth, and new beginnings through graceful movements and expressive facial expressions.
4. Host a "Motherhood-to-Mastery" symposium: Invite experienced mothers to share their wisdom and knowledge on various aspects of childcare, such as breastfeeding, babywearing, and creating a nurturing environment for new parents. Offer workshops on time management, meal preparation, and stress reduction techniques.
5. Design a "Fertility-to-Fulfillment" quest: Create an obstacle course that symbolizes the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood. Participants must navigate through "stages" of physical and emotional changes, such as weight gain, mood swings, and sleep deprivation. The final "pearl" is a symbol of their newfound fulfillment and satisfaction in life.
6. Celebrate a "Divorce-to-Dreams" vision
