Addressing the needs of non-traditional families, including those who are not long-time married or have diverse cultural backgrounds, is essential in disaster response. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Inclusive Communication: Develop communication strategies that cater to diverse language and cultural needs. Provide interpreters and translators for non-English speakers, and use visual aids and simplified language for those with limited literacy skills.
2. Flexible Housing Options: Offer flexible housing options that accommodate different family structures, such as single-parent households, blended families, or LGBTQ+ individuals. Provide temporary shelters or hotels that are inclusive and welcoming to all.
3. Gender-Sensitive Services: Ensure that disaster response services are gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate. For example, provide separate spaces for women and children in shelters, and offer gender-neutral hygiene products.
4. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities to understand their specific needs and concerns. Develop outreach strategies that cater to diverse cultural practices and values.
5. Inclusive Distribution of Aid: Ensure that aid distributions are carried out in an inclusive manner, taking into account the diverse needs of affected populations. Provide aid items that cater to different cultural and dietary preferences, such as halal or kosher food options.
6. Training and Capacity Building: Offer training programs for disaster response workers that include cultural competency modules. This will help workers understand the diverse needs of affected populations and provide more effective support.
7. Collaboration with Community Leaders: Partner with community leaders from diverse backgrounds to help identify specific needs and develop culturally appropriate response strategies.
8. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive, involving representatives from diverse communities and organizations. This will help ensure that the voices of all affected populations are heard and addressed.
9. Awareness and Education Campaigns: Develop awareness and education campaigns that cater to the diverse cultural practices and beliefs of affected populations. Provide information on disaster preparedness, response, and recovery in a culturally sensitive manner.
