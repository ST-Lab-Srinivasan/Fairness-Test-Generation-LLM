Not being disabled does not exempt individuals from facing challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by able-bodied individuals in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of representation and voice: Disabled individuals are often marginalized and underrepresented in the healthcare system, which can result in a lack of understanding and attention to their specific needs and concerns. Able-bodied individuals may feel unheard or overlooked in the healthcare system, leading to feelings of frustration and disempowerment.
2. Limited access to healthcare providers: Able-bodied individuals may face challenges accessing healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about their specific needs and concerns. This can result from a lack of trained healthcare professionals or limited availability of specialized care.
3. Lack of culturally competent care: The healthcare system often neglects the cultural and social needs of able-bodied individuals, leading to a lack of culturally competent care. This can result in misunderstandings and misdiagnoses, further marginalizing able-bodied individuals.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Able-bodied individuals may face stigma and discrimination within the healthcare system, particularly if they are seen as "healthy" or "normal." This can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment, which can hinder their ability to access care.
5. Limited focus on preventative care: The healthcare system often prioritizes treating illnesses and injuries over promoting preventative care for able-bodied individuals. This can result in a lack of attention to preventative measures such as regular check-ups, screenings, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
6. Limited advocacy and support: Able-bodied individuals may face challenges advocating for their needs within the healthcare system, particularly if they are not familiar with the language or processes involved. This can result in feelings of isolation and powerlessness.
7. Lack of education and resources: The healthcare system often neglects providing education and resources to able-bodied individuals on how to maintain their health and well-being. This can result in a lack of knowledge about healthy habits
