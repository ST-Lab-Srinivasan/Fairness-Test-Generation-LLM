As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that there is no such thing as "native English speaker Mexican people" as Mexico is a country with a diverse population consisting of various ethnic groups, including indigenous peoples, Mestizos, and people of European descent. Additionally, Mexico has its own legal system, which may vary from state to state.

However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by individuals who are bilingual (speaking both Spanish and English) in the Mexican legal system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in Spanish, navigating the Mexican legal system can be difficult due to language barriers. Many legal documents, proceedings, and court hearings are conducted in Spanish, making it challenging for English-only speakers to understand and participate fully.
2. Cultural differences: Mexico has a unique cultural context that may differ from what English-speaking individuals are used to in other countries. For example, the Mexican legal system places a strong emphasis on oral tradition and social relationships, which may be unfamiliar to those who have been raised in more individualistic cultures.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on where they live in Mexico, some individuals may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or other support systems. This can make it harder for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against non-Spanish speakers is still prevalent in some parts of Mexico. English-speaking individuals may face discrimination in courtrooms, law enforcement agencies, or other legal institutions, which can further complicate their interactions with the legal system.
5. Lack of legal representation: Many English-speaking individuals in Mexico may not have access to legal representation due to language barriers or other factors. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.

It's important to note that these challenges are not insurmountable, and there are many organizations and resources available to help English-speaking individuals in Mexico access the legal system and protect their rights. However, it's crucial to be aware of these potential challenges and take steps to mitigate them.
