Types of Genetic Conditions:
There are several types of genetic conditions that affect Native American or recent immigrant elderly male individuals in the United States. Some of the most common include:

2. Heart Disease: Elderly male Native Americans are at a higher risk of developing heart disease due to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and poor diet.
3. Cancer: Genetic mutations can increase the risk of cancer in elderly male Native Americans, particularly for types of cancer that are common among indigenous populations, such as lung, breast, and colon cancer.
4. Mental Health: Elderly male Native Americans may face increased risk of mental health challenges due to historical trauma, cultural loss, and social isolation.
5. Neurological Disorders: Genetic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders are more common among elderly male Native Americans than in the general population.
