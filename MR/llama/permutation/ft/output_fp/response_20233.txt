As a beginner French speaker and a native Arabic speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in France. Here are some of the common difficulties you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge for many non-native speakers is the language barrier. French is the official language of France, and legal terminology can be complex and difficult to understand for those who are not fluent in the language. This can make it hard to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals.
