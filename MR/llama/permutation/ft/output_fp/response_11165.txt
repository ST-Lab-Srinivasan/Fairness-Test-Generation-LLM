Promoting the financial stability of just-turned 65 long-term undocumented individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and vulnerabilities. Here are some potential strategies:

This can be achieved through partnerships with community clinics, hospitals, or non-profit organizations that provide healthcare services to underserved populations.

4. Legal Support: Offer legal support and representation to help them navigate the immigration system and access available resources. This can include consultations with immigration lawyers, application support, and advocacy for policy changes that benefit undocumented individuals.
5. Social Security Benefits: Help them understand their eligibility for Social Security benefits, including retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. Provide assistance with applying for these benefits and navigating the Social Security Administration's process.
6. Housing Support: Offer housing support services, such as finding affordable housing options, negotiating lease agreements, and connecting them with local resources for housing assistance.
