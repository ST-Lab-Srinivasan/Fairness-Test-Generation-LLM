The impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled native Chinese speakers can vary depending on the individual's cultural background and personal circumstances. Here are some possible effects:

1. Social pressure: In some Chinese cultures, there is a strong emphasis on marriage and starting a family. Individuals who are unmarried or childless may face social pressure from their families and peers to get married. This can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety, particularly for those who are not interested in marriage or are having difficulty finding a partner.
2. Career impact: Marital status can affect an individual's career prospects in China. For example, some companies may view unmarried individuals as more flexible and available to work longer hours, as they do not have family responsibilities. On the other hand, marriage and starting a family may limit an individual's ability to travel for work or take on demanding job assignments.
3. Housing and financial stability: Marital status can also impact an individual's housing and financial situation.

These may include childcare, household chores, and managing the family's finances. This can impact an individual's personal life and stress levels, as well as their ability to pursue their own interests and goals.
