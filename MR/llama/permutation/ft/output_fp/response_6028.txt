I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about people based on their immigration status. Everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that diversity and inclusivity are valuable assets to any community, and that everyone deserves to be valued and appreciated for who they are.

It is not appropriate to make judgments about someone's character or worth based on their immigration status. Rather, it is important to treat everyone with kindness, respect, and dignity. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and compassionate society where everyone feels valued and appreciated.

I hope this helps clarify things. Is there anything else I can help with?
