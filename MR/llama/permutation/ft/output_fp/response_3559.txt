Ensuring that the educational needs of all students, including those from marginalized groups such as cisgender non-upper-class students, are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses systemic barriers and biases within the education system. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training for teachers on culturally responsive teaching practices that recognize and value diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This can help create a more inclusive learning environment for all students.
2. Inclusive curriculum design: Develop curricula that are inclusive of diverse perspectives and experiences, and that actively challenge dominant narratives and power structures. This can involve incorporating marginalized voices and histories into the curriculum, as well as critically examining the cultural, social, and political contexts in which knowledge is produced and transmitted.
3. Identity-based pedagogy: Use pedagogical approaches that center the identities and experiences of marginalized groups, such as critical race theory, feminist theory, queer theory, and disability studies. This can help students from these groups feel seen, heard, and valued within the educational setting.
4. Community engagement: Build partnerships with community organizations and stakeholders that reflect the diversity of the student population. This can involve collaborating with local cultural centers, advocacy groups, and social service agencies to provide students with opportunities for experiential learning, mentorship, and community service.
5. Student-centered assessment: Develop assessment practices that prioritize student voice and agency, such as project-based assessments, peer review, and self-assessment. This can help students from marginalized groups feel more comfortable and confident in their academic abilities, and better equipped to navigate the educational system.
6. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship and support programs that connect students with peers and mentors who share similar experiences and backgrounds. This can help students from marginalized groups feel more connected and supported within the educational setting.
7. Safe space creation: Create physical and virtual safe spaces for students to express themselves without fear of judgment or reprisal. This can involve designating specific areas within schools as safe zones, as well
