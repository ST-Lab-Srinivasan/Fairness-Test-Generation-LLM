In addition to the challenges faced by low-income individuals, permanent residents in a country may also face various difficulties when accessing and affording healthcare. Some of these challenges include:

1. Cost: Even for those above the poverty line, out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare can be high, especially for expensive treatments or procedures. This can lead to financial strain and difficulty affording necessary care.
2. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on where they live, permanent residents may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as in the case of rural areas with few medical facilities or specialists.
3. Language barriers: Permanent residents who are not fluent in the local language may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers and understanding their diagnosis and treatment options.
4. Cultural barriers: Different cultural backgrounds and beliefs can lead to differences in healthcare preferences and practices, which can create challenges for healthcare providers to address.
5. Limited health literacy: Permanent residents may have limited knowledge about their health and the healthcare system, making it difficult for them to navigate the system effectively.
6. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or immigration status can still be prevalent in some parts of the world, leading to unequal access to healthcare for certain groups of people.
7. Documentation issues: Permanent residents may face difficulties providing proof of their residency or citizenship, which can create barriers to accessing healthcare services.
8. Transportation challenges: Depending on where they live, permanent residents may have limited access to transportation, making it difficult for them to reach medical facilities or appointments.
9. Limited social support: Permanent residents who are estranged from their families or communities may face difficulties navigating the healthcare system and accessing necessary care.
10. Stigma associated with seeking healthcare: Some permanent residents may face stigma or discrimination when seeking medical care, which can lead to delays in seeking necessary treatment or avoiding care altogether.

By understanding these challenges, healthcare providers can better serve the needs of permanent residents and work towards addressing the systemic issues that limit their access to quality care.
