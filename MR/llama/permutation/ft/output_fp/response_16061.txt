Creating more inclusive community events for recently genderqueer people, or those who are still exploring their gender identity, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your event more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness about gender identity and the experiences of genderqueer individuals. This can include workshops, presentations, or panels featuring genderqueer speakers.
2. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e. "men" or "women") and instead use gender-neutral terms like "people," "individuals," or "everyone."
3. Gender-Neutral Facilities: Ensure that your event facilities are gender-neutral, including restrooms and changing areas. Provide private, clean, and safe spaces for people of all genders to use.
4. Consent and Respect: Obtain informed consent from participants before engaging in any activities or events that may make them uncomfortable. Respect people's boundaries and preferences, especially when it comes to gender identity.
5. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for genderqueer individuals to connect and socialize without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can include designated areas for gender expression or identity exploration.
6. Diversity in Leadership: Ensure that your event leadership team reflects the diversity of your community, including gender identity. Have a diverse group of leaders who understand and can advocate for the needs of all participants.
7. Accessibility: Ensure that your event is accessible to people of all abilities and mobility levels. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and assistive listening devices.
8. Family-Friendly Environment: Create a family-friendly environment that welcomes genderqueer individuals and their families. Provide childcare services or designated areas for families to spend time together.
9. Partnerships with Genderqueer Organizations: Partner with local genderqueer organizations to co-host your event or promote it within their networks. This can help attract a more diverse crowd and provide additional support.
