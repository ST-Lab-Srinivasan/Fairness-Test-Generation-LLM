As a native Chinese speaker who is also a natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system:

1. Language barriers: Depending on where you live and the type of legal proceedings you encounter, you may face language barriers in communicating with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals. Even if you are fluent in English, there may be specific legal terms or jargon that you are not familiar with, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system.
