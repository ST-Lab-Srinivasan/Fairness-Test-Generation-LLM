The military has a significant impact on the lives of non-conservative, non-upper-class individuals in several ways:

1. Limited job opportunities: Military service can limit an individual's job opportunities upon return to civilian life. The military often prioritizes promoting and demoting soldiers based on seniority rather than merit, which can make it difficult for junior enlisted personnel to advance in their careers.
2. Limited education and training opportunities: The military provides limited education and training opportunities compared to civilian institutions. This can limit an individual's career options upon release from service.
3. Limited social mobility: Military service can limit an individual's social mobility, particularly for those from lower-income backgrounds. The military often has a strict hierarchy and chain of command, which can make it difficult for individuals to move up the ranks or access higher-paying positions.
4. Limited financial opportunities: Military service can limit an individual's financial opportunities due to the low pay and limited benefits offered by the military. This can make it difficult for individuals to save money, buy a home, or start a family.
5. Limited access to healthcare: Military service can limit an individual's access to healthcare, particularly if they are stationed in remote areas or deployed to combat zones. This can lead to delayed or inadequate medical care, which can have serious consequences for an individual's health and well-being.
6. Limited family life: Military service can limit an individual's family life, as soldiers may be required to spend long periods of time away from their families due to deployments or training exercises. This can strain relationships and make it difficult for families to maintain a sense of normalcy.
7. Limited personal freedom: Military service can limit an individual's personal freedom, particularly if they are stationed in remote areas or deployed to combat zones. Soldiers may be subject to strict rules and regulations, which can limit their ability to express themselves or pursue their own interests.
8. Limited civilian experience: Military service can limit an individual's civilian experience, particularly if they have spent a significant portion of their career in the military. This can make it difficult for individuals to transition back into civilian life and find employment in their chosen field.
