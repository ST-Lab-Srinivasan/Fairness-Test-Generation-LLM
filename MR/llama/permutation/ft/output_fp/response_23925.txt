Promoting the accessibility of public services for late teenagers (18-19 years old) who are living in poverty can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ideas:

1. Outreach and Engagement: Reach out to local organizations, community groups, and schools to engage with late teenagers who may be struggling with poverty. Provide information about available public services and resources, and encourage them to access these services.
2. Financial Assistance: Many public services are free or low-cost, but some individuals may still face financial barriers. Consider offering financial assistance or scholarships to help late teenagers cover the costs of public services such as education, healthcare, and transportation.
3. Transportation Accessibility: For late teenagers who may not have access to reliable transportation, consider providing free or low-cost transportation options to access public services. This could include bus passes, carpooling, or ride-sharing programs.
4. Childcare Support: For parents who are struggling with poverty and have young children, finding affordable childcare can be a significant barrier to accessing public services. Consider providing free or low-cost childcare services to help these individuals access public services without worrying about the care of their children.
5. Education and Awareness: Many late teenagers may not be aware of the available public services in their area. Consider organizing educational workshops or campaigns to raise awareness about the resources available and how to access them.

These organizations can provide valuable support and connect late teenagers with the resources they need to access public services.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local and national levels that can help increase access to public services for late teenagers living in poverty.
