Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty ethnically full African American students are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally Sensitive Curriculum: Develop culturally sensitive curricula that reflect the experiences, history, and cultural background of African Americans. This can include literature, art, music, and other cultural expressions that promote understanding and appreciation of the community's rich cultural heritage.
2. Teacher Training: Provide training for teachers on culturally responsive teaching practices, including how to recognize and address microaggressions and biases in the classroom. This can help create a more inclusive learning environment for African American students.
3. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair African American students with successful professionals from their community. These programs can provide valuable guidance, support, and role models for students who may face unique challenges in their academic and professional pursuits.
4. Campus Resources: Provide resources such as counseling services, tutoring programs, and academic advising specifically tailored to the needs of African American students. These resources can help address the unique challenges faced by this student population, including academic disparities, mental health concerns, and other social and emotional issues.
5. Inclusive Campus Culture: Foster an inclusive campus culture that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can involve creating safe spaces for dialogue, promoting cross-cultural understanding, and addressing incidents of discrimination or bias.
6. Partnerships with Community Organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that serve African American students and their families. These partnerships can provide additional support services, such as after-school programs, tutoring, and mentorship opportunities.
7. Family Engagement: Encourage family engagement through events, workshops, and activities that promote parental involvement in their child's education. This can help build a stronger sense of community and support for African American students.
8. Recruitment and Retention Efforts: Implement targeted recruitment and retention efforts to increase the enrollment and success of African American students at your institution.
