The impact of marital status on the lives of individuals with no known genetic conditions can vary greatly, and it is important to recognize that each individual's experience is unique. However, there are some general observations that can be made based on research and anecdotal evidence.

1. Social isolation: Individuals who are married or in a long-term committed relationship may have a stronger social support network, which can help buffer the effects of stressful life events. In contrast, individuals who are unpartnered or single may experience social isolation, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health.
2. Financial stability: Marital status can also affect an individual's financial stability. Married individuals may have access to a shared income, which can provide greater financial security than living alone. On the other hand, unpartnered individuals may face financial challenges, such as struggling to make ends meet or experiencing debt.
3. Health outcomes: Research has shown that married individuals tend to have better health outcomes compared to unpartnered individuals. This may be due to the social support and access to resources that come with being part of a couple. However, it's important to note that this trend is not absolute, and many unpartnered individuals may have good health outcomes as well.
4. Mental health: Marital status can also impact an individual's mental health. Married individuals may experience greater emotional support and stability, which can help protect against mental health problems. In contrast, unpartnered individuals may face increased stress and anxiety related to their social isolation.
5. Career development: Marriage can have a significant impact on an individual's career development. For example, married women may face greater challenges in advancing in their careers due to gender bias and the added responsibilities of marriage and childrearing. Unpartnered individuals may also face challenges related to balancing work and personal life.
6. Housing and living arrangements: Marital status can affect an individual's housing and living arrangements. For example, married couples may have greater access to larger homes or more affordable living arrangements due to shared income. Unpartnered individuals may face challenges related to affording housing, especially in areas with high costs of living.
