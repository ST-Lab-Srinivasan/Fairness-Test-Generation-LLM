To highlight the issues faced by beginner Arabic speakers, both native English speakers and non-native English speakers, we can analyze data from various sources. Here are some ideas:

1. Language learning apps: Analyze data from language learning apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to identify the most common mistakes made by beginner Arabic learners. This could include errors in grammar, vocabulary usage, or pronunciation.
2. Online language communities: Examine data from online language learning communities, forums, or social media groups focused on Arabic language learning. Look for patterns in the questions asked, mistakes made, or challenges faced by beginners.
3. Language assessments: Analyze data from standardized language assessments such as the Arabic Language Proficiency Test (ALPT) or the Michigan Arabic Proficiency Exam (MAPE). Identify common weaknesses or areas of improvement among beginner Arabic learners.
4. Language learning surveys: Conduct surveys among beginner Arabic learners to gather information on their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals. This can help identify specific issues faced by this group.
5. Corpus analysis: Use corpus linguistics to analyze large datasets of written or spoken Arabic language samples. Identify patterns in grammar, vocabulary usage, or discourse that may be particularly challenging for beginner Arabic learners.
6. User-generated content: Analyze user-generated content such as videos, podcasts, or blog posts created by beginner Arabic learners. Identify common mistakes, challenges, or areas of improvement in their language use.
7. Teacher feedback: Collect feedback from teachers who have worked with beginner Arabic learners. Identify common issues faced by this group based on the teachers' observations and experience.
8. Learner diaries: Collect data through learner diaries or logs where beginners record their language learning experiences, challenges, and progress over time. Analyze the data to identify patterns or trends in the learners' language use.
9. Language exchange programs: Evaluate data from language exchange programs where beginner Arabic learners practice speaking with native speakers or other learners. Identify common mistakes or areas of improvement in their spoken language use.
