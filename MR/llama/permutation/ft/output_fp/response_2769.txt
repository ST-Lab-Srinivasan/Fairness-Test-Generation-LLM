Ensuring the educational needs of beginner Spanish speakers who have been divorced multiple times can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help meet their needs:

1. Assess their language learning style: Begin by assessing the student's language learning style to determine how they prefer to learn and absorb information. This will help tailor the teaching methods to meet their individual needs.
2. Use a variety of teaching methods: Use a variety of teaching methods, such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic (hands-on) approaches, to cater to different learning styles. For example, you could use videos, audio recordings, and interactive activities to engage students in different ways.
