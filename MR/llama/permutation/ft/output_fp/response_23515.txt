Native Spanish speakers aged over 90 (or over 85) may face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Older adults who are native Spanish speakers may struggle to communicate with healthcare providers who do not speak their language fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and inadequate treatment.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Many older adults in rural or underserved areas may have limited access to healthcare services due to geographic barriers or lack of transportation.
