This can include offering a variety of activities that cater to different interests and preferences, such as art, music, dance, language classes, or sports. Ensure that the program is structured in a way that promotes mutual respect, understanding, and appreciation among all participants.

This can be done through group discussions, cultural exchange events, or collaborative projects that bring together individuals from different backgrounds.
