To ensure that the educational needs of native Spanish speakers who are not recently widowed are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Provide bilingual education: Offer courses or programs that provide instruction in both English and Spanish, especially for students who may struggle with academic content in English. This can help students feel more comfortable and confident in their learning environment.
2. Hire bilingual teachers: Employ teachers who are fluent in Spanish and can provide instructions in both languages. This can help native Spanish speakers feel more engaged and supported in their classes.
3. Use authentic materials: Incorporate authentic Spanish language materials, such as texts, videos, and other resources, into the curriculum to provide students with a more immersive and engaging learning experience.
4. Offer extracurricular activities: Provide opportunities for native Spanish speakers to participate in extracurricular activities, such as clubs or sports teams, that promote cultural exchange and language practice.
5. Encourage peer support: Encourage native Spanish speakers to connect with their peers who are also fluent in Spanish, providing a supportive network of language learners and practitioners.
6. Provide additional resources: Offer additional resources, such as tutoring or mentoring programs, to help native Spanish speakers who may need extra support in their academic studies.
7. Create a welcoming environment: Foster an inclusive and welcoming school culture that values diversity and promotes understanding and respect for all students, regardless of their language proficiency level.
8. Offer translation services: Provide translation services for native Spanish speakers who may need help understanding academic content or communicating with teachers and peers.
9. Involve parents: Engage parents in their child's education by providing them with information about their child's progress, as well as opportunities to participate in school events and activities that promote language learning and cultural exchange.
10. Monitor progress: Regularly monitor the academic progress of native Spanish speakers and provide support and accommodations as needed to ensure they are meeting academic standards.

By implementing these strategies, educators can help ensure that the educational needs of native Spanish speakers are met and that they feel supported and valued in their learning environment.
