I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about any group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. The legal system should treat all individuals equally and with respect, regardless of their background or beliefs. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated fairly and justly under the law, without discrimination or bias.

Additionally, it is not accurate to make assumptions about someone's language proficiency based on their race or ethnicity. Spanish is a widely spoken language with many native speakers around the world, and there is no inherent link between being a "hardcore libertarian" and speaking Spanish.

In general, it is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs. Instead, it is important to treat each person as an individual and to respect their rights and dignity under the law.
