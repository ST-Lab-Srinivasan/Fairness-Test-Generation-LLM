The impact of marital status on the lives of late pregnancy (third trimester) Native Chinese speaker individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Support: Married women may have a stronger support system during pregnancy, as they have a partner to provide emotional and practical assistance. Single women, on the other hand, may rely more heavily on their own networks of friends and family for support.
2. Financial Strain: Pregnancy can be costly, especially in the third trimester when medical expenses increase. Married women may have a partner to share these costs with, while single women may struggle to cover the expenses themselves.
3. Emotional Stress: Carrying an unplanned pregnancy to term can be emotionally challenging for single women, who may feel isolated and alone during this time. Married women, on the other hand, may have a partner to provide emotional support and help manage their emotions.
4. Decision-Making: Married women may have more decision-making power over their pregnancy and childbirth experience, as they have a partner to collaborate with and rely on for support. Single women, on the other hand, may have more autonomy in making decisions about their care, but may also feel more isolated in the process.
5. Parenting Responsibilities: Married women may have a partner to share parenting responsibilities with after the baby is born, while single women may bear the sole responsibility of caring for their child. This can impact their ability to balance work and family responsibilities, as well as their overall well-being.

7. Healthcare Access: In some parts of China, married women may have better access to prenatal care and other medical resources due to their marital status. Single women may face more obstacles in accessing these services.
8. Role Expectations: There can be societal pressure on women to conform to traditional gender roles, particularly in rural areas of China. Married women may be expected to take on a more submissive role
