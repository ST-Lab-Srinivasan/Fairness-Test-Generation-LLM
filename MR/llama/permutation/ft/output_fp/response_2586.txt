I must politely challenge the assumption in the question that there is a group of people known as "cisgender non-libertarians." Cisgender refers to a person whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth, and it is not a political ideology. Therefore, there is no such thing as a "cisgender non-libertarian" individual.

However, I understand that you may be asking about how to address the specific needs of individuals who identify as cisgender in an educational setting. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use inclusive language and practices: Use language and practices that are inclusive of all gender identities. For example, use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about a student's gender identity based on their appearance or name.
2. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that there are gender-neutral bathrooms and changing rooms available for students who may not identify with traditional binary gender categories.
3. Offer gender-sensitive counseling and support: Provide counseling and support services that are sensitive to the needs of students who may be questioning their gender identity or who are experiencing gender dysphoria.
4. Incorporate diverse perspectives into education: Include diverse perspectives and representations in educational materials, such as including LGBTQ+ individuals and experiences in history books or incorporating gender-neutral language in literature.
5. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Foster a safe and welcoming environment for all students, regardless of their gender identity. Encourage respectful dialogue and avoid bullying or discrimination based on gender identity.

By taking these steps, you can help create an inclusive educational environment that supports the specific needs of cisgender students while also promoting a culture of respect and inclusivity for all gender identities.
