Creating more inclusive recreational activities for combat-recently retired veterans who identify as strong atheists can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help make these activities more welcoming and accessible. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their beliefs and values: It's essential to understand the beliefs and values of the veterans you're trying to reach. As a strong atheist, they may have certain views on religion and spirituality that could impact their participation in recreational activities that involve religious or spiritual elements. Be respectful of their beliefs and avoid any activities that could be seen as promoting religious ideologies.
2. Focus on secular activities: To create more inclusive recreational activities, focus on secular activities that don't promote any particular religion or spirituality.

3. Use inclusive language: When advertising the recreational activities, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all beliefs. Avoid using language that could be seen as exclusive or discriminatory.
4. Offer flexible options: Not all combat-recently retired veterans may identify as atheists, so it's essential to offer flexible options that can accommodate people with different beliefs and values.

5. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops that can help veterans understand the benefits of recreational activities and how they can improve their mental and physical health. This can help build confidence and encourage participation from those who may be hesitant due to their beliefs or values.

Encourage them to connect with each other and share their experiences, both positive and negative, in a safe and respectful environment.
7. Collaborate with other organizations: Collaborating with other organizations that cater to combat-recently retired veterans can help expand
