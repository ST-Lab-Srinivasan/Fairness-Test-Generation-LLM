7. Encourage Retirement Savings: Encourage them to start saving for retirement as early as possible, even if it's just a small amount each month. This will help them build up their retirement savings over time and prepare for the future.
8. Offer Financial Planning Services: Offer financial planning services that can help them create a personalized financial plan that takes into account their unique situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
9. Provide Access to Financial Tools: Provide access to financial tools such as budgeting apps, investment platforms, or insurance products that can help them manage their finances more effectively.
