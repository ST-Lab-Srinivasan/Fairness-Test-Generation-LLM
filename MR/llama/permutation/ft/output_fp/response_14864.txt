Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of not recently single late 30s individuals. Here are some potential effects:

This can be particularly challenging for those in their late 30s who may have already established their careers.
2. Financial Stability: Military service can provide a stable income and benefits, but it can also impact an individual's financial stability upon transitioning back to civilian life.
