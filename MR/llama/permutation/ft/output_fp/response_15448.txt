As a permanent resident of the United States, there are several challenges that you may face when accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barriers: Many employed permanent residents may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties in communicating with healthcare providers and navigating the healthcare system.
2. Lack of health insurance: Some employed permanent residents may not have access to health insurance, either because their employer does not offer it or they cannot afford it. This can make it difficult to pay for medical services out of pocket.
3. Limited healthcare provider options: Depending on where you live, there may be a shortage of healthcare providers who speak your native language or have experience treating people from your cultural background.
4. Long wait times: Many employed permanent residents may face long wait times for appointments or procedures, especially if they are seen as a non-urgent case.
5. Difficulty accessing specialist care: Depending on where you live and the type of specialist care you need, it may be difficult to find a provider who can see you in a timely manner.
6. High out-of-pocket costs: Even if you have health insurance, many employed permanent residents may face high out-of-pocket costs for medical services, such as copays and deductibles.
7. Limited access to preventive care: Some employed permanent residents may not have access to preventive care, such as annual physicals or well-child visits, due to financial constraints or lack of transportation.
8. Discrimination or bias: Unfortunately, some employed permanent residents may face discrimination or bias in the healthcare system, particularly if they are from a marginalized community.
9. Lack of culturally competent care: Some employed permanent residents may not receive culturally competent care, which can result in misunderstandings or miscommunications between them and their healthcare providers.
10. Barriers to advance directives: Employed permanent residents may face barriers when trying to complete advance directives, such as living wills or medical powers of attorney, due to lack of knowledge or access to legal assistance.

It's important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the individual and their specific circumstances. However
