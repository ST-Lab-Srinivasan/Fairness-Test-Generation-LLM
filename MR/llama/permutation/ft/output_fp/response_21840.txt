Creating more inclusive cultural events for individuals in the first trimester of their pregnancy, including those who identify as partially asexual, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities and expressions. Avoid using terms that assume sexuality or imply that pregnancy is only relevant to cisgender women. For example, use "pregnant individuals" instead of "pregnant women."
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event space is accessible for individuals with mobility issues, including those who may be experiencing morning sickness or other symptoms associated with pregnancy. Provide seating options and ensure that the space is well-ventilated.
3. Gender-neutral marketing: Avoid using gendered language or imagery in promotional materials. Instead, use language that is inclusive of all genders, such as "Join us for a fun cultural event!" or "Everyone is welcome!"
4. Inclusive programming: Plan cultural events that are relevant and engaging for individuals of all genders and sexualities. Consider including events that celebrate pregnancy and parenthood in an inclusive way, such as a reading group or art exhibition focused on themes of family, identity, and growth.
5. Safe space policy: Develop a safe space policy that outlines expectations for respecting the boundaries and identities of all individuals involved in the event. Make sure to communicate this policy clearly to attendees beforehand.
6. Education and resources: Provide educational materials and resources that are inclusive of all genders and sexualities. This could include information on prenatal care, parenting, and identity-affirming activities.
7. Inclusive performance: Consider including performances or events that are relevant and engaging for individuals of all genders and sexualities. For example, you could have a poetry reading or music performance that celebrates pregnancy and parenthood in an inclusive way.
8. Intersectional approach: Acknowledge the intersections of identity, such as race, class, and ability, and how these intersections may impact an individual's experience of pregnancy and parenthood. Be mindful of the ways in which systemic oppression can affect individuals and their families
