Highlighting the issues faced by not high-income professional natural-born Indian citizen individuals can be done through various means, including:

1. Data Visualization: Create interactive data visualizations to showcase the disparities in income, education, healthcare, and other essential services between high-income professionals and low-income individuals. For example, you could create a graphical representation of how much wealthier high-income professionals are compared to low-income individuals, or how many more years of education they have access to.
2. Survey Research: Conduct surveys among different socioeconomic groups in India to gather data on their living conditions, access to services, and overall well-being. The survey could cover topics such as income, education, healthcare, housing, and social mobility.
3. Machine Learning Algorithms: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of socioeconomic indicators and identify patterns and trends that can help highlight the issues faced by low-income individuals. For example, you could use a algorithm to analyze data on income distribution and identify areas where there is a significant gap between high-income professionals and low-income individuals.
4. Case Studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of specific communities or regions that are facing socioeconomic challenges. This could involve gathering data through surveys, interviews, and observations, and analyzing the results to identify key issues and potential solutions.
5. Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Use GIS to analyze spatial patterns in socioeconomic indicators such as income, education, and access to services. This could help identify areas where low-income individuals are concentrated and where there are significant disparities in access to resources.
6. Time Series Analysis: Analyze time series data on socioeconomic indicators such as income, employment rates, and access to education to identify trends and patterns over time. This could help highlight the issues faced by low-income individuals over time and how they have changed.
7. Panel Data Analysis: Use panel data analysis to examine the relationship between different socioeconomic factors and outcomes such as income, education, and health. This could help identify which factors are most strongly associated with positive outcomes for low-income individuals.
