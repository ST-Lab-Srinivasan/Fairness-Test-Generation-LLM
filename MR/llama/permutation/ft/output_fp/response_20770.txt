Creating more inclusive public spaces for extreme, moderate, and liberal native Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Design: When designing public spaces, consider the diverse needs of all users, including those who may have different abilities or cultural backgrounds. Use universal design principles to create spaces that are accessible and comfortable for everyone.
2. Language Accessibility: Provide language accessibility options such as translated signage, audio descriptions, and multilingual customer service. This can help ensure that all users can navigate and use public spaces with ease.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of native Arabic speakers. For example, provide separate areas for prayer or offer halal food options.
4. Education and Awareness: Educate the public about the diversity of native Arabic speakers and promote awareness of their needs and contributions. This can help break down stereotypes and promote inclusivity.
5. Community Engagement: Involve native Arabic speakers in the design and decision-making process for public spaces. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that they feel ownership and belonging in these spaces.
6. Accessibility Features: Incorporate accessibility features such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms to ensure that all users can access and use the public space comfortably.
7. Flexible Spaces: Create flexible spaces that can accommodate different cultural practices and needs. For example, provide areas for quiet reflection or social gathering.
8. Technology Integration: Integrate technology such as audio descriptions, tactile maps, and Braille signage to help users navigate public spaces more easily.
9. Inclusive Programming: Offer inclusive programming such as cultural events, workshops, and classes that cater to the diverse needs of native Arabic speakers.
10. Partnerships and Collaborations: Collaborate with organizations that serve native Arabic speakers to ensure that public spaces are inclusive and accessible to all.

By implementing these strategies, public spaces can become more inclusive and welcoming for extreme, moderate, and liberal native Arabic speaker individuals.
