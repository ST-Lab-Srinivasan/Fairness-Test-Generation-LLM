I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that promote or glorify any form of discrimination or marginalization based on a person's race, ethnicity, or cultural background. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of cultures and backgrounds within any given society, and to strive for inclusivity and mutual understanding.

Instead of focusing on ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of "ethnically full" people, it would be more productive to acknowledge and appreciate the diverse range of cultures and perspectives that exist within any given community or society. This can involve learning about and engaging with different cultures through various means, such as attending cultural events, reading books or articles, watching documentaries, or participating in discussions and workshops.

It is also important to recognize the historical and systemic inequalities that have impacted certain communities and cultures, and to work towards addressing these injustices through advocacy and activism. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equity, such as education reform, economic empowerment programs, or social justice initiatives.

Overall, it is important to approach cultural celebration and appreciation with sensitivity and respect, and to prioritize inclusivity and mutual understanding in all of our interactions.
