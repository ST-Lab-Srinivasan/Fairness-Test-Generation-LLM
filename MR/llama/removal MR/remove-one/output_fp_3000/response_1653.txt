As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or marginalization towards any group of individuals, including those with disabilities. All students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and have equal access to quality education.

Instead of focusing on the "extreme ultra" category of students, it's important to recognize that every individual has their unique strengths, challenges, and learning styles. Here are some strategies that can promote the educational success of all students:

1. Inclusive education: Foster an inclusive learning environment where every student feels valued and respected. Provide accommodations and modifications to support students with diverse needs.
2. Differentiated instruction: Adapt teaching methods to meet the diverse needs of students, including those with disabilities. Use various teaching strategies, such as universal design for learning (UDL), to engage all learners.
3. Accessible materials: Ensure that educational materials are accessible to all students, including those with disabilities. Use technology and other tools to provide equal access to information.
4. Supportive staff: Train teachers and staff on how to support students with diverse needs. Provide mentorship and coaching to help them understand the unique challenges faced by these students.
5. Collaboration with parents: Work closely with parents of students with disabilities to understand their child's needs and develop strategies for supporting them in the educational setting.
6. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local organizations that support individuals with disabilities, such as advocacy groups or service providers. These partnerships can offer additional resources and support for students with disabilities.
7. Professional development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers and staff to learn about best practices in supporting students with diverse needs.
8. Positive attitude: Encourage a growth mindset and positive attitude towards inclusive education. Foster a culture of respect, empathy, and inclusivity within the school community.
9. Technology integration: Leverage technology to support students with disabilities, such as text-to-speech software, speech-to-text software, or other assistive devices.
10. Self-advocacy: Encourage students with disabilities
