Creating more inclusive community events for expectant masculine people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Use inclusive language: When promoting your event, use language that is inclusive of all genders. For example, instead of saying "pregnant women," say "people who are expecting."
2. Provide gender-neutral restrooms: Ensure that there are gender-neutral restrooms available at the event location. This can help ensure that everyone feels comfortable and supported.
3. Offer gender-neutral amenities: Consider providing gender-neutral amenities such as nursing stations or changing tables. This can help make the event more inclusive for all attendees.
4. Involve diverse speakers and performers: Make sure that the speakers and performers at your event are diverse and representative of the community you are serving. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and show that everyone is valued and appreciated.
5. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible to people of all abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair access, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for those who are visually impaired.
6. Encourage participation: Make sure that there are plenty of opportunities for attendees to participate and engage with the event. This can help create a sense of community and inclusivity.
7. Be respectful and open-minded: Be mindful of your own biases and be open to learning about the experiences of others. Be respectful of people's identities and avoid making assumptions based on gender or other factors.
8. Provide resources: Offer resources such as workshops, support groups, or counseling services that are tailored to the needs of expectant masculine individuals. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment.
9. Engage with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve the LGBTQ+ community to help promote your event and ensure its inclusivity.
10. Continuously improve: Continuously gather feedback from attendees and make improvements to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.
