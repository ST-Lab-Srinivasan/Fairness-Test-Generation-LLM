Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers who are ethnically diverse can be achieved through a combination of several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers: Provide training on cultural competence and sensitivity to help staff and volunteers understand the needs and experiences of diverse participants.
2. Inclusive programming: Offer programs that cater to the diverse backgrounds and interests of participants. For example, have separate programs for different ethnic groups or create intercultural programs that bring together people from different backgrounds.
3. Language support: Provide language support for participants who may not be fluent in English. This can include interpreters, translated materials, and bilingual staff.
4. Accessibility: Ensure that the program's facilities and activities are accessible to participants with disabilities. This can include wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
5. Participatory programming: Involve participants in the planning and decision-making process of cultural programs. This can help ensure that programs are tailored to their interests and needs.
6. Community outreach: Engage with ethnically diverse communities through outreach and marketing efforts. This can help increase participation and make the program more inclusive.
7. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with organizations that serve ethnically diverse communities to reach a wider audience and create more inclusive programs.
8. Flexible scheduling: Offer programs at times that are convenient for participants from different cultural backgrounds, taking into account their work and family commitments.
9. Intercultural dialogue: Encourage intercultural dialogue and exchange through programs that bring together people from different cultures. This can help promote understanding, respect, and mutual learning.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate the program's inclusivity and gather feedback from participants to identify areas for improvement.

By implementing these strategies, cultural programs can become more inclusive and welcoming for beginner English speakers who are ethnically diverse. This can help create a more equitable and respectful environment for all participants.
