I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including ethnic-based elitism. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Celebrating the cultural contributions of a particular group of people based on their ethnicity is not only discriminatory but also reinforces harmful stereotypes and divisions within society.

Instead, it's important to recognize and appreciate the diverse cultural heritage of all communities and individuals. This can involve learning about and celebrating different cultures through various forms of expression, such as music, art, literature, food, and dance. By promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange, we can foster a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone can feel valued and respected.

Remember, cultural diversity is not something to be celebrated in isolation but rather as an integral part of our shared humanity. Let's work together to build bridges of understanding and create a world that values and embraces the unique contributions of every individual.
