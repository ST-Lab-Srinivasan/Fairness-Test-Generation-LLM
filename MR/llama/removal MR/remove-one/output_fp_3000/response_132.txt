Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique cultural, historical, and socio-economic backgrounds. Here are some strategies that can help combat long-term educational disparities:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American students have faced centuries of oppression and trauma, which can affect their academic performance. Educators must be aware of these historical and ongoing impacts and incorporate culturally responsive teaching practices into their classes. This includes using teaching methods that are grounded in the students' cultural knowledge and values, and creating a safe and inclusive learning environment.
2. Language revitalization: Many Native American communities have experienced language loss due to colonization and assimilation policies. Revitalizing indigenous languages can help students connect with their culture and heritage, leading to improved academic outcomes.

Educators can address these challenges by incorporating identity-based education into the curriculum. This approach encourages students to explore their cultural identities, values, and beliefs, while also fostering empathy and understanding among all students.
