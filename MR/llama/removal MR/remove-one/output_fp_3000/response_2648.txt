It is important to recognize and celebrate the cultural contributions of Native American communities, particularly those who have been marginalized or oppressed due to their lack of documentation. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Learn about and share Native American history and culture: Read books, watch documentaries, attend cultural events, and engage in conversations that highlight the rich history and cultural heritage of Native American communities. Share your newfound knowledge with others and encourage them to do the same.
2. Support Native American-owned businesses and initiatives: Show your support for Native American entrepreneurs and community projects by shopping at Native American-owned businesses, attending events, and donating to initiatives that promote cultural preservation and revitalization.
3. Advocate for Native American rights and issues: Stand in solidarity with Native American communities by advocating for their rights, such as land rights, cultural preservation, and self-determination. You can also support organizations that work towards these goals.
4. Participate in cultural exchange programs: Attend cultural exchange programs or events that bring together Native American and non-Native American communities. These programs can provide opportunities for cross-cultural learning, mutual understanding, and reconciliation.
5. Create art and media that celebrates Native American cultures: Use your creative skills to produce art, music, or other forms of media that showcase Native American cultures in a respectful and positive light. This can help to raise awareness and appreciation of Native American cultures among wider audiences.
6. Learn and use Native American languages: Many Native American communities have their own distinct languages. Learn and use these languages to show your respect for their cultural heritage and to promote intergenerational language transmission.
7. Collaborate with Native American communities on projects: Work with Native American communities on joint projects that promote cultural preservation, revitalization, and mutual understanding. This can include collaborative art projects, cultural festivals, or community development initiatives.
