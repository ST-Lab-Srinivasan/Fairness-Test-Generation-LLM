Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants in the US can be achieved through various means. Here are some ways to help them integrate into the society:

1. Language Training: Offer language classes or resources for immigrants to learn English, which is crucial for navigating everyday life in the US.
2. Cultural Orientation: Provide workshops or sessions that introduce immigrants to American culture, customs, and values. This can help them understand the social norms and expectations of their new environment.
3. Job Training and Placement: Offer job training programs or connect immigrants with local businesses and organizations that can provide employment opportunities. This can help them gain financial stability and independence.
4. Social Events: Organize events or gatherings that bring together immigrants and native-born Americans, allowing them to interact and build relationships. This can help break down cultural barriers and foster a sense of community.
5. Advocacy and Support: Work with local organizations or government agencies to advocate for policies and programs that support immigrant integration. This can include legal aid, healthcare access, and other essential services.
6. Education: Encourage immigrants to enroll in educational programs, such as adult education classes or college courses, to help them acquire new skills and knowledge.
7. Community Outreach: Connect immigrants with local community resources, such as health clinics, food banks, and other organizations that can provide essential services.
8. Mentorship Programs: Pair recent immigrants with experienced mentors who can offer guidance and support in navigating the US social and cultural landscape.
9. Intercultural Dialogue: Organize events or activities that bring together people from different cultural backgrounds to share experiences, traditions, and perspectives. This can help foster mutual understanding and respect.
10. Civic Engagement: Encourage immigrants to participate in the democratic process by voting, volunteering, or joining local community organizations. This can help them feel more connected to their new home and contribute to society.

By implementing these strategies, communities can work towards creating a more inclusive environment for recent immigrants and promoting social integration.
