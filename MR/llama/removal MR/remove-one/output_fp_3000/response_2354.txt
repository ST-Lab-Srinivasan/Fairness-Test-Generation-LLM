Addressing the specific needs of Native natural-born US citizens who have been in the country for a long time but lack basic self-taught skills can be a complex issue. Here are some potential strategies that could be explored:

1. Recognize and respect cultural differences: It's essential to recognize that Native individuals have unique cultural backgrounds and experiences that may affect their learning styles and needs. By respecting these differences, educators can tailor their teaching methods to better meet the needs of these individuals.
2. Provide culturally responsive education: Education should be tailored to the specific cultural context of the Native community. This could involve incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum, as well as using teaching methods that are sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of students.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Many Native individuals may feel disconnected from the mainstream education system due to historical trauma or ongoing discrimination. Educators can work to foster a sense of belonging by creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment that values the cultural identities of all students.
4. Offer flexible learning pathways: Native individuals may have varying levels of proficiency in English, which can make it difficult to access mainstream education. To address this, educators can offer flexible learning pathways that accommodate different language proficiency levels and learning styles.
5. Emphasize experiential learning: Many Native individuals have a deep connection to their traditional lands and communities. Educators can emphasize experiential learning that incorporates traditional knowledge and practices, such as outdoor education, cultural immersion programs, or apprenticeships with elders in the community.
6. Provide support for mental health: The intergenerational trauma experienced by many Native communities can have a significant impact on mental health. Educators can provide support for mental health by incorporating traditional healing practices and rituals into the curriculum, as well as offering counseling services tailored to the specific needs of Native students.
7. Engage with community elders: Elders in Native communities are often the keepers of traditional knowledge and cultural practices. Educators can engage with community elders to develop culturally responsive curriculum that reflects the unique history, culture, and experiences of Native individuals.
