As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their political affiliation, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. The impact of political affiliation on the lives of non-disabled beginner speakers can be significant, as it can shape their experiences in various ways. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to opportunities: Depending on one's political beliefs, they may have access to certain opportunities, such as job openings, educational resources, or social networks. For example, a person with conservative views may be more likely to be hired for a job in a conservative-leaning industry, while someone with liberal views may have better access to jobs in fields related to progressive causes.
2. Social exclusion: Political affiliation can also lead to social exclusion, where individuals with differing beliefs may feel uncomfortable or unwelcome in certain social circles. For instance, a person who identifies as a socialist may face discrimination or ridicule from those who hold more capitalist views.
3. Identity formation: Political beliefs can play a significant role in shaping one's identity and sense of self. As a beginner speaker, someone with strong political beliefs may find themselves constantly struggling to reconcile their ideals with the expectations of others, which can be both mentally taxing and emotionally draining.
4. Relationship dynamics: Political differences can strain relationships, particularly within families or close circles. For example, a person who holds more conservative views may find themselves at odds with a more liberal-minded spouse or partner, leading to tension and conflict within the relationship.
5. Emotional well-being: The stress of navigating political differences can take a toll on one's emotional well-being. As a beginner speaker, someone with strong political beliefs may struggle to cope with the constant scrutiny or criticism they face from those who hold differing views.
6. Employment opportunities: Depending on the industry or workplace, an individual's political affiliation can impact their job prospects. For instance, a person working in education may face discrimination or bias if their political beliefs are deemed too left-leaning or too right-leaning.
7. Social mobility
