Creating more inclusive community events for native Chinese speaker upper people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Provide translation services: Offer translation services during the event, such as simultaneous interpretation or printed materials with key phrases in both English and Chinese. This will help non-English speakers participate fully in the event.
2. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids like pictures, videos, and props to help convey messages and ideas. This can be especially helpful for those who may not speak English fluently or at all.
3. Offer language support: Provide language support during the event, such as language classes or workshops, to help participants improve their English skills.
4. Make accommodations for cultural differences: Be sensitive to cultural differences and make accommodations as needed. For example, provide halal or kosher food options for Muslim or Jewish participants, or offer traditional Chinese clothing for participants to wear during the event.
5. Involve a diverse group of speakers: Ensure that your lineup of speakers is diverse and representative of different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This will help create a more inclusive environment and provide role models for participants.
6. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and respectful space for participants to share their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage open communication and active listening.
7. Offer accessible venues: Choose venues that are wheelchair accessible and have amenities like ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will ensure that all participants can fully participate in the event.
8. Provide subtitles or captions: Offer subtitles or captions during presentations to help non-English speakers follow along. This can also be helpful for those with hearing impairments.
9. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is offensive or exclusive. Use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about participants' identities or experiences.
10. Engage with local communities: Reach out to local communities and engage with them in the planning process. This will help ensure that your event is inclusive of diverse perspectives and needs.
