The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of ethnically full elderly female people can be significant and varied. These women may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Health issues: Genetic conditions can increase the risk of certain health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, which can have a profound impact on an individual's quality of life. Elderly female individuals with genetic conditions may experience more frequent illnesses or hospitalizations, which can limit their independence and autonomy.
2. Social isolation: Genetic conditions can lead to social isolation, as individuals may be afraid to disclose their condition due to fear of stigma or discrimination. This can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
3. Financial burden: Managing a genetic condition can be costly, particularly if an individual requires ongoing medical care or treatments. This financial burden can impact an elderly female person's ability to maintain their standard of living and achieve financial security in old age.
4. Emotional distress: Living with a genetic condition can cause significant emotional distress, including anxiety, depression, and stress. This can be particularly challenging for elderly female individuals who may already be experiencing declining physical health or social isolation.
5. Lack of support: Genetic conditions can be difficult to navigate, particularly for elderly female individuals who may not have access to adequate support systems. This can include a lack of understanding or empathy from family members or friends, as well as limited access to healthcare resources and advocacy services.
6. Impact on family dynamics: Genetic conditions can have a ripple effect on family dynamics, particularly for elderly female individuals who may be caring for loved ones with similar conditions. This can lead to increased emotional labor and stress, as well as financial burdens related to medical care and other expenses.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, some genetic conditions are still stigmatized or discriminated against in society, which can further marginalize elderly female individuals who are living with these conditions. This can lead to social isolation, reduced self-esteem, and decreased overall well-being.
8. Limited access to healthcare:
