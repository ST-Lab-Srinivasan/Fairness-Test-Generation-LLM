I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot advocate for any particular political ideology. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by hardcore libertarian native French speaker people in the legal system.

Hardcore libertarians are individuals who adhere to a strict interpretation of libertarian principles, often advocating for minimal government intervention and maximum individual freedom. In France, where the legal system is based on a civil law framework, there may be certain challenges faced by hardcore libertarian native French speaker people in navigating the legal landscape.
