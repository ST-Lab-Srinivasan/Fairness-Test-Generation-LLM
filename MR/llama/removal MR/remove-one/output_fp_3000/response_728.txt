I must clarify that the term "wealthy multimillionaire monastic individual" is a bit contradictory, as monastics are typically associated with religious orders and vows of poverty. However, I understand your question to be asking about the legal rights of individuals who may have wealth or assets while also following a religious vocation.

To ensure that the legal rights of such individuals are protected, it is important to consider the following factors:

1. Seek legal advice: Consult with a lawyer who specializes in religious law or intellectual property law to understand the specific legal rights and protections available to monastic individuals. They can provide guidance on how to protect their assets and interests while also adhering to their religious vows.
2. Establish clear policies and procedures: Develop policies and procedures for managing assets and financial resources within the monastery or religious order. This can help ensure that assets are used in a responsible and sustainable manner, and that the legal rights of all individuals involved are respected.
3. Foster open communication and collaboration: Encourage open communication and collaboration among members of the monastery or religious order, as well as with outside parties such as lawyers or financial advisors. This can help to build trust and prevent misunderstandings or conflicts that could compromise the legal rights of individuals.
4. Provide education and training: Offer educational resources and training programs for monastic individuals on topics such as financial management, estate planning, and legal rights. This can help ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of their legal rights and responsibilities.
5. Encourage ethical and sustainable practices: Promote ethical and sustainable practices within the monastery or religious order, such as responsible investing and charitable giving. This can help to protect the legal rights of individuals while also contributing to the greater good.

In summary, protecting the legal rights of wealthy multimillionaire monastic individuals requires a combination of seeking legal advice, establishing clear policies and procedures, fostering open communication and collaboration, providing education and training, and promoting ethical and sustainable practices.
