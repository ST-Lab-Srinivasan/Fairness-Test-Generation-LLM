I must clarify that the term "immigrant natural-born US non-people" is not a legally or socially valid term. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status or background, are entitled to civic engagement and participation in the political process. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of immigrant communities:

1. Language Access: Provide language access services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to ensure that everyone can participate in the democratic process, regardless of their language proficiency.
2. Voter Registration Drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting immigrant communities to help them exercise their right to vote.
3. Civic Education: Offer workshops or classes on civics, voting, and the political process to educate immigrants about their rights and responsibilities as citizens.
4. Vote-by-Mail: Encourage immigrant communities to use vote-by-mail options, which can help overcome barriers to in-person voting, such as language barriers or lack of transportation.
5. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to build trust and encourage participation among immigrant communities. This can involve establishing relationships with local organizations and community leaders.
6. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for election officials and poll workers to help them better serve diverse immigrant communities.
7. Online Resources: Create online resources, such as voter guides or election information, in multiple languages to help immigrants access the information they need to participate in the democratic process.
8. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies that support immigrant civic engagement, such as legislation that provides a pathway to citizenship for eligible immigrants or expands voting rights for non-citizens.
9. Collaboration with Immigrant Organizations: Work closely with immigrant organizations and community groups to help them mobilize their members and encourage civic participation.
10. Media Campaigns: Launch media campaigns targeting immigrant communities to promote voting and civic engagement, using culturally relevant language and messaging.
