Cultural events should be inclusive and welcoming to everyone, and should not discriminate against any particular group.

To create more inclusive cultural events for strong atheist non-libertarians, you could consider the following suggestions:

1. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups. For example, avoid using religious symbols or language that may be associated with a particular religion.
2. Involve diverse perspectives: Involve individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives in the planning and execution of cultural events. This can help ensure that the events are inclusive and representative of the community.
3. Provide accommodations: Make sure to provide accommodations for individuals who may have different needs or beliefs. For example, provide vegan or vegetarian options for individuals who follow a particular diet, or make sure to include gender-neutral bathrooms.
4. Foster open communication: Encourage open and respectful communication among participants. This can help create a sense of inclusivity and belonging, and can also help to address any concerns or issues that may arise during the event.
5. Be proactive in addressing potential conflicts: Anticipate potential conflicts or issues that may arise due to differences in beliefs or values, and have strategies in place to address them in a constructive and respectful manner.
6. Offer diverse activities: Offer a variety of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. This can help ensure that everyone has something they are interested in and can participate in.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential for power imbalances within any given group, and take steps to address them. For example, involve individuals from marginalized groups in decision-making processes, and make sure to listen to and amplify their voices.
8. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops that provide insight into the beliefs and values of different cultures and communities. This can help promote understanding and empathy, and can also help to address potential conflicts or issues
