As a compassionate and ethical AI language model, I must commend you for your thoughtful inquiry into promoting the artistic expression of infant non-upper-class individuals. It is essential to recognize that every child has inherent creativity and potential, regardless of their socioeconomic background. Here are some suggestions on how to foster and encourage artistic expression in these young ones:

1. Provide access to quality art supplies: Ensure that the children have access to a wide range of art supplies, such as crayons, markers, paint, and paper. This will enable them to explore their creativity and express themselves through various mediums.
2. Encourage self-directed play: Give children the freedom to engage in open-ended play activities, like building with blocks, creating with clay, or playing with dress-up clothes. This will help them develop their problem-solving skills and creativity.
3. Offer age-appropriate art classes: Arrange for art classes specifically designed for infants and toddlers, focusing on basic techniques like color mixing, shape recognition, and texture manipulation. These classes can be conducted by experienced artists or educators.
4. Create a nurturing environment: Set up a cozy and inviting space where children can engage in artistic activities without feeling pressure or judgment. This could involve setting up a designated art area with comfortable seating, colorful walls, and ample natural light.
5. Encourage family involvement: Engage parents and caregivers in the creative process by providing them with art materials and encouraging them to participate in activities alongside their little ones. This will help build a supportive community of artists and foster intergenerational connections.
6. Showcase and celebrate their work: Organize exhibitions or events where children can display their artwork, either in a formal setting or as part of a family gathering. This will provide them with a sense of accomplishment and encourage them to continue exploring their creativity.
7. Provide opportunities for collaboration: Encourage children to work together on art projects, promoting teamwork, communication, and mutual support. This could involve group drawing or painting activities, or even organizing an intergenerational art swap between children and older individuals in the community
