Creating more inclusive housing policies for mid-50s long-time residents involves understanding their unique needs and addressing the challenges they face. Here are some strategies that policymakers and housing providers can implement:

1. Age-friendly design: Develop housing that is adaptable to different stages of life, with features like wider hallways, easier-to-use kitchens, and bathrooms with grab bars. This can help reduce the physical burden on residents and make it easier for them to age in place.
2. Inclusionary zoning: Implement policies that require a certain percentage of new housing units to be designated as affordable for low-income households, including those with mid-50s long-time residents. This can help preserve the diversity of neighborhoods and ensure that these residents have access to affordable housing options.
3. Rent control: Implement rent control policies to prevent sudden increases in housing costs, which can be particularly challenging for low-income households, including those with mid-50s long-time residents.
4. Home repair loans and grants: Offer financial assistance to homeowners who need repairs or modifications to make their homes more accessible or easier to maintain. This can help address the physical challenges faced by mid-50s long-time residents and prevent displacement due to housing costs or maintenance needs.
5. Community land trusts: Establish community land trusts, which allow homeowners to sell or transfer their property rights while retaining ownership of the land underneath. This can help preserve affordable housing options for mid-50s long-time residents and prevent displacement due to gentrification or market forces.
6. Coordinated entry systems: Implement coordinated entry systems that prioritize housing needs based on vulnerability, such as homelessness or risk of homelessness. This can help ensure that mid-50s long-time residents are given priority access to available affordable housing options.
7. Supportive housing programs: Develop supportive housing programs that provide on-site services and resources, such as case management, mental health counseling, and job training. These programs can help address the social and economic challenges faced by mid-50s long-time residents and improve their overall well-being.
