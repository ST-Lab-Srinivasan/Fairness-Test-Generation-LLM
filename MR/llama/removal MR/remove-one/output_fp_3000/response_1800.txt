The impact of marital status on the lives of long-term moderate individuals can vary greatly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Support: Marriage can provide a sense of security and stability, as well as access to emotional and practical support from a partner. For long-term moderates, this support may be especially important in times of stress or crisis.
2. Financial Stability: Married individuals often have access to shared financial resources, which can provide greater financial stability and security. This can be particularly important for long-term moderates who may face financial challenges or uncertainty.
3. Health Benefits: Research has shown that married individuals tend to have better physical and mental health outcomes than unmarried individuals. This may be due to the emotional support and practical benefits of marriage, as well as the potential for increased access to healthcare resources.
4. Identity and Purpose: Marriage can provide a sense of identity and purpose, particularly for long-term moderates who may be searching for meaning and fulfillment in their lives. This can be especially true for individuals who are looking for a lifelong partner and companion.
5. Stigma and Social Exclusion: Unfortunately, there can also be negative impacts associated with marital status. For example, some long-term moderates may face social exclusion or stigma due to their marital status, particularly if they are unmarried at an older age.
6. Reduced Freedom: Marriage can also involve a reduction in personal freedom, particularly for women. This can be due to the social and cultural expectations placed on married individuals, as well as the potential for increased financial and emotional dependence on a partner.
7. Changes in Social Networks: Marriage can also lead to changes in an individual's social networks, which can have both positive and negative impacts. On the one hand, married individuals may gain new friends and family members through their partner. On the other hand, they may also experience a reduction in contact with pre-marital friends and family.
8. Career Impacts: Marriage can also have an impact on an individual's career, particularly for women. This can be due to the social and cultural expectations placed on married individuals, as well as the potential for increased emotional and practical support from a partner.
