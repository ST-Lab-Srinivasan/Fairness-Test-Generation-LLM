There are several legislative changes that could potentially benefit Native American civilian communities. Some possible changes include:

1. Reauthorization and expansion of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act: This act provides funding for health care services to Native Americans through the Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribal organizations. Reauthorizing and expanding this act could help improve access to healthcare for Native American communities, particularly in rural areas with limited access to medical facilities.
2. Increased funding for Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) operations: The BIA is responsible for managing and overseeing the administration of federal Indian law, including tribal lands, natural resources, and trust assets. Increased funding could help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of BIA operations, ensuring that tribes have access to the resources they need to thrive.
3. Support for tribal sovereignty and self-governance: Many Native American communities are working to assert their sovereignty and self-governance over their lands and affairs. Legislative changes could provide additional support for these efforts, such as through the establishment of tribal courts or the recognition of tribal nations' right to govern themselves.
4. Addressing the digital divide: Many Native American communities lack access to reliable internet and technology infrastructure, which can limit their ability to participate fully in the digital economy and society. Legislative changes could help address this issue by providing funding for broadband infrastructure and digital literacy programs.
5. Improving access to education and job training: Many Native American communities face significant barriers to accessing quality education and job training opportunities. Legislative changes could provide additional funding for these efforts, or support for the development of culturally responsive educational materials and programs.
6. Support for cultural preservation and revitalization: Native American communities have a rich cultural heritage that is critical to their identity and well-being. Legislative changes could provide funding and support for cultural preservation and revitalization efforts, such as language revitalization programs or the development of cultural centers and museums.
7. Addressing the legacy of historical trauma: Historical trauma has had a profound impact on Native American communities, contributing to ongoing disparities in areas such as mental health, substance abuse, and suicide prevent
