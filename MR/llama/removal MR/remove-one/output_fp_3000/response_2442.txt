The impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant (third trimester) Mexican individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Married individuals may have better access to healthcare services, including prenatal care, due to their spouse's employer-based insurance or other forms of coverage.
