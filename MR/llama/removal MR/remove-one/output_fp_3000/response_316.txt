Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent immigrants to Canada, particularly for those who are ethnically diverse. It provides a sense of belonging and connection to their ancestral culture, while also helping them navigate their new surroundings.

1. Sense of identity: Cultural heritage helps recent immigrants to Canada establish a strong sense of identity. It provides them with a shared history and common values that help them define who they are and where they come from. For example, a person from India may identify as both Indian and Canadian, drawing on both their cultural heritage and their citizenship to create a complex identity.
