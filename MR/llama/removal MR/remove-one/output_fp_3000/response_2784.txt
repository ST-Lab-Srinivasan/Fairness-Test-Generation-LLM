Creating more inclusive social policies for financially disadvantaged partnered individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various challenges faced by these individuals. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to education and job training: Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help financially disadvantaged partnered individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and degree programs in high-demand fields such as technology, healthcare, and finance.
2. Implement progressive taxation: Implementing a progressive tax system that reduces the burden on low-income earners and increases the tax burden on higher-income individuals can help reduce income inequality and redistribute wealth more evenly. This can include policies such as increasing taxes on luxury items, implementing a wealth tax, and increasing the minimum wage.
3. Strengthen social safety nets: Strengthening social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance, disability benefits, and housing assistance, can help provide financial support to financially disadvantaged partnered individuals who are struggling to make ends meet.
4. Address discrimination and inequality: Discrimination and inequality based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other factors can contribute to financial disadvantage for some groups. Addressing these issues through policies such as anti-discrimination laws and targeted support programs can help level the playing field and provide greater opportunities for all individuals.
5. Promote financial literacy: Many financially disadvantaged partnered individuals may lack access to financial resources and services, including credit, bank accounts, and investment advice. Promoting financial literacy and providing access to financial services can help these individuals make informed decisions about their finances and improve their overall financial well-being.
6. Encourage shared responsibility: Encouraging shared responsibility between partners in a relationship can help distribute financial responsibilities more evenly and reduce the burden on any one individual. This can include policies such as joint bank accounts, shared budgeting, and mutual support for financial goals.
7. Provide access to affordable childcare: Financially disadvantaged partnered individuals may struggle to balance work and family
