Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term temporary visa holders requires a comprehensive and nuanced approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges of this population. Here are some potential strategies for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the limbo: Long-term temporary visa holders often find themselves in a state of limbo, caught between their home countries and their host countries. Acknowledging this limbo and recognizing its impact on mental health and well-being can help create policies that address these issues.
2. Grant access to basic services: Long-term temporary visa holders often face barriers in accessing basic services such as healthcare, education, and employment. Policies that grant access to these services can help reduce inequality and promote social inclusion.
3. Provide pathways to citizenship: Offering clear paths to citizenship for long-term temporary visa holders can help them feel more secure and integrated in their host countries. This can also help reduce the likelihood of forced migration and promote social cohesion.
4. Address discrimination: Discrimination against long-term temporary visa holders is common, and can lead to social isolation and marginalization. Policies that address discrimination and promote diversity can help create a more inclusive society.
5. Foster community engagement: Long-term temporary visa holders often face challenges in integrating into their host communities. Policies that foster community engagement and encourage cross-cultural exchange can help promote social inclusion and reduce social isolation.
6. Provide financial support: Many long-term temporary visa holders face economic insecurity, which can exacerbate mental health issues and limit their access to basic services. Policies that provide financial support, such as low-interest loans or microfinance programs, can help reduce poverty and promote social inclusion.
7. Promote cultural exchange: Cultural exchange programs can help long-term temporary visa holders connect with their host communities and promote cross-cultural understanding. This can help reduce social tensions and promote social cohesion.
8. Address language barriers: Language barriers are a significant challenge for many long-term temporary visa holders, which can limit their access to basic services
