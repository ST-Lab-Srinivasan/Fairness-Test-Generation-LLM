Supporting communities living just above the poverty line can be a complex and challenging task, as these communities often face significant barriers to improving their socio-economic status. However, there are several effective strategies that have been shown to support these communities:

1. Community-led development: Encourage community members to take an active role in identifying and addressing the issues affecting their community. This can involve participatory planning and decision-making processes, which help build trust and ownership among community members.
