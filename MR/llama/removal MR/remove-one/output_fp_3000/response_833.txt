This could include featuring them in sports publications, highlighting their achievements on television and radio broadcasts, and showcasing their stories through social media campaigns.

This could include offering different times for practices or games, providing accommodations for religious or cultural observances, and creating programs that cater to individuals with different learning styles.
7. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for ethnically diverse athletes to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could include hosting workshops, seminars, or roundtable discussions where athletes can openly discuss their challenges and concerns.
