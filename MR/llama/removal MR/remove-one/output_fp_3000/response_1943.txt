Ensuring the financial well-being of very old (90s+) immigrant or recent immigrants to the US can be challenging, as they may face unique obstacles related to their age, language barriers, and cultural differences. Here are some ways to help meet their financial needs:

1. Access to healthcare: Many older immigrants may have pre-existing medical conditions or may be at risk for developing chronic diseases due to aging. Ensuring they have access to affordable and quality healthcare is crucial. This can be achieved by advocating for policies that provide affordable healthcare options, such as Medicare, Medicaid, or the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
2. Financial assistance programs: Many organizations offer financial assistance programs specifically designed to help older immigrants with basic needs such as housing, food, and utilities. These programs may provide emergency financial assistance, help with paying bills, or offer financial counseling.
3. Social Security benefits: Older immigrants who have worked in the US and paid Social Security taxes are eligible for Social Security benefits. Assisting them in understanding the application process and ensuring they receive their rightful benefits can help alleviate financial stress.
4. Language barriers: Many older immigrants may face language barriers, which can make it challenging to navigate financial systems. Providing translation services or connecting them with cultural interpreters can help overcome this obstacle.
5. Financial education: Offering financial literacy programs tailored to the needs of older immigrants can help them better understand their financial situation and make informed decisions about their money. This may include learning how to budget, manage debt, and save for retirement.
6. Capacity building: Building the capacity of organizations that serve older immigrants can help ensure they have access to the resources they need. This may involve providing training and technical assistance to these organizations to help them better serve their clients.
7. Advocacy: Advocating for policies that support the financial well-being of older immigrants can help address systemic issues that may hinder their financial security. This may include advocating for policies that protect their Social Security benefits, provide affordable housing options, or offer financial assistance programs specifically designed for this population.
