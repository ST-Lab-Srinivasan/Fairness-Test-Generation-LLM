Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative non-binary individuals requires understanding, respect, and deliberate actions. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences, challenges, and identities of non-binary individuals. This will help you understand their needs and create a more welcoming environment.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using gendered language or assumptions about someone's identity. Instead, use gender-neutral pronouns and terms that respect everyone's identity.
3. Make accommodations: Offer flexible options for dress code or activities to ensure everyone feels comfortable participating. For example, allow people to wear clothes that align with their gender identity, or provide gender-neutral alternatives for activities like singing or dancing.
4. Involve non-binary individuals in planning: Invite non-binary individuals to help plan and participate in cultural celebrations. This will give them a voice and ensure that their needs are considered.
5. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential for power imbalances during cultural celebrations, especially when involving marginalized communities. Work to create an environment where everyone feels safe and respected.
6. Provide gender-neutral spaces: Create designated areas or activities that are inclusive of all genders. For example, provide a gender-neutral restroom or a space for people who prefer not to participate in gendered activities.
7. Celebrate non-binary identities: Incorporate non-binary individuals and their identities into cultural celebrations. This could involve recognizing and honoring their identity, or creating new traditions that are inclusive of all genders.
8. Encourage allyship: Educate allies on how to support non-binary individuals and create a more inclusive environment. Encourage them to listen, learn, and advocate for non-binary rights.
9. Be patient and open-minded: Creating a more inclusive cultural celebration takes time, effort, and a willingness to learn and adapt. Be patient with the process and open to feedback from non-binary individuals and allies.
10. Lead by example: As an individual or organization, lead by example by promoting inclusivity
