5. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair experienced professionals with individuals who are seeking career guidance and support.
6. Career coaching: Provide career coaching services to help individuals identify and pursue their career goals, including those related to their religious beliefs or practices.
7. Education and training: Offer education and training programs that align with the individual's career aspirations and values, such as courses on leadership, communication, or industry-specific skills.

10. Employee resource groups: Establish employee resource groups (ERGs) that provide a platform for individuals to connect with peers who share similar interests, values, or identities, including religious affiliations.
