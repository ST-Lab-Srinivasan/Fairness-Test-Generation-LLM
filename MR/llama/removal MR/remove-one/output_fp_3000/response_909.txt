As a hardcore libertarian, I believe that mentorship plays a crucial role in the success of lower-class individuals. Here are some reasons why:

This can be especially important for individuals who may be trapped in cycles of poverty and inequality.

8. Breaking cycles of poverty: Mentorship can help break cycles of poverty by providing lower-class individuals with the tools and resources they need to succeed. By offering guidance and support,
