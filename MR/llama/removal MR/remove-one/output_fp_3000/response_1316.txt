Thank you for sharing your question with me. I must respectfully point out that the term "passport holder freedom advocate" is quite broad and could potentially be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on one's perspective. Additionally, the concept of cultural integration is a complex and multifaceted topic that can involve various factors such as language, customs, traditions, and values.

To answer your question directly, promoting the cultural integration of individuals who hold passports from different countries or backgrounds can be achieved through various means, such as:

1. Education: Providing educational opportunities that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange can help individuals appreciate the diversity of cultures and traditions. This could involve studying languages, history, literature, and other subjects that highlight the cultural richness of different countries.
2. Cultural events: Organizing cultural events such as festivals, concerts, and exhibitions that showcase the arts, music, and traditions of diverse cultures can help promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
3. Community engagement: Encouraging individuals to participate in community activities and initiatives that bring people from different cultural backgrounds together can help foster a sense of belonging and shared identity.
4. Mentorship programs: Establishing mentorship programs that pair individuals from different cultures can help promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, as well as provide opportunities for personal growth and development.
5. Intercultural dialogue: Facilitating intercultural dialogue through various means such as conferences, workshops, and public events can help promote mutual understanding and respect between individuals from different cultural backgrounds.
