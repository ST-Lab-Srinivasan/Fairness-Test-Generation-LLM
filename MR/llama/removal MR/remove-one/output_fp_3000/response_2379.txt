Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for native Arabic speakers who identify as partly asexual requires understanding and respecting their identity. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Consult with partly asexual individuals to understand their preferences and boundaries when it comes to cultural celebrations. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive and comfortable for them.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or expects them to participate in sexual activities.

3. Offer alternatives: Provide options for how people can participate in cultural celebrations without feeling uncomfortable or excluded. For example, offer non-sexual dance performances or art installations that are accessible to everyone.
