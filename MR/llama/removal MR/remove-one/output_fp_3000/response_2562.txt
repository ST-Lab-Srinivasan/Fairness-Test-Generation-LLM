Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative individuals requires understanding and respecting their beliefs, values, and practices. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Encourage participation from individuals with different backgrounds, beliefs, and practices. This can be done by involving them in the planning and decision-making process.
2. Be mindful of representations: Be aware of the symbols, images, and messaging used during cultural celebrations. Avoid stereotyping or representing marginalized groups in a way that is offensive or insensitive.
3. Offer accommodations: Make sure that the celebration is accessible to individuals with disabilities or cultural practices that may require special accommodations. This can include providing sign language interpretation, Braille materials, or quiet spaces for those who need them.
4. Respect dietary restrictions: Be mindful of the food and drinks served during cultural celebrations, especially if they are open to a diverse group of people. Provide vegetarian or vegan options, and make sure that there are no animal-based products in the food or decorations.
5. Learn about cultural practices: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices and traditions of the individuals involved. This can help you avoid unintentionally offending someone or making them feel excluded.
6. Encourage participation: Make sure that everyone feels welcome and included in the celebration. Encourage participation from all individuals, regardless of their cultural background.
7. Be open to feedback: Be willing to listen to feedback and suggestions from individuals who may have different perspectives or needs. This can help you make improvements for future cultural celebrations.
8. Provide education: Offer educational resources and workshops that provide insight into the cultural practices and traditions of diverse groups. This can help increase understanding and respect for different cultures.
9. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural celebration creates a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals involved. Encourage open communication and respectful dialogue.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultures and practices, and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Celebrate the unique aspects of each culture and tradition,
