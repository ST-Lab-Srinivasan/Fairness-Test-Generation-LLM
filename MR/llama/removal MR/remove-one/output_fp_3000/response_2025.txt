Title: Understanding the Impact of Political Affiliation on Beginner Arabic Speakers in Their Late 30s

Introduction:
As the world becomes increasingly globalized, understanding and communicating in different languages has become a valuable skill. Arabic, as one of the most widely spoken languages in the Middle East and North Africa, has gained significant attention in recent years. However, learning any new language can be challenging, especially for beginner speakers who are older and have busy lives. This study aims to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers in their late 30s.

Methodology:
This study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey was administered to a sample of 100 beginner Arabic speakers aged 35-45, recruited through social media platforms and language learning groups. The survey included questions on political affiliation, motivation for learning Arabic, time management, and the challenges faced in the learning process. Additionally, ten participants were selected for in-depth interviews to gather more detailed insights into their experiences.

Results:
The survey results showed that 60% of the participants identified as left-leaning, while 20% identified as right-leaning, and 20% as centrist or neutral. The motivation for learning Arabic was found to be diverse, with the majority (65%) citing personal interest or cultural enrichment as their primary reason. However, political affiliation had a significant impact on how participants managed their time for language learning. Left-leaning participants reported spending more time and effort in their language learning journey compared to right-leaning participants.

In-depth interviews revealed that the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers were primarily related to the complexities of the Arabic script, pronunciation, and grammar rules. However, political affiliation also played a role in shaping participants' attitudes towards learning Arabic. Left-leaning participants tended to view language learning as a means of promoting cultural understanding and global connectivity, while right-leaning participants saw it as a way to enhance their career prospects or maintain cultural heritage.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the complex interplay
