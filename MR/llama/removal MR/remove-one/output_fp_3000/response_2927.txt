Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed Non-Liberal Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those from mixed backgrounds. Non-liberal societies often have strict social norms and expectations that can make it challenging for individuals to navigate their cultural identities. This paper aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed non-liberal individuals and how they negotiate these complex identities.

Theory:
Cultural heritage is a crucial aspect of an individual's identity, as it provides a sense of belonging and connection to their ancestors and community. However, in non-liberal societies, cultural heritage can also be used to reinforce social hierarchies and power structures, which can make it challenging for individuals from mixed backgrounds to find their place within these societies.

Research Questions:

1. How do mixed non-liberal individuals navigate their cultural identities in a society that often places strict expectations on traditional gender roles and cultural practices?
2. What role does cultural heritage play in shaping the identities of mixed non-liberal individuals, and how do they negotiate these identities within their communities?
3. How do power dynamics and social hierarchies influence the way mixed non-liberal individuals experience and express their cultural identities?

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with mixed non-liberal individuals living in non-liberal societies. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques to ensure a diverse range of experiences and perspectives are represented.

Expected Outcomes:
The study aims to provide insights into the complex ways cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed non-liberal individuals. Specifically, it will reveal how power dynamics and social hierarchies shape these identities and how individuals navigate these complex identities within their communities.

Conclusion:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed non-liberal individuals. However, navigating these identities within non-
