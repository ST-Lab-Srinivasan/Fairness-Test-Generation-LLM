As a sociologist, I can argue that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals who are slightly non-liberarian. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society. For individuals who identify as slightly non-libertarian, their cultural heritage can shape their political beliefs and attitudes towards social issues in several ways:

1. Socialization: From a young age, individuals are socialized into certain values and beliefs that are passed down through their cultural heritage. This socialization process can influence how they view the role of government, the economy, and society.

5. Resistance to change: Cultural heritage can also influence an individual's willingness to accept change, especially if it challenges their deeply held beliefs and values. For example, if an individual grows up in a culture that places a high value on tradition and stability, they may be more resist
