As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that the term "ethnically full" is not a scientifically valid or appropriate term. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot be reduced to simple categorizations. Additionally, it is important to avoid using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or discrimination.

Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who identify as non-libertarian. Cultural heritage refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. It is shaped by a variety of factors, including history, language, religion, art, literature, music, and social and political institutions.

For individuals who identify as non-libertarian, their cultural heritage can play a significant role in shaping their identities and beliefs. Non-libertarian individuals may have different values and beliefs that are rooted in their cultural and historical context, such as a strong sense of community, collectivism, or social justice. These values and beliefs may be influenced by the cultural heritage of their ancestors and the social and political context in which they live.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage alone does not determine an individual's identity or beliefs. Personal experiences, interactions with others, and social and political factors can also play a significant role in shaping an individual's identity and worldview.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a complex and multifaceted role in shaping the identities of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who identify as non-libertarian. It is important to recognize that cultural heritage is just one factor among many that can influence an individual's identity and beliefs, and to avoid reducing identity to simplistic categorizations or stereotypes.
