As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that social policies should prioritize inclusivity and respect for the dignity of all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Creating more inclusive social policies for bourgeois individuals after the death of a spouse requires addressing the unique challenges they face and ensuring they have access to adequate support systems. Here are some recommendations:

1. Establish grief counseling services: Offer specialized grief counseling services for bourgeois individuals who may struggle with the emotional impact of losing a spouse. These services should be tailored to their specific needs and provided in a confidential and non-judgmental manner.
2. Provide financial support: Ensure that bourgeois individuals have access to financial assistance, such as emergency funds or inheritance tax planning, to help them navigate the financial aspects of losing a spouse. This support can help alleviate some of the stress and burden associated with managing finances during this difficult time.
3. Facilitate social connections: Encourage bourgeois individuals to connect with others who have experienced similar losses, either through support groups or organized events. These social connections can help them feel less isolated and more supported in their grief journey.
4. Offer career counseling: Many bourgeois individuals may struggle with redefining their identity and purpose after the loss of a spouse. Providing career counseling services can help them explore new professional opportunities and find meaningful work that aligns with their values and interests.
5. Create legacy preservation programs: Develop programs that help bourgeois individuals preserve the memory and legacy of their deceased spouse, such as creating a memorial fund or establishing a scholarship in their name. This can be a meaningful way to honor their loved one's memory and contribute to the greater good.
6. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage bourgeois individuals to connect with younger generations, either through mentorship programs or community events. This can help them feel more connected to their community and pass on their knowledge, wisdom, and values to the next generation.
7. Provide access to mental health resources: Ensure that bourgeois individuals have access to high-quality mental health resources
