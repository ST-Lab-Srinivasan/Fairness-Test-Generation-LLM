The impact of military status on the lives of mid-50s individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

2. Financial impacts: Serving in the military can have significant financial implications, including debt from education loans or other financial obligations that may be difficult to repay while serving. Additionally, military pay is generally lower than civilian pay, which can make it challenging to save for retirement or other financial goals.
