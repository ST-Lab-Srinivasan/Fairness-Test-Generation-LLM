Non-cisgender people, including transgender, genderqueer, and non-binary individuals, often face significant challenges when accessing healthcare services. Some of the common challenges include:

1. Misgendering or deadnaming: Providers may misgender or deadname a patient, which can be invalidating and disrespectful, leading to a lack of trust in the provider-patient relationship.
2. Lack of understanding and training: Many healthcare providers receive little or no training on how to care for non-cisgender patients, resulting in a lack of knowledge and understanding of their unique needs.
3. Inadequate care: Non-cisgender patients may face delays or denials of necessary medical procedures or treatments due to discrimination or bias from providers.
4. Lack of culturally competent care: Non-cisgender patients may not feel comfortable discussing their gender identity with providers, leading to a lack of culturally competent care.
5. Invasive and inappropriate treatment: Non-cisgender patients may experience invasive and inappropriate medical procedures, such as unnecessary genital exams or puberty blockers, due to a lack of understanding of their gender identity.
6. Lack of support: Non-cisgender patients may not have access to support services, such as gender-affirming care or mental health services, which can lead to feelings of isolation and distress.
7. Discrimination and stigma: Non-cisgender patients may face discrimination and stigma from providers, which can lead to a lack of trust and poorer health outcomes.
8. Difficulty accessing gender-affirming care: Non-cisgender patients may have difficulty accessing gender-affirming care, such as hormone therapy or gender confirmation surgeries, due to a lack of knowledge or support from providers.
9. Inadequate pain management: Non-cisgender patients may experience inadequate pain management due to provider bias or lack of understanding of their unique needs.
10. Lack of autonomy and decision-making: Non-cisgender patients may not have the autonomy to make decisions about their own care, leading to poorer health outcomes and decreased quality of life.
