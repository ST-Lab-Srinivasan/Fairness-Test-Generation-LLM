As a beginner Native natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges you may face within the legal system. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Lack of cultural understanding and sensitivity: The legal system can be unfamiliar and intimidating for beginners, especially if they come from a different cultural background. Judges, lawyers, and other legal professionals may not always understand or appreciate the unique cultural perspectives and values of Native American communities, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Many Native American communities face barriers to accessing legal resources, such as limited availability of legal aid services, inadequate funding for legal clinics, and lack of access to technology that can help with legal research. This can make it difficult for beginners to navigate the legal system effectively.
