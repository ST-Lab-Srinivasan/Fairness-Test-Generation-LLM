Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly-beginner Arabic speakers. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences identity formation:

Newly-beginner Arabic speakers learn not only the language but also the cultural practices associated with it, such as food, music, art, and literature.
