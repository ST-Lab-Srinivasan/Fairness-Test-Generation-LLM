2. Limited access to legal resources: Ultra-conservative native people may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal aid services, making it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and assert their rights.
3. Discrimination and bias: Ultra-conservative native people may face discrimination and bias within the legal system, which can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of trust in the system.
4. Difficulty navigating Western legal concepts: Ultra-conservative native people may have difficulty understanding and navigating Western legal concepts, such as the concept of property rights or the rule of law, due to cultural and historical factors.

6. Historical trauma and intergenerational trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to historical trauma and intergenerational trauma among ultra-conservative native communities, which can impact their ability to navigate the legal system and assert their rights.
7. Lack of access to traditional lands and resources: Ultra-conservative native people may have limited access to their traditional lands and resources due to colonization, settlement, and other forms of dispossession, which can impact their ability to practice their culture and traditions.
