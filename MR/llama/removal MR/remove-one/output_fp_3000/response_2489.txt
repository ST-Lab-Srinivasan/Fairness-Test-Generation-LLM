As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect during times of crisis. The recent trends towards excluding certain groups from disaster response efforts are unacceptable and go against the principles of inclusivity and compassion.

To address the needs of not recently non-liberal individuals in disaster response, it is essential to adopt a holistic approach that considers the unique challenges faced by each group. Here are some strategies that can help:
