Ensuring that the educational needs of lower-class adult individuals in their 20s are met requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various factors, including accessibility, affordability, and quality of education. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to education: Lower-class adults may face barriers to accessing educational opportunities due to financial constraints or lack of information about available programs.
