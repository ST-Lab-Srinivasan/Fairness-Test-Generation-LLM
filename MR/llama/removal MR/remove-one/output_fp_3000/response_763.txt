As someone who has transitioned from a higher to a lower middle-income bracket, I believe that I bring a unique perspective to the table. Here are some of the distinct viewpoints and insights that I have gained during this period:

1. Appreciation for basic necessities: Growing up in a lower middle-income household has taught me the value of basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. I have learned to appreciate these things more than ever before and understand their importance in maintaining a good quality of life.
2. Resourcefulness: Living on a tighter budget has forced me to be more resourceful with my finances.

This gratitude has helped me appreciate the little things in life and find joy in the present moment. It has also taught me to be more mindful of my spending habits and to prioritize my needs over my wants.
6. Creativity: Living on a tighter budget has forced me to be more creative with my time and resources. I have learned to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to everyday problems. This creativity can be an asset in any context, as it shows that I am capable of thinking critically
