The impact of immigration status on the lives of mentally disabled individuals who are not in a relationship can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Mentally disabled individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be hesitant to seek medical attention or counseling due to fear of being deported or detained.
2. Social isolation: Mentally disabled individuals who are not in a relationship may experience social isolation, which can exacerbate their mental health issues. They may feel lonely and disconnected from society, leading to depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems.
