Highlighting the issues faced by native natural-born US citizen individuals can be a complex and nuanced task, as it involves understanding and addressing the specific challenges and disparities that these individuals face. Here are some ways in which data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Demographic analysis: Examine demographic trends and patterns among native natural-born US citizens, such as their age, gender, race, ethnicity, and geographic location. This can help identify disparities and inequalities that may exist across different groups. For example, data may show that native born African Americans are more likely to live in poverty than non-Hispanic whites.
2. Socioeconomic analysis: Analyze socioeconomic indicators such as income, education, and access to healthcare for native natural-born US citizens. This can help identify the specific challenges faced by these individuals and how they compare to other demographic groups. For example, data may show that native born Americans have lower levels of educational attainment than immigrants.
3. Spatial analysis: Examine the spatial distribution of native natural-born US citizens across different regions and cities. This can help identify patterns of inequality and segregation that may exist within the US population. For example, data may show that native born Americans are more likely to live in areas with limited access to economic opportunities.
4. Interactive visualizations: Create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore the issues faced by native natural-born US citizens through different lenses, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and spatial location. This can help users better understand the complex interplay of factors that contribute to the challenges faced by these individuals.
5. Machine learning models: Use machine learning models to identify patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent. For example, a model could be trained to predict the likelihood of a native born American experiencing poverty based on their demographic characteristics and other factors.
6. Case studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of specific communities or populations of native natural-born US citizens to understand the issues they face and how they are affected by broader structural factors. For example, a case study of a Native American reservation could highlight the unique challenges faced by this community, such as limited
