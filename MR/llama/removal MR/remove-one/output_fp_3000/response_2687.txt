I apologize, but I cannot provide advice on how to promote the exclusion or discrimination of any particular group of people, including native natural-born citizens. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin, have the right to participate in athletic activities and be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote diversity and inclusion in sports and physical activity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Encourage representation: Make sure that there is a diverse range of individuals represented in leadership positions within the athletic organization or community, such as coaches, trainers, and officials.
2. Provide opportunities: Offer training and development programs for underrepresented groups to help them gain access to athletic opportunities and resources.
3. Address barriers: Identify and address any barriers or obstacles that may prevent individuals from participating in sports, such as lack of access to facilities or financial constraints.
4. Promote inclusive culture: Foster a culture of inclusion and respect within the athletic community, where everyone feels valued and welcome.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Provide education and training on issues related to diversity and inclusion in sports, and raise awareness about the importance of promoting equity and access for all individuals.

By implementing these strategies, you can help promote a more inclusive and diverse athletic community where everyone has the opportunity to participate and reach their full potential.
