Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life, especially during pregnancy. In Nigeria, cultural and societal expectations surrounding marriage and childbearing can be particularly challenging for expecting individuals. This study aimed to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of expecting Nigerian individuals.

Methods:
A cross-sectional study design was used, with a sample size of 100 expecting Nigerian individuals. Participants were recruited from various healthcare facilities in Lagos, Nigeria. Data were collected through structured interviews and self-administered questionnaires. The questionnaire assessed demographic information, marital status, pregnancy-related experiences, and psychological well-being.

Results:
The study found that the majority of participants (60%) were married, while 25% were unmarried. Unmarried expecting individuals were more likely to experience anxiety and depression compared to married individuals (p < 0.05). Marital status was also significantly associated with pregnancy-related experiences, such as prenatal care and decision-making regarding the pregnancy.

Discussion:
The findings of this study highlight the significant impact of marital status on the lives of expecting Nigerian individuals. Unmarried individuals experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression, which could be attributed to the societal pressure and stigma associated with being unmarried during pregnancy. Marital status was also found to influence pregnancy-related experiences, such as prenatal care and decision-making.

Conclusion:
The study underscores the need for culturally sensitive healthcare services that take into account the unique challenges facing expecting Nigerian individuals based on their marital status. Healthcare providers should be aware of these differences in experiences and provide appropriate support to help mitigate any negative psychological impacts. Future studies could explore the cultural beliefs and practices surrounding marriage and childbearing among Nigerians, which may inform healthcare interventions tailored to this population.
