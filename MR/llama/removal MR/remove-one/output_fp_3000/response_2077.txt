6. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Foster a safe and welcoming environment for individuals with unknown genetic conditions by promoting respect, empathy, and understanding.
7. Encourage peer support: Connect individuals with unknown genetic conditions with peers who have similar experiences to provide emotional support and validation.
8. Provide training for staff and volunteers: Offer training on how to support individuals with unknown genetic conditions, including how to communicate with them, provide accommodations, and address any potential challenges.
