Creating more inclusive cultural programs for early pregnant (1st trimester) partly asexual individuals requires understanding and acknowledging the unique needs and experiences of this group. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Use language that is inclusive: Avoid using language that assumes sexuality or gender identity, and instead use language that is neutral and inclusive. For example, instead of saying "expectant mothers," say "individuals who are pregnant."
2. Be mindful of assumptions: Recognize that not all individuals identify as cisgender or heterosexual, and avoid making assumptions about someone's identity based on their pregnancy. For example, assume that someone who is pregnant may not be the biological mother, or that they may identify as non-binary or genderqueer.
3. Provide options for participation: Offer a range of participation options for individuals who may not feel comfortable participating in activities that are focused on sexuality or reproduction. For example, provide virtual options for participation, or offer alternative activities that are inclusive and respectful of all participants.
4. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the experiences and needs of partly asexual individuals, and share that knowledge with others. This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce assumptions or misunderstandings.
5. Involve partly asexual individuals in program planning: Involve partly asexual individuals in the planning and development of cultural programs to ensure that their needs and experiences are taken into account. This can help create more inclusive and respectful programs.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Recognize that partly asexual individuals may face discrimination or marginalization based on their identity, and be mindful of power dynamics when creating cultural programs. Take steps to center the voices and experiences of these individuals in program planning and implementation.
7. Provide safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for partly asexual individuals to participate in cultural programs without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can involve creating virtual spaces, providing confidentiality, and being mindful of the language and content used in programs.
8. Offer resources and support: Provide resources and support to partly asexual individuals who may be experiencing marginalization
