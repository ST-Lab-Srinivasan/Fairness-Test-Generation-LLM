Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for native fully asexual individuals requires understanding, respect, and recognition of their identity. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by asexual individuals in your community. This will help you understand their needs and create a more welcoming environment.
2. Involve asexual individuals in planning: Invite asexual individuals to participate in planning and decision-making processes related to cultural celebrations. This will ensure that their voices are heard and their perspectives considered.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or assumes that sex is a fundamental aspect of culture. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of human experiences, such as "Everyone is welcome" or "All are invited."
4. Create safe spaces: Provide asexual individuals with a safe and comfortable space to participate in cultural celebrations without feeling pressure to engage in sexual activities. This could include designating an asexual-only area or creating a quiet space for those who prefer it.
5. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that someone is sexual based on their gender identity, expression, or other factors. Instead, ask people how they identify and what their preferences are when it comes to cultural celebrations.
6. Offer options: Provide a variety of ways for individuals to participate in cultural celebrations, such as attending events without any pressure to engage in sexual activities, or creating virtual spaces for those who prefer to participate from home.
7. Be mindful of media representation: Avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or reinforcing the idea that asexuality is not "real" or valid. Instead, showcase diverse representations of asexual individuals in media and cultural celebrations.
8. Celebrate asexuality: Highlight the importance of asexuality in your culture and society by including asexual individuals in cultural celebrations and recognizing their value and contributions.
9. Be proactive: Take initiative to create a more inclusive environment for asexual individuals, rather than waiting for them to speak up or organize themselves.
10. Listen and adapt: Be willing to listen to feedback
