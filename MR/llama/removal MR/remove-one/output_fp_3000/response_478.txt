To ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born US citizen people are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Strengthening the healthcare workforce: The US should invest in training and retaining healthcare professionals, particularly in underserved areas. This can be done by increasing funding for medical education and residency programs, as well as providing financial incentives for healthcare providers to practice in these areas.
2. Improving access to care: The US should work to increase access to healthcare for all citizens, particularly those living in rural or underserved areas. This can be achieved by expanding the reach of community health centers and other safety-net providers, and by increasing funding for these programs.
3. Addressing disparities in health outcomes: The US should work to address disparities in health outcomes between different populations, such as racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in poverty. This can be done by investing in culturally competent care and addressing systemic barriers to care.
4. Promoting prevention and public health: The US should prioritize prevention and public health efforts, such as immunization programs, cancer screenings, and other population-based interventions. This can help to reduce the burden on the healthcare system and improve overall health outcomes.
5. Ensuring affordability: The US should work to ensure that healthcare is affordable for all citizens, particularly those with low incomes or limited financial resources. This can be achieved by expanding Medicaid and other safety-net programs, and by implementing cost-containment measures such as value-based payment models.
6. Encouraging innovation: The US should encourage innovation in healthcare, particularly in areas such as telehealth and personalized medicine. This can help to improve access to care and make healthcare more efficient and effective.
7. Addressing the social determinants of health: The US should recognize that health is influenced by a range of social factors, such as housing, transportation, and food security. By addressing these social determinants of health, the US can help to improve overall health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
8. Supporting community health workers: The US should invest in
