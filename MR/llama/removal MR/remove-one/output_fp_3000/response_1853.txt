Recently reservist individuals face a unique set of challenges in the job market, including:

1. Lack of continuous work experience: Reservists often return to civilian life after an extended period of service, which can make it difficult for them to transition back into the workforce. Their lack of continuous work experience can lead to gaps in their employment history and a less competitive edge in the job market.
