The challenges faced by deeply lower-class cisgender elderly people in the healthcare system are numerous and complex. Here are some of the issues they may encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Deeply lower-class elderly individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints or lack of transportation. They may have to wait longer for appointments or procedures, which can worsen their health outcomes.
2. Discrimination and stigma: Elderly people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may experience discrimination and stigma in the healthcare system, which can affect their mental and emotional well-being. They may feel marginalized or ignored by healthcare providers who are not attuned to their cultural backgrounds or experiences.
3. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may lack understanding of the cultural practices and beliefs of deeply lower-class elderly individuals, leading to miscommunication or misunderstandings that can compromise their care.
4. Lack of social support: Elderly people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have fewer social connections and support networks, which can make it harder for them to access healthcare services or receive adequate care when they need it.
5. Health literacy challenges: Deeply lower-class elderly individuals may face challenges in understanding and navigating the complex healthcare system, due to limited education or cognitive impairment.
6. Limited English proficiency: Elderly people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who are not fluent in the dominant language of their region may face barriers to accessing healthcare services, particularly if they do not have access to interpreters or translators.
7. Chronic conditions and co-morbidities: Deeply lower-class elderly individuals may be more likely to experience chronic conditions and co-morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and dementia, which can be difficult to manage without adequate access to healthcare services.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Elderly people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have limited access to specialized care, such as cancer treatment or cardiology services, due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area.
