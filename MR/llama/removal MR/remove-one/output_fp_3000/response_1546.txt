Advocating for the rights of natural-born citizens who are also reservists can be challenging, but there have been several successful efforts throughout history. Here are some examples:

1. The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956): In response to racial segregation on public buses in Montgomery, Alabama, African American reservists organized a successful boycott of the bus system. Led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the boycott lasted for 381 days and resulted in the desegregation of the city's buses.
2. The Civil Rights Act of 1964: This landmark legislation prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It also established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to investigate claims of discrimination in the workplace.
3. The Voting Rights Act of 1965: This act prohibited states from imposing voting qualifications or prerequisites that would deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race or color. It also established a federal oversight mechanism to ensure compliance with the act.
4. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990: This legislation prohibited discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodations, and telecommunications. It also established the ADA National Network to provide technical assistance and support to businesses and organizations.
5. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009: Named after a reservist who fought against gender-based wage discrimination, this act makes it easier for workers to bring pay discrimination claims in federal court. It also established the National Women's History Project to promote awareness and appreciation of women's contributions to American history.
6. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) of 2003: This act provides legal protections for reservists, including the right to delay or terminate certain civil obligations during deployment.
