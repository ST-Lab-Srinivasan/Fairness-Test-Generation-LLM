Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently arrived English language learners. It can influence their sense of belonging, self-esteem, and overall well-being. Here are some ways cultural heritage can impact newly arrived English speakers:

1. Sense of Belonging: Cultural heritage can help individuals feel a sense of belonging in their new environment. For example, if they have moved to a country with a similar cultural background, they may feel more comfortable and at ease.
