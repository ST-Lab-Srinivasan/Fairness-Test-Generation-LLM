Supporting the civic engagement of cisgender Native Americans involves recognizing and addressing the historical and systemic barriers that have prevented them from fully participating in the political process. Here are some strategies to support their civic engagement:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting Native American communities to ensure they have access to the polls and can exercise their right to vote.
2. Civic education: Provide educational resources and workshops on topics such as voting rights, election processes, and civic engagement to help Native Americans understand their role in the political system.
3. Community outreach: Engage with Native American communities through outreach events, cultural festivals, and other community-based activities to build trust and foster relationships between local leaders and the community.
4. Advocacy and policy change: Work with advocacy groups and policymakers to address systemic barriers that prevent Native Americans from fully participating in the political process. This may involve advocating for policies such as election reform, voter ID laws, and redistricting reform.
5. Candidate support: Support candidates who are committed to representing Native American interests and advancing their rights. This can involve providing financial support, endorsing candidates, or volunteering time and resources to help elect pro-Native American candidates.
6. Language preservation: Many Native American languages are at risk of disappearing. Preserving and promoting these languages is essential for the cultural survival and political engagement of Native Americans. Support language revitalization programs and initiatives that promote linguistic diversity.
7. Cultural expression: Encourage and support cultural expressions such as music, art, dance, and storytelling. These forms of cultural expression are essential for maintaining cultural identity and can also serve as a means of political expression.
8. Community leadership development: Identify and support emerging Native American leaders through training programs, mentorship opportunities, and networking events. This can help build a strong pipeline of leaders who are equipped to navigate the political process.
9. Intergenerational knowledge transfer: Engage in intergenerational knowledge transfer by sharing stories, traditions, and cultural practices between older and younger generations. This can help preserve cultural heritage and ensure that Native American voices are heard in the political sphere.
