Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of Nigerian people, both positively and negatively. Here are some of the potential effects:

Positive impacts:

1. Access to better economic opportunities: Many Nigerians migrate to other countries in search of better job opportunities, higher wages, and improved living standards. Having a valid immigration status can provide access to these opportunities, allowing them to support themselves and their families.
2. Improved healthcare access: In some countries, undocumented immigrants may have limited access to healthcare services. Obtaining legal immigration status can provide better access to healthcare facilities, including preventive care, emergency services, and medical treatment.
3. Social integration: Legal immigration status can facilitate social integration into the host society. Nigerians with legal immigration status may find it easier to make friends, build relationships, and participate in community activities.
4. Political rights: In some countries, citizenship and immigration status are linked. Obtaining legal immigration status can provide access to political rights, such as voting, running for public office, and participating in civic engagement.

Negative impacts:

1. Discrimination and stigma: Undocumented immigrants may face discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status. This can lead to social isolation, lower self-esteem, and mental health issues.
2. Limited access to education: In some countries, undocumented immigrants may have limited access to educational institutions. Legal immigration status can provide access to higher education and vocational training.
3. Detention and deportation: Undocumented immigrants are at risk of detention and deportation if they are caught by authorities. This can result in separation from family members, lost income, and emotional distress.
4. Financial burdens: The process of obtaining legal immigration status can be costly, including fees for legal representation, documentation, and travel expenses. This can create financial burdens for Nigerians who may already be struggling to make ends meet.
5. Dependence on sponsors: In some cases, Nigerians may rely on sponsors or employers to obtain immigration status. This can lead to exploitation and abuse,
