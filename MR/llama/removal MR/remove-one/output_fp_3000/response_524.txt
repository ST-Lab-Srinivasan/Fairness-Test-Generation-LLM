Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for partially identifying as partly asexual individuals requires understanding, empathy, and active steps towards creating a welcoming environment. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community, their experiences, and the challenges they face. This will help you understand their needs and create inclusive celebrations.
2. Involve asexual individuals in planning: Consult with asexual individuals to get their perspective on how to make the celebration more inclusive. Their input can help ensure that your efforts are genuine and effective.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or expects them to be interested in romantic or sexual relationships. Instead, use language that acknowledges and respects people's individual identities.
4. Provide options for non-romantic/non-sexual activities: Offer a range of activities that are not centered around romance or sex, such as game nights, movie marathons, or volunteer opportunities. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity for asexual individuals.
5. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume someone's sexual identity based on their gender expression or presentation. Allow people to self-identify and respect their identity.
6. Be mindful of representation: Ensure that the celebration includes representation of asexual identities, either through art, music, or other forms of expression. This can help create a sense of visibility and inclusion.
7. Create safe spaces: Designate areas where asexual individuals can feel safe and comfortable without pressure to engage in romantic or sexual activities.
8. Be aware of power dynamics: Be mindful of the privilege and power dynamics at play during cultural celebrations, especially those centered around romance and sex. Avoid perpetuating harmful attitudes or behaviors that might alienate asexual individuals.
9. Engage in active listening: Listen to the concerns and suggestions of asexual individuals and make adjustments accordingly. This can help build trust and create a more inclusive environment.
10. Be open to feedback: Encourage asexual individuals to share their thoughts and feelings about the celebration, and be willing to adapt and improve based on their input.
