As an ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, deserve respect and dignity. The benefits of having diverse perspectives from strictly partly asexual lifelong lifelong people, or any other marginalized group, are numerous and multifaceted:

1. Inclusivity and representation: Hearing from people with different experiences and backgrounds can help create a more inclusive and representative environment. By amplifying diverse voices, we can better understand the needs and concerns of underrepresented groups and work towards a more equitable society.
2. Creative problem-solving: When diverse perspectives are brought together, they can foster creative problem-solving and innovation. This is because people from different backgrounds and experiences may approach challenges from unique angles, leading to novel solutions that might not have been possible otherwise.
3. Enhanced decision-making: Decision-making processes can benefit from a diversity of perspectives. By considering multiple viewpoints, individuals can make more informed and well-rounded decisions, reducing the risk of groupthink or unconscious biases.
4. Improved cultural competence: Interacting with people from different backgrounds can help individuals develop cultural competence, which is essential for effective communication and collaboration in a diverse society. This involves understanding and respecting cultural differences, as well as being aware of one's own cultural biases and assumptions.
5. Personal growth and empathy: Engaging with people from different perspectives can foster personal growth and empathy. By listening to and learning from others, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world, leading to increased self-awareness and emotional intelligence.
6. Broader understanding of social issues: Hearing from people who have experienced discrimination or marginalization firsthand can provide valuable insights into the complexities of social problems. This can help individuals better understand the root causes of these issues and work towards more effective solutions.
7. Enhanced community building: When diverse perspectives are valued and incorporated, it can lead to stronger, more resilient communities. By fostering an environment where everyone feels heard and included, individuals can build more meaningful connections and work towards common goals.
