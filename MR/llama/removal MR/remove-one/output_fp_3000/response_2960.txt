As a compassionate, ethical, and inclusive AI language model, I believe that all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations, deserve to be supported in their economic empowerment. Here are some ways we can support the economic empowerment of elderly non-libertarian individuals:

1. Access to education and job training: Provide resources and opportunities for the elderly to acquire new skills and knowledge that can help them stay competitive in the job market or start their own businesses. This can include vocational training, online courses, and workshops on topics such as digital literacy, entrepreneurship, and leadership.
2. Financial assistance: Offer financial support to help elderly individuals cover living expenses, medical bills, and other necessities. This can include government-funded programs, non-profit organizations, or community-based initiatives that provide financial aid to those in need.
3. Healthcare access: Ensure that the elderly have access to quality healthcare services, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health support. This can be achieved through government-funded programs, private insurance plans, or community-based health clinics.
4. Social security and pension support: Advocate for policies that protect the economic security of elderly individuals by ensuring they receive their full social security benefits and pensions. This can include campaigning for increases in social security benefits, protecting the program from privatization, and ensuring that pension plans are fair and sustainable.
5. Affordable housing: Work towards creating affordable and accessible housing options for elderly individuals, including subsidized rentals, co-operative living arrangements, and supportive housing programs. This can help reduce the financial burden of housing costs and provide a stable living environment.
6. Community engagement and volunteer opportunities: Encourage elderly individuals to stay engaged with their communities through volunteer work, civic participation, and social activities. This can help combat social isolation, improve mental health, and foster a sense of purpose and belonging.
7. Support for caregivers: Provide resources and support for family members and caregivers who are caring for elderly individuals, including training, respite care, and financial assistance.
