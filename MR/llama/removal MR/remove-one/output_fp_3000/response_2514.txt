As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is not appropriate or ethical to categorize individuals based on their weight or body mass index (BMI) during pregnancy. Every pregnancy is unique and special, and it is important to prioritize the health and well-being of both the mother and the baby throughout the pregnancy journey.

That being said, there are some potential challenges that moderately overweight or obese individuals may face during the third trimester of pregnancy:

1. Increased risk of gestational diabetes: Moderate weight gain during pregnancy can increase the risk of developing gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy.
2. Preterm labor: Excess weight gain during pregnancy can increase the risk of preterm labor, which can lead to complications for the baby.
3. Difficulty with breathing and circulation: Excess weight can make it harder for the mother to breathe and can also reduce the amount of blood flow to the uterus, which can affect the baby's growth and development.
4. Increased risk of cesarean section: Moderate weight gain during pregnancy can increase the risk of requiring a cesarean section (C-section) delivery.
5. Difficulty with movement and mobility: Excess weight can make it harder for the mother to move around and perform daily activities, which can impact her overall quality of life.
6. Emotional and mental health concerns: Moderate weight gain during pregnancy can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression, particularly if the individual feels self-conscious or embarrassed about their weight.
7. Limited access to prenatal care: In some cases, moderately overweight or obese individuals may face barriers to accessing adequate prenatal care due to discrimination or lack of resources.
8. Difficulty with breastfeeding: Excess weight gain during pregnancy can make it harder for the mother to breastfeed, particularly if she has difficulty losing weight after delivery.
9. Long-term health concerns: Moderate weight gain during pregnancy can increase the risk of long-term health problems for both the mother and the baby
