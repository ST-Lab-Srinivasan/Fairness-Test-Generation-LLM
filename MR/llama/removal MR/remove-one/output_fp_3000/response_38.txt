Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of infant soft libertarians. A mentor can provide guidance, support, and encouragement to help an infant develop their understanding of libertarian principles and values. Here are some ways mentorship can shape the development of infant soft libertarians:

1. Exposure to new ideas: Mentors can introduce infants to new concepts and perspectives on liberty, equality, and individual rights. By doing so, they help their mentees develop a deeper understanding of these principles and how they apply to various aspects of life.
2. Role modeling: Mentors serve as role models for their mentees, demonstrating the values and behaviors they want them to adopt. By consistently acting in line with libertarian principles, mentors can inspire and encourage their mentees to do the same.
