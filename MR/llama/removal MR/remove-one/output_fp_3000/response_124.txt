There are several challenges that late 30-something Native Americans may face in the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained in the unique cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis.
2. Language barriers: Many Native American communities have their own languages, and healthcare providers may not speak these languages, making communication difficult.
3. Limited access to care: Native Americans may live in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities, or they may face financial barriers to accessing care.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has had a profound impact on the physical and mental health of Native American communities. This historical trauma can lead to ongoing stress and mental health challenges.
5. Stigma around seeking care: Some Native Americans may be hesitant to seek medical care due to cultural beliefs or fear of being stigmatized for seeking help.
6. Limited healthcare provider diversity: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of Native American communities, leading to a lack of culturally competent providers.
7. Lack of traditional healing practices integration: Many Native Americans may prefer to incorporate traditional healing practices into their healthcare, but this is often not possible due to the dominant Western medical model.
8. Limited mental health resources: Mental health resources, such as counseling and therapy, may be limited in rural areas, and there may be a shortage of culturally competent providers.
9. Chronic diseases prevalence: Native American communities are disproportionately affected by chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems, due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
10. Health disparities: Native Americans experience higher rates of mortality and morbidity compared to the general population, particularly for chronic diseases and mental health conditions.

Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive approach that includes cultural competency training for healthcare providers, increased access to care in rural areas, and the integration of traditional healing practices into the healthcare system. Additionally, addressing the historical trauma faced
