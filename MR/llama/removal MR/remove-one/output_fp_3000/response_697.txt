As a public speaker and communication expert, I believe there are several legislative changes that could benefit beginner speaker civilian communities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Tax Incentives for Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs: Many beginner speakers start their careers as small business owners or entrepreneurs. Providing tax incentives for these individuals can help them invest more in their speaking businesses, which could lead to increased job creation and economic growth.
2. Access to Affordable Training and Education: Beginner speakers often face challenges in accessing affordable training and education programs that can help them improve their speaking skills. Governments can provide subsidies or grants for these programs, making it easier for speakers to invest in their own professional development.
3. Streamlined Licensing Processes: Obtaining the necessary licenses and permits to operate a speaking business can be a time-consuming and costly process. Governments can simplify these processes by providing online portals, reducing fees, and offering assistance to help speakers navigate the bureaucracy more efficiently.
4. Protection of Intellectual Property: Beginner speakers often rely on original content and intellectual property to build their businesses. Governments can provide legal protection for these assets by implementing stronger copyright laws and enforcement mechanisms.
5. Increased Access to Financing Options: Many beginner speakers struggle to secure funding for their businesses, particularly in the early stages. Governments can encourage financial institutions to offer more financing options for speaking businesses, such as loans, grants, or investment opportunities.
6. Promotion of Diversity and Inclusion: The speaking industry has historically been dominated by white males. Governments can promote diversity and inclusion by providing resources and support for underrepresented groups, such as women, people of color, and individuals with disabilities.
7. Regulation of Speaking Industry: While a light touch regulatory approach is generally preferred, there are some areas where government regulation can help protect beginner speakers from unethical practices or exploitation. For example, laws related to labor standards, contractual agreements, and consumer protection can help ensure that beginners are treated fairly and have access to the resources they need to succeed.
8. Encouragement of Community Engagement:
