Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Beginner Speaker Late 30s People

Introduction:
Politics can have a profound impact on an individual's life, especially during times of great social and political change. As a beginner speaker in their late 30s, the influence of political affiliation can be even more significant, as it can affect various aspects of their personal and professional life. This research aims to explore the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner speakers in their late 30s, including their social interactions, career opportunities, and overall well-being.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that political affiliation can shape an individual's identity and influence their decision-making processes (Hetherington & Weiler, 2009). Political affiliation can also affect interpersonal relationships, as individuals may form social networks based on shared political beliefs (Budasoff, 2017). Additionally, research has shown that political affiliation can impact career opportunities, as individuals with certain political views may face discrimination or bias in the workplace (Miller, 2019).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of beginner speakers in their late 30s, asking questions about their political affiliation, social interactions, career opportunities, and overall well-being. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted with a subset of participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences.

Significance:
This study will contribute to the existing literature on the impact of political affiliation on individual lives. By examining the experiences of beginner speakers in their late 30s, this research will provide valuable insights into how political affiliation affects different aspects of their personal and professional life. The findings will also have practical implications for individuals who are navigating their careers and social relationships while also managing their political beliefs.
