Family support plays a significant role in the success of deeply lower-class devout people. Lower-class individuals who are deeply devoted to their religion often face numerous barriers to success, including discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and financial difficulties. However, with the support of their families, they are able to overcome these challenges and achieve their goals.

Family support can take many forms, including:

1. Emotional Support: Deeply lower-class devout people often face discrimination and marginalization, which can lead to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem. Their families can provide emotional support by offering a listening ear, encouragement, and validation of their beliefs.
2. Financial Support: Lower-class individuals may struggle to make ends meet, and their families can help them financially by providing financial assistance, sharing resources, or helping them find job opportunities.
3. Practical Support: Families can provide practical support by helping their members with daily tasks, such as childcare, household chores, and transportation. This can free up time and energy for the deeply devout individual to focus on their religious practices and goals.
4. Networking: Family members can help their deeply lower-class devout loved ones connect with other people in their community who share similar beliefs and values. This can provide a sense of belonging and support, which is essential for overcoming the challenges of being deeply lower-class and devout.
5. Role Modeling: Family members who are deeply devoted to their religion can serve as role models for their loved ones. By living out their faith in their daily lives, they can inspire and motivate their family members to do the same.

In conclusion, family support plays a crucial role in the success of deeply lower-class devout people. By providing emotional, financial, practical, networking, and role modeling support, families can help their loved ones overcome the challenges they face and achieve their goals.
