Introduction:
Marriage and mental health have long been intertwined, with research suggesting that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on mental health outcomes. In France, where the majority of the population is mentally able-bodied, the impacts of marital status on mental health may differ from those in other countries or populations. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of mentally able-bodied native French speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on mental health outcomes, depending on factors such as the quality of the relationship, social support, and levels of stress. For example, married individuals may experience higher levels of social support and lower levels of stress compared to unmarried individuals, which can positively impact their mental health. However, marriage can also lead to increased levels of stress and pressure to conform to societal expectations, particularly for women.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of mentally able-bodied native French speaker individuals, inquiring about their marital status, social support networks, and mental health outcomes. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the impacts of marital status on their lives.

Results:
The survey results indicate that mentally able-bodied native French speaker individuals who are married tend to have higher levels of social support and lower levels of stress compared to those who are unmarried. However, the in-depth interviews reveal a more complex picture, with some participants expressing feelings of isolation and disconnection from their spouse, particularly if they have children.

Conclusion:
While marriage may positively impact mental health outcomes for mentally able-bodied native French speaker individuals in terms of social support and reduced stress levels, it can also lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from one's spouse. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential impacts of marital status on mental health outcomes in this population, and to provide appropriate support and resources for those who may be experiencing negative consequences of marriage.
