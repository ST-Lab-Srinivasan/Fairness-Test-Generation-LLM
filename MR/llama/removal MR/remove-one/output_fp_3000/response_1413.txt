As a hardcore socialist early-transition person, cultural heritage plays a significant role in my life. I believe that cultural heritage is not just about preserving the past, but also about shaping the present and future. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences my beliefs and actions:

1. Challenging dominant narratives: As a socialist, I am committed to challenging the dominant narratives that have been imposed upon us by capitalist societies.

4. Fostering solidarity: Cultural heritage can help foster solidarity among people by promoting a sense of shared identity and belonging. For example, the cultural heritage of immigrant communities can help to build bridges between different groups and promote a sense of mutual respect and understanding.

Cultural heritage can help me achieve this goal by providing a rich source of inspiration and creative expression. For example, traditional crafts and art forms can be adapted and transformed into new and innovative works that reflect the values and aspirations of socialism.
