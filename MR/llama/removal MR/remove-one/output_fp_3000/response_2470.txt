Creating more inclusive cultural programs for pregnant individuals in their first trimester requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural program is accessible to all, including those who may be experiencing morning sickness or other symptoms of early pregnancy. Provide comfortable seating and adequate spacing to allow for movement and stretching.
2. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as extra seating or designated areas for resting during the program. This can help alleviate discomfort and ensure that everyone feels included.
3. Education: Provide education on pregnancy and childbirth, including information on prenatal care, nutrition, and exercise. This can help empower individuals and give them a sense of control over their health and well-being during this time.
4. Supportive environment: Create a supportive environment by providing a safe space for individuals to share their experiences and feelings without fear of judgment. Encourage open communication and empathy towards one another.
5. Partnership with healthcare providers: Collaborate with healthcare providers to offer on-site services such as prenatal check-ups, nutrition counseling, or even childbirth education classes. This can help individuals feel more supported and informed throughout their pregnancy.
6. Inclusive marketing: Ensure that marketing materials are inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their pregnancy status. Use language and imagery that is respectful and inclusive, and avoid making assumptions about someone's identity based on their appearance.
7. Safe space: Create a safe space for individuals to share their experiences and feelings without fear of judgment. Encourage open communication and empathy towards one another.
8. Flexibility: Be flexible in your programming, recognizing that everyone's pregnancy journey is unique and may require different accommodations. Be willing to adapt and make changes as needed to ensure that all individuals feel included and supported.
9. Involvement of marginalized groups: Ensure that the cultural program involves and caters to the specific needs and experiences of marginalized groups, such as individuals from low-income communities, racial and ethnic minorities,
