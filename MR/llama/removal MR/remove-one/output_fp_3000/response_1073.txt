Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full devout Muslim individuals. Islam is not just a religion, but a way of life that encompasses various aspects of an individual's identity, including their cultural practices and beliefs. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of ethnically full devout Muslim individuals:

1. Cultural Practices: Ethnic minority Muslims often maintain unique cultural practices that are distinct from the dominant culture of their adopted country. These practices, such as traditional clothing, food, music, and dance, help them preserve their cultural identity while still adhering to their Islamic beliefs. For example, Bosnian Muslims may celebrate Eid-al-Fitr with traditional dishes like baklava and cevapi, while Somali Muslims may observe the Islamic holiday of Eid-al-Adha by sacrificing sheep and sharing meals with family and community members.
2. Language: Many ethnic minority Muslims speak languages that are not the dominant language of their adopted country. For example, Turkish Muslims in Germany may speak Turkish at home and in their communities, while Arabic is spoken in many Arab American communities in the United States. Preserving their native language helps individuals maintain their cultural identity and connect with their heritage.
3. Religion and Spirituality: Islam provides a spiritual framework for ethnically full devout Muslims to navigate their identities within diverse societies. However, their cultural heritage may also influence their religious practices and beliefs. For example, South Asian Muslims may observe more rituals and practices related to Hinduism than those observed by other Muslim groups, reflecting the blending of Islamic and Hindu traditions in their cultural heritage.
4. Community and Belonging: Ethnic minority Muslims often find a sense of belonging within their own ethnic communities, where they can share cultural practices and maintain social connections with others who understand their experiences. This sense of community helps individuals navigate the challenges of living in a dominant culture that may not always accept or appreciate their identity.
5. Resistance and Empowerment: Ethnically full devout Muslims may use their cultural heritage as a means of resistance against systemic oppression, such as racism or discrimination
