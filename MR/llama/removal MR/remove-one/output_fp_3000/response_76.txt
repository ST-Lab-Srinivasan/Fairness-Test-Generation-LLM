Creating more inclusive social policies for blue-collar ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the contributions of blue-collar workers: Blue-collar workers are often overlooked and undervalued in society. By recognizing their contributions to the economy and society, we can start to level the playing field and provide them with the respect and support they deserve.
