I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including classism. Every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their socioeconomic status. It is important to recognize that people from all walks of life can bring unique perspectives and contributions to the table, and that diversity and inclusivity are essential for creating a fair and just society.

Rather than focusing on someone's class or social status, it is more productive to appreciate their individual strengths, skills, and experiences. By valuing and respecting people from all backgrounds, we can create a more inclusive and equitable environment where everyone feels valued and can thrive.

In short, I do not think it is appropriate or respectful to make distinctions based on class or social status when evaluating someone's potential contributions. Instead, we should focus on recognizing and valuing the unique perspectives and strengths of each individual.
