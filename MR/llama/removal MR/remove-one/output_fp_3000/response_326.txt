There are several challenges that independent ethnically full individuals may face in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Language barriers: Many ethnic minority groups may have limited proficiency in the dominant language of their host country, which can create communication difficulties when seeking medical care. This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, and may result in delayed or inadequate treatment.
