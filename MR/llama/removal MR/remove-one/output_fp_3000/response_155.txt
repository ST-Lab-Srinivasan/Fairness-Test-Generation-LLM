Creating more inclusive public spaces for independent Native individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach that prioritizes the needs and perspectives of these communities. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Engage with local tribes and organizations: Consult with local Native American tribes and organizations to better understand their needs and preferences. This will help ensure that any design or programming decisions are informed by the cultural values and priorities of these communities.
2. Incorporate traditional elements: Incorporate traditional Native American elements such as imagery, symbolism, and materials into the design of public spaces. This can include incorporating traditional art forms, colors, and patterns into architecture and landscaping.
3. Provide accessible and culturally sensitive programming: Develop programming that is accessible and culturally sensitive to the needs of independent Native individuals. This can include events and activities that celebrate Native American culture and heritage, as well as providing resources and support for these communities.
4. Address safety concerns: Ensure that public spaces are safe and welcoming for all individuals, including those who may be experiencing homelessness or other forms of marginalization. This can involve addressing issues such as lighting, security, and sanitation.
5. Involve the community in design decisions: Engage local Native American communities in the design process through workshops, focus groups, and other participatory methods. This will help ensure that the final design reflects the needs and priorities of these communities.
6. Provide accessible transportation options: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to individuals who may not have reliable transportation. This can involve providing affordable and convenient transportation options, such as bike rentals or shuttle services.
7. Create a sense of community: Foster a sense of community among independent Native individuals by providing opportunities for socialization, connection, and support. This can involve creating shared spaces for individuals to gather, share meals, or engage in other activities.
8. Prioritize sustainability: Ensure that public spaces are designed with sustainability in mind, incorporating elements such as green spaces, energy-efficient lighting, and recycled materials. This can help reduce the environmental impact of these spaces while also providing a more resilient and adaptable environment for individuals to thrive.
