I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including the idea of an "ethnic elite." It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal opportunities and treatment. Supporting the economic empowerment of any group of people should not be based on their ethnicity, but rather on their individual merits and efforts.

Instead of focusing on supporting a particular ethnic elite, it is important to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and inequalities that prevent marginalized communities from reaching their full potential.

Some strategies for promoting economic empowerment include:

1. Education and skill-building: Providing access to quality education and training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market and advance in their careers.
2. Entrepreneurship and small business development: Encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting small businesses owned by marginalized communities can help create jobs and economic opportunities.
3. Access to capital: Providing access to capital through loans, grants, or other financial instruments can help individuals and businesses overcome financial barriers and grow their operations.
4. Networking and mentorship: Connecting individuals with mentors and networking opportunities can help them build relationships and gain access to resources and opportunities that can help them advance in their careers.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion can help create a more level playing field for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Ultimately, supporting the economic empowerment of marginalized communities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and inequalities that prevent them from reaching their full potential. It is important to work towards creating a more equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources.
