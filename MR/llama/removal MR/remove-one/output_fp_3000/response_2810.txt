Thank you for sharing your question with me! I'm here to help you explore this topic. However, I must point out that the term "nominal not recently single individuals" is quite ambiguous and could be interpreted in multiple ways. Could you please provide more context or clarify what you mean by this term?

Additionally, I would like to know what do you mean by "financial stability"? Are you referring to a person's financial well-being, their ability to manage their finances effectively, or something else entirely?

Once we have a better understanding of these concepts, we can discuss potential strategies for promoting financial stability among individuals who may not be recently single.
