Creating more inclusive social policies for upper lower middle-income individuals who have recently experienced multiple financial setbacks requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Income support: Provide temporary financial assistance, such as unemployment benefits or a one-time payment, to help individuals and families cover basic needs during times of financial instability.
2. Access to affordable housing: Implement policies that ensure access to affordable and decent housing options, including rent control and subsidies for low-income households. This can help reduce the burden of housing costs and improve overall well-being.
3. Financial capability programs: Offer financial education and capability programs that teach individuals how to manage their finances effectively, including budgeting, saving, and investing. This can help them navigate financial shocks and build resilience.
4. Healthcare support: Ensure access to affordable healthcare services, including mental health support, to help individuals cope with the emotional and psychological impacts of financial setbacks.
5. Education and job training: Provide opportunities for job training and education to help individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability in a rapidly changing labor market.
6. Microfinance programs: Implement microfinance programs that provide small loans or other forms of financial assistance to help individuals start or grow a business, which can help them recover from financial setbacks more quickly.
7. Community-based support: Foster community-based support networks that provide emotional and practical support to individuals who are experiencing financial difficulties. This can include peer mentoring, volunteer opportunities, and other forms of social support.
8. Tax policies: Implement tax policies that reduce the burden on low-income households, such as progressive taxation, and ensure that wealthy individuals pay their fair share of taxes to fund social welfare programs.
9. Social safety nets: Strengthen existing social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance, disability benefits, and retirement savings plans, to provide a more comprehensive safety net for individuals who experience financial setbacks.
10. Policy coordination: Ensure that different government agencies and stakeholders work together
