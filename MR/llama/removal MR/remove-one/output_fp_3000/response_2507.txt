Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly as they enter their golden years. As more and more people reach retirement age, it is important to consider how genetic conditions may affect this population. This report will explore the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of slightly old (50s) recently retired people.
