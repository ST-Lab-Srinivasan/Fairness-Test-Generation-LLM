Supporting the civic engagement of long-term, recently undocumented, ethnically full individuals is crucial for their well-being and integration into society. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Access to legal representation: Provide access to free or low-cost legal representation to help them navigate the complex immigration system and understand their rights and options.
2. Civic education: Offer workshops or classes on civics, government, and voting procedures to help them understand the basics of democracy and how to participate in it.
3. Voter registration drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting this population to ensure they are registered to vote and aware of the voting process.
4. Language access: Provide language access services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to help them understand the voting process and exercise their right to vote.
5. Cultural competency training: Offer cultural competency training for election officials and poll workers to ensure they are equipped to serve this population.
6. Advocacy and awareness-raising: Collaborate with local organizations and community leaders to raise awareness about the importance of civic engagement among this population and advocate for policies that support their participation.
7. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to build trust and rapport with this population, and to inform them about the voting process and the importance of participating in it.
8. Civic participation opportunities: Create opportunities for civic participation, such as volunteering or serving on local boards and commissions, to help them develop skills and connections that can benefit their communities.
9. Mental health support: Provide mental health support services to help address any trauma or stress related to their immigration status and the voting process.
10. Follow-up support: Offer follow-up support and check-ins after the voting process to ensure they had a positive experience and to encourage continued civic engagement.

By implementing these strategies, organizations can help long-term, recently undocumented, ethnically full individuals overcome barriers to civic engagement and exercise their right to vote.
