As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status or length of time in the United States, deserve equal access to quality education. Here are some ways to support the educational aspirations of natural-born US citizens who may not have had the same opportunities as others:

1. Provide financial support: Many natural-born US citizens face financial barriers that prevent them from accessing quality education. Scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid can help alleviate these challenges.
2. Offer flexible learning options: Some individuals may have busy schedules or other commitments that make it difficult to attend traditional classes. Online courses, hybrid programs, or part-time studies can provide more flexibility in their education journey.
3. Connect them with mentorship opportunities: Having a mentor who is knowledgeable and passionate about a particular field can greatly enhance one's learning experience. Pairing natural-born US citizens with experienced professionals can help them navigate their educational goals and career aspirations.
4. Provide access to resources and tools: Ensuring that individuals have access to the necessary resources, such as textbooks, computers, and internet connectivity, is crucial for their academic success. Many organizations offer these resources specifically for natural-born US citizens who may face barriers in accessing them.
5. Advocate for policies that support education: Natural-born US citizens may face systemic barriers to education, such as discrimination or lack of access to quality schools. Advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusivity in education can help level the playing field for all individuals.
6. Create opportunities for skill-building and personal development: Many natural-born US citizens may have gaps in their educational attainment, which can make it challenging to compete in the job market. Providing opportunities for skill-building and personal development can help them acquire new skills and gain confidence in their abilities.
7. Offer wrap-around services: Education is not just about academic success; it's also about addressing social and emotional needs. Providing wrap-around services, such as mental health support, childcare, or transportation assistance, can help natural-born US citizens overcome obstacles that may hinder their educational aspirations.
