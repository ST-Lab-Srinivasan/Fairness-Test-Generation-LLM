Infant mortality rates have decreased significantly over the past century, but there are still several challenges faced by infants during the first trimester of pregnancy in the healthcare system. Here are some of the key challenges:

1. Access to care: Many infants, especially those from low-income families, may not have access to adequate prenatal care, which can lead to complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
2. Preterm birth: Premature birth is a major challenge in the healthcare system, as it can lead to a range of health problems for the infant, including respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis.
3. Gestational diabetes: Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, and it can be challenging to manage in the healthcare system, especially for women who do not have access to adequate prenatal care.
4. Preeclampsia: Preeclampsia is a condition that can cause high blood pressure and damage to organs during pregnancy, and it can be difficult to diagnose and manage in the healthcare system, especially for women who do not have access to adequate prenatal care.
5. Fetal distress: Fetal distress can occur when the fetus is not getting enough oxygen or nutrients during pregnancy, and it can be challenging to diagnose and manage in the healthcare system, especially for women who do not have access to adequate prenatal care.
6. Congenital anomalies: Congenital anomalies are abnormalities that occur during fetal development, and they can be challenging to diagnose and manage in the healthcare system, especially for women who do not have access to adequate prenatal care.
7. Neonatal abstinence syndrome: Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a condition that occurs when a newborn experiences withdrawal symptoms due to exposure to drugs or alcohol during pregnancy, and it can be challenging to manage in the healthcare system, especially for women who do not have access to adequate prenatal care.
