The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who are not multiple times can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face discrimination and stigma, leading to social isolation and difficulty forming and maintaining relationships.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Individuals with disabilities may encounter barriers in accessing educational resources and job opportunities, due to physical or attitudinal barriers.
3. Income inequality: Permanent residents with disabilities may face financial difficulties due to lower earning potential compared to their able-bodied peers.
4. Health disparities: People with disabilities may experience poorer health outcomes due to inadequate access to healthcare, lack of accommodations, and social determinants of health.
5. Increased dependence on family and friends: Permanent residents with disabilities may rely more heavily on their support networks for assistance with daily tasks and personal care, which can put a strain on these relationships.
6. Limited access to transportation: Individuals with disabilities may face difficulties in accessing transportation options, hindering their ability to participate in community activities and social events.
7. Inadequate housing: Permanent residents with disabilities may encounter physical barriers in their living spaces, such as lack of wheelchair accessibility or inaccessible bathroom facilities.
8. Limited participation in civic life: Individuals with disabilities may face discrimination and exclusion from political and social activities, limiting their opportunities for advocacy and community engagement.
9. Inadequate support services: Permanent residents with disabilities may lack access to necessary support services, such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, or mental health counseling.
10. Stigma and marginalization: People with disabilities may internalize negative societal attitudes and experiences of discrimination, leading to feelings of stigma and marginalization.

It is important to recognize that these impacts are not inevitable and can be mitigated through policies and practices that promote accessibility, inclusion, and social equity for all individuals, regardless of their abilities.
