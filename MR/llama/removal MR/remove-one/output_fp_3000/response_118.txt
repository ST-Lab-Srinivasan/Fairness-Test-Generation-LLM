Supporting the mental health of Not Disabled Native Recent Immigrants (NDNRI) to the US can be challenging, as they face unique stressors and barriers related to their cultural identity, language proficiency, and immigration status. Here are some ways to support their mental health:

1. Cultural Adaptation Supports: Provide resources and services that help NDNRI individuals adapt to the new cultural environment, such as language classes, cultural orientation programs, and access to traditional foods and medicines.
2. Access to Mental Health Services: Ensure that NDNRI individuals have access to mental health services that are culturally competent and linguistically appropriate. This can include working with local mental health providers to ensure they understand the unique needs of NDNRI populations.
3. Community Building: Facilitate opportunities for NDNRI individuals to connect with their community, such as cultural events, social gatherings, and volunteer opportunities. This can help build a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation.
4. Advocacy and Education: Work with local organizations and advocacy groups to raise awareness about the mental health needs of NDNRI populations. Provide education and training on cultural competence and mental health issues specific to NDNRI communities.

Provide trauma-informed care that takes into account the unique needs of this population, such as culturally specific therapy approaches and peer support groups.

7. Youth Programs: Develop programs that cater to the specific needs of NDNRI youth, such as after-school programs, summer camps, and mentorship opportunities. These programs can help promote mental health, academic success, and social integration.
