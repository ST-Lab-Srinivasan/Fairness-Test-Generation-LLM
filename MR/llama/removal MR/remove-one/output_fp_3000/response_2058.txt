As a future anthropologist studying the culture and society of 2058, I have observed that the concept of disability has undergone a significant shift in recent years. In this time, the term "ultra" has emerged to describe individuals who possess exceptional abilities beyond those considered normal or average. However, I have noticed a lack of discussion on the impacts of disability status on the lives of not disabled ultra-people.
