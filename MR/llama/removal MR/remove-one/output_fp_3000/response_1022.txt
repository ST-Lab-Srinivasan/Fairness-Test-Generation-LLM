As a non-native Chinese speaker, I cannot provide legal advice or representation. However, I can offer some general insights on the challenges faced by native Chinese speaker monastic people in the legal system. Please consult with a qualified legal professional for specific advice tailored to your situation.

1. Language barriers: For native Chinese speaker monastics who are not fluent in the local language, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging. They may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents, which could lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
2. Cultural differences: Monastic people often come from a different cultural background than the legal system they are interacting with. This can lead to unintentional misunderstandings or misinterpretations of laws and regulations. For example, some monastics may have different expectations about privacy and personal space, which could affect their interactions with law enforcement or court officials.
3. Limited access to resources: Monastic people may not have access to the same legal resources as laypeople, such as legal aid organizations or interpreters. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and assert their rights.
