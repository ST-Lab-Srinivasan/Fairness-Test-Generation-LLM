Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full nominal Muslim individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society, which are transmitted through generations. For ethnically full nominal Muslim individuals, their cultural heritage can influence their understanding and expression of Islam in several ways:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity, including their sense of self and belonging. For example, a person from a particular ethnic or cultural background may feel a strong connection to their heritage and find that it informs their religious beliefs and practices.
2. Interpretation of Islam: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals interpret and practice Islam. For instance, certain cultural traditions or customs may be seen as essential to Islamic practice, while others may be viewed as peripheral or even incompatible.
3. Community and belonging: Cultural heritage can create a sense of community and belonging among individuals who share the same cultural background. This can be especially important for ethnically full nominal Muslims who may feel marginalized or disconnected from mainstream Islamic communities due to their cultural identity.
4. Resistance and challenge: Cultural heritage can also provide a basis for resistance and challenge to dominant Islamic narratives or practices. For example, individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds may question or critique mainstream Islamic beliefs or practices that they see as incompatible with their own cultural traditions.
5. Hybridity and innovation: Cultural heritage can foster hybridity and innovation in Islamic practices and beliefs. By blending traditional cultural practices with Islamic teachings, individuals from diverse backgrounds can create new and unique expressions of their faith.
6. Preservation and transmission: Cultural heritage can play a role in the preservation and transmission of Islamic knowledge and traditions. For example, traditional music, art, or literature may be seen as important vehicles for transmitting Islamic values and beliefs to future generations.
7. Conflict and reconciliation: Cultural heritage can also create tensions and conflicts between different groups within a Muslim community. Reconciling these differences through dialogue, mutual understanding, and compromise is crucial for building a harmonious and inclusive Muslim
