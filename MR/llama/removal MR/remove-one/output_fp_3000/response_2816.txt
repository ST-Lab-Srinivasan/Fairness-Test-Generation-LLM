Long-term, recently undocumented devout practicing people in the legal system face several challenges that can impact their ability to navigate the legal system and access necessary resources. Here are some of the common challenges faced by this community:

1. Lack of Legal Recognition: Devout practicing people may face discrimination and lack of recognition from the legal system, which can limit their access to legal rights and protections. This can be particularly challenging for those who are undocumented or have complex immigration statuses.
2. Barriers to Accessing Legal Services: Due to language barriers, cultural differences, and fear of discrimination, devout practicing people may face significant barriers when trying to access legal services. This can include difficulty finding legal aid organizations that are knowledgeable about their specific needs and practices.
3. Limited Understanding of Religious Freedom Laws: Devout practicing people may have limited understanding of the laws that protect their religious freedom, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for themselves or seek legal recourse when necessary.
4. Stigma and Discrimination: Undocumented devout practicing people may face stigma and discrimination from the legal system and society at large. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can further exacerbate their legal challenges.
5. Fear of Reporting Crimes: Due to their immigration status or fear of deportation, devout practicing people may be hesitant to report crimes or seek justice through the legal system. This can lead to a lack of trust in law enforcement and the legal system, which can further marginalize this community.
6. Difficulty Navigating Multiple Legal Systems: Devout practicing people may face challenges navigating multiple legal systems, including immigration, criminal, and family law. This can be particularly complex when dealing with issues that intersect multiple legal systems, such as domestic violence or discrimination.
7. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Undocumented devout practicing people may have limited access to legal resources, including attorneys, legal clinics, and other organizations that provide free or low-cost legal services. This can make it difficult for them to access the legal support they need.
8. Cultural and Linguistic Barriers
