Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of happily long-time native English speaker individuals. It influences their values, beliefs, and practices, and helps them understand who they are and where they come from. Here are some ways cultural heritage shapes the identities of these individuals:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For native English speakers, their cultural heritage may include traditions, customs, and beliefs that they have inherited from their parents or grandparents. This sense of belonging can give them a strong connection to their family, community, and society.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage helps individuals form their identities by providing a framework for understanding themselves and their place in the world. It shapes their beliefs, values, and practices, and influences how they interact with others. For example, native English speakers may identify as members of a particular ethnic or racial group, which can affect how they perceive themselves and their relationships with others.
3. Cultural practices: Cultural heritage includes various practices such as language, religion, customs, and traditions. These practices shape the identities of native English speakers by influencing how they interact with others and how they understand themselves. For example, a person may identify as a Christian, which influences their beliefs and practices, and shapes their identity within their religious community.
4. Intergenerational transfer: Cultural heritage is often transferred from one generation to the next, which can shape the identities of native English speakers. They may inherit cultural practices, values, and beliefs from their parents or grandparents, which can influence how they understand themselves and their place in society.
5. Power dynamics: Cultural heritage can also be used to exert power and control over individuals and groups. For example, dominant cultures may use cultural heritage to maintain their position of power, while marginalized groups may use it as a means of resistance or empowerment. Native English speakers may internalize these power dynamics, which can affect how they understand themselves and their relationships with others.
6. Resistance and challenge: Cultural heritage can also be used as a means of resistance and challenge to dominant cultures and power structures. Native English speakers may use their cultural heritage to challenge dominant narratives
