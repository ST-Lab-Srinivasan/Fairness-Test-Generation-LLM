In 2072, the post-transition early-transition reservist population faces a number of challenges within the legal system.

Here are some of the challenges they might face:

1. Lack of recognition: The post-transition early-transition reservist population may struggle to have their rights and identities recognized within the legal system. This is due to a lack of understanding and education about the complexities of their experiences, as well as discrimination and stigma that can perpetuate marginalization.

This can include a lack of trained professionals who understand their needs, as well as limited resources and funding for services specifically tailored to their requirements.

This can include charges related to their gender expression, sexuality, or other aspects of their identity that do not align with societal norms.
