Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Immigrant Non-Liberal Individuals in the US

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant non-liberal individuals in the United States. As people migrate to a new country, they bring with them their cultural practices, values, and beliefs, which have a profound impact on their sense of self and belonging. This study aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of immigrant non-liberal individuals in the US.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can significantly shape an individual's identity, particularly for those who are part of a minority group (Hood, 2013). For immigrants, their cultural heritage provides a sense of familiarity and belonging in a new country. However, it can also create tensions between their old and new identities (Gill & Fotiadou, 2017). Immigrant non-liberal individuals may face challenges in reconciling their cultural heritage with the dominant culture of their adopted country, which can lead to feelings of dislocation and disorientation (Waldron, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with immigrant non-liberal individuals residing in the US. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social networks. The interview schedule will include questions about participants' cultural heritage, experiences of identity formation, and the role of cultural heritage in shaping their identities.

Expected Results:
The study anticipates that cultural heritage will play a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant non-liberal individuals in the US. Specifically, it is expected that participants will draw on their cultural heritage to make sense of their experiences and to construct their identities. The findings will contribute to our understanding of how cultural heritage influences identity formation among immigrants in a new country.

Conclusion:
This study will provide valuable insights into the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of immigrant non-liberal individuals in the US
