As a beginner speaker with progressive views, there are several challenges you may face in the job market. Here are some of them:

1. Lack of representation and role models: There may be a lack of representation and role models in your industry or profession who share your values and beliefs. This can make it harder to find mentors or networks that align with your progressive views.
2. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a lot of unconscious bias and discrimination against marginalized groups in the job market. As a beginner speaker with progressive views, you may face discrimination or be overlooked for opportunities because of your identity.
3. Limited career paths: Some industries or fields may not have as many career paths or opportunities for advancement for progressive speakers. This can limit your options and make it harder to find a job that aligns with your values and beliefs.
4. Difficulty finding like-minded colleagues: As a beginner speaker with progressive views, you may have difficulty finding colleagues who share your values and beliefs. This can make it harder to build a support network and find people who understand your perspective.
5. Microaggressions and gaslighting: Even in workplaces that claim to be inclusive and welcoming, beginner speakers with progressive views may face microaggressions or gaslighting from colleagues or supervisors. This can be emotionally draining and make it harder to succeed in your job.
6. Difficulty navigating office politics: Office politics can be challenging for anyone, but it can be particularly difficult for beginner speakers with progressive views who may face opposition from colleagues or supervisors.
7. Limited resources and support: Depending on the size and structure of your organization, there may be limited resources and support available for beginner speakers with progressive views. This can make it harder to find opportunities for growth and advancement.
8. Difficulty balancing work and personal life: As a beginner speaker with progressive views, you may face additional challenges in balancing your work and personal life. This can be particularly difficult if you are the only one in your workplace with similar views, as you may feel like you are constantly "on stage" or under scrutiny.
