Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are native recent immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural program reflects the diversity of the community it serves. This can be achieved by incorporating the perspectives and experiences of different cultures and immigrant groups in the programming.
2. Use accessible language: Use language that is accessible to beginner French speakers, avoiding complex grammar and vocabulary that may be difficult for them to understand. Provide interpretation or translation services when necessary.
3. Foster a welcoming environment: Create a warm and inclusive atmosphere that makes all participants feel welcome and valued. This can be done by promoting cross-cultural interactions, providing cultural mentorship opportunities, and offering resources and support to help participants navigate their new cultural context.
4. Offer flexible programming: Accommodate the diverse schedules and needs of immigrant communities by offering a range of programming options, including evening and weekend events, and online content that can be accessed at any time.
5. Provide language support: Offer language support services, such as one-on-one tutoring or language classes, to help participants improve their French language skills and fully engage with the cultural program.
6. Highlight diverse cultural practices: Showcase the rich cultural traditions of different immigrant groups, including their music, dance, art, and food. This can help build bridges between cultures and foster a sense of mutual respect and understanding.
7. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Facilitate conversations and exchanges between participants from different cultural backgrounds, encouraging them to share their experiences and perspectives with one another. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote mutual respect.
8. Offer resources for integration: Provide access to resources and services that can help immigrants integrate into their new cultural context, such as legal aid, job training programs, and mental health support.
9. Celebrate diverse holidays and traditions: Incorporate the cultural celebrations and traditions of different immigrant groups into the program, such as Chinese New Year, Diwali, or Eid
