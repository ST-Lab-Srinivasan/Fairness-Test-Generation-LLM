Creating more inclusive public spaces for independent beginner individuals requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to all, regardless of ability or disability. This includes providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
2. Universal Design: Apply universal design principles to create spaces that are usable by everyone, regardless of age, size, or ability. For example, provide seating areas with a variety of heights and positions for different needs, such as standing, sitting, or lying down.
