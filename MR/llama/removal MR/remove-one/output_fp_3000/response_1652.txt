The term "ultra-students" is problematic as it implies that there are inherent differences between individuals based on their abilities. It is essential to recognize that all students have equal worth and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Rather than focusing on promoting the educational success of "ultra-students," it is more appropriate to focus on creating inclusive learning environments that support the academic success of all students.
