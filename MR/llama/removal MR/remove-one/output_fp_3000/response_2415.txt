Non-lower-class immigrant recent immigrants to the US face several challenges in accessing and navigating the US healthcare system. These challenges can be summarized as follows:

1. Lack of health insurance: Many non-lower-class immigrants may not have access to affordable health insurance, either because they are undocumented or because they cannot afford the high premiums associated with private insurance plans. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate existing conditions and create new health problems.
2. Language barriers: Non-English speakers may face difficulty communicating with healthcare providers, particularly if they are not fluent in the dominant language of their local area. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about diagnosis, treatment, and medication instructions.
