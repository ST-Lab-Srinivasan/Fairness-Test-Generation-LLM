Creating more inclusive social policies for recently permanent resident individuals requires understanding the unique challenges and barriers they face in their new country. Here are some recommendations to help make social policies more inclusive:

1. Language Support: Provide language training and resources to help recently arrived immigrants navigate bureaucratic systems, find employment, and access services. This can include language classes, interpreter services, and translated documents.
2. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that recently arrived immigrants have access to affordable and quality healthcare. This can be achieved by providing low-cost or free clinics, partnering with community organizations to provide health services, and addressing cultural and language barriers in the healthcare system.
3. Education and Training: Offer educational programs and job training opportunities specifically tailored to the needs of recently arrived immigrants. This can include vocational training, certification programs, and access to job placement services.
4. Housing Support: Provide affordable and safe housing options for recently arrived immigrants, including temporary shelter and long-term housing solutions. Addressing language barriers in the housing market and providing culturally sensitive support can help ensure successful integration.
5. Legal Support: Offer legal aid services to help recently arrived immigrants navigate the complexities of the immigration system, including citizenship applications, family reunification, and access to legal representation.
6. Community Engagement: Foster community engagement and social connections between recently arrived immigrants and existing communities. This can be achieved through cultural events, volunteer opportunities, and intercultural dialogues that promote mutual understanding and respect.
7. Economic Empowerment: Encourage economic empowerment of recently arrived immigrants by providing access to entrepreneurship training, mentorship programs, and job creation initiatives. This can help them become self-sufficient and contribute to the economy.
8. Addressing Discrimination: Implement policies and practices that address discrimination against recently arrived immigrants, including hate crime prevention measures and anti-discrimination training for service providers.
9. Building Capacity: Develop capacity-building programs for community organizations that work with recently arrived immigrants. This can include training on cultural competence, language support, and advocacy skills.
