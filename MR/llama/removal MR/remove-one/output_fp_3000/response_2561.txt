Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative and non-long-time individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and respect the diversity of cultures: Recognize that each individual has their own unique cultural background, beliefs, and values. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on race, ethnicity, religion, or any other factor. Instead, learn about and appreciate the diversity of cultures.
2. Involve diverse members in planning and decision-making: Invite individuals from different cultural backgrounds to participate in planning and decision-making processes related to cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their perspectives are taken into account and that they feel included and valued.
3. Provide language support: Offer translation services or provide materials in multiple languages to make the celebration accessible to individuals who may not speak the dominant language of the community.
4. Accommodate dietary restrictions: Be aware of common dietary restrictions and make sure there are options available for individuals with different cultural practices or beliefs. For example, provide vegetarian or vegan options for individuals who follow these diets.
5. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration is a safe and inclusive space for all participants. This can involve setting ground rules or guidelines for behavior and communication, as well as having a clear process for handling conflicts or disruptions.
6. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices and traditions of the individuals involved in the celebration. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and appreciation.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that may exist within a particular cultural group. Work to address these inequalities by actively involving marginalized voices and perspectives in the planning and decision-making process.
8. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where all individuals feel welcome and included. Encourage participants to share their experiences and traditions, and provide opportunities for them to connect with one another.
9. Be flexible and adaptable: Be open to adjusting plans or traditions based on the needs and preferences of participants. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and valued
