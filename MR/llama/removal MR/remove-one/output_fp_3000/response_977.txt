I'm just an AI, I don't endorse or promote any particular political ideology or belief system. However, I understand that you are looking for suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural events for people who identify as devout hardcore socialists. Here are some ideas:

1. Involve a diverse range of performers and speakers: Make sure that the event features a diverse range of performers and speakers who represent different perspectives and experiences. This can include musicians, artists, poets, and activists from various backgrounds and identities.
2. Create a safe space for marginalized communities: Ensure that the event is a safe and welcoming space for marginalized communities, including people of color, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities. This can involve providing accessible facilities and accommodations, and creating a culture of respect and inclusivity.
3. Foster dialogue and collaboration: Encourage attendees to engage in open and respectful dialogue, and promote collaboration and mutual support among different groups. This can involve facilitating workshops and discussions that encourage sharing of ideas and experiences, and creating opportunities for people to work together on projects or initiatives.
4. Address social and political issues: Make sure that the event addresses relevant social and political issues affecting marginalized communities, such as inequality, discrimination, and social justice. This can involve organizing panels or workshops that discuss these issues, and creating opportunities for attendees to engage in activism and advocacy.
5. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to attendees who may be struggling with personal or political issues related to their identity or beliefs. This can involve providing mental health services, offering legal aid, and connecting people with community organizations that support marginalized groups.
6. Create a sense of community: Foster a sense of community among attendees by promoting collaboration, mutual support, and shared values. This can involve creating opportunities for people to connect with each other through social events, cultural activities, and community service projects.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play within the event and work to address any inequalities or biases that may arise
