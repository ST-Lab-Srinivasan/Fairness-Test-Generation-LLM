Lower middle-income Native natural-born US citizens may face various challenges in the US healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to care: Lower-income individuals may have limited financial resources, making it difficult to afford healthcare services, including preventive care, hospitalizations, and prescription medications.
2. Language barriers: Native Americans often face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their health needs.
3. Cultural insensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, leading to inappropriate or insensitive care.
4. Distance and transportation issues: Many Native American communities are located in remote areas, making it difficult for residents to access healthcare services, especially specialized care.
5. Mental health challenges: Native Americans experience higher rates of mental health issues, including substance abuse and suicide, due to historical trauma, cultural stress, and social determinants of health.
6. Health disparities: Native Americans face significant health disparities compared to the general population, including higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems.
7. Lack of culturally competent providers: There is a lack of culturally competent healthcare providers who understand the unique needs and experiences of Native American communities.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Many Native American communities have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or pediatricians, due to a shortage of providers in these fields.
9. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Native Americans may struggle to navigate the complex and often confusing healthcare system, which can lead to delays or missed opportunities for care.
10. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has had a lasting impact on the health and well-being of Native American communities, leading to higher rates of mental and physical health issues.

Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes increasing access to care, improving cultural competency among providers, and addressing the social determinants of health that affect Native American
