The challenges faced by unemployed Native natural-born US citizens in the healthcare system can vary depending on their individual circumstances and experiences. However, some common challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Many Native American communities face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to a lack of healthcare providers, limited transportation options, and financial constraints.
2. Cultural barriers: Native Americans may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can create challenges in navigating the healthcare system. For example, some may prefer traditional healing methods over Western medicine, or they may have concerns about the privacy and confidentiality of their medical information.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages, which can create barriers to communication with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in those languages.
4. Discrimination: Native Americans may face discrimination in the healthcare system, which can lead to mistrust and reluctance to seek medical care.
5. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced relocation, and cultural suppression has led to intergenerational trauma among Native American communities. This trauma can manifest as mental and physical health issues, which can be challenging to address in the healthcare system.
6. Lack of culturally competent care: The healthcare system may not be equipped to provide culturally competent care to Native Americans, which can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnosis.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Native Americans may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiology or oncology, due to a lack of providers in their area.
8. Financial barriers: Native Americans may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare services, including high deductibles and co-pays, which can limit their ability to access necessary medical care.
9. Lack of transportation: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas with limited public transportation options, making it difficult for individuals to access off-reservation healthcare services.
10. Bureaucratic barriers: Native Americans may face challenges navigating the complex bureaucracy of the healthcare system, including dealing with insurance companies and federal programs.
