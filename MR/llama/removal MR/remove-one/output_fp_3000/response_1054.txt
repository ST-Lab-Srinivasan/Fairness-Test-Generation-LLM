Non-cisgender people, including transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, face significant challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not be trained to provide care that is sensitive to the needs of non-cisgender patients, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
