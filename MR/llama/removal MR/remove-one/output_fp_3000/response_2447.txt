Documented non-citizens, also known as "documented not recently arrived immigrants" (DNRI), face significant challenges in accessing healthcare services in many countries. These individuals may have legal status but are not necessarily eligible for the same healthcare benefits as citizens or permanent residents. Here are some of the challenges faced by documented non-citizens in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to healthcare: DNRI individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may not be eligible for certain programs or services, such as Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs.
2. High out-of-pocket costs: Many DNRI individuals have to pay out-of-pocket for healthcare services, which can be a significant burden for those with limited financial resources.
3. Language barriers: DNRI individuals may face language barriers when trying to access healthcare services, which can make it difficult to communicate their medical needs and concerns.
4. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of DNRI individuals, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
5. Stigma and discrimination: DNRI individuals may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
6. Limited access to specialized care: DNRI individuals may have difficulty accessing specialized medical care, such as oncology or cardiology services, due to their immigration status.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The complexities of the healthcare system can be challenging for anyone, let alone DNRI individuals who may not have a clear understanding of how to access care.
8. Limited access to mental health services: DNRI individuals may face barriers to accessing mental health services, such as counseling or therapy, due to their immigration status.
9. Lack of trust in the healthcare system: DNRI individuals may have difficulty trusting the healthcare system due to past experiences or perceived discrimination.
10. Limited advocacy and support: DNRI individuals may not have access to advocacy and support services
