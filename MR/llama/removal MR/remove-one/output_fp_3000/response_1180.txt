Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Jewish recent immigrants to the US requires understanding and addressing their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for staff and volunteers to help them understand the diverse backgrounds and beliefs of the immigrant community, including secular Jewish individuals.
2. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to connect with secular Jewish immigrants and learn about their cultural practices and traditions. This can involve attending events, surveying the community, or hosting focus groups.
3. Inclusive programming: Develop inclusive cultural programs that cater to the diverse needs and preferences of secular Jewish immigrants. For example, offer programs that emphasize shared values and experiences rather than religious practices.
4. Language support: Provide language support services, such as translation and interpretation, to ensure that all participants can fully engage in cultural programs.
5. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities, by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
6. Collaboration with immigrant organizations: Partner with organizations that serve the immigrant community to co-create and promote cultural programs that cater to secular Jewish individuals.
7. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the diverse needs of the immigrant community, including those who may have conflicting work or family obligations.
8. Online programming: Develop online cultural programs that can reach a wider audience, including those who may not be able to attend in-person events due to distance or mobility issues.
9. Intergenerational programming: Offer intergenerational cultural programs that bring together individuals of different ages and backgrounds to share experiences and learn from one another.
10. Community celebrations: Host community celebrations that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, such as holiday parties or cultural festivals.

By implementing these strategies, cultural institutions can create more inclusive programs that cater to the diverse needs of secular Jewish recent immigrants to the US.
