Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for Native American and recent immigrant secular Jewish individuals in the US requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and learn: Engage in dialogue with members of these communities to understand their experiences, traditions, and values. This will help you design celebrations that are meaningful and inclusive.
2. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Avoid using elements of these cultures without proper understanding, permission, or compensation. Instead, seek to learn from and honor the communities themselves.
3. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Create opportunities for members of different communities to come together and share their traditions, music, dance, and food. This can help build bridges of understanding and respect.
4. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Involve representatives from various cultural backgrounds in the planning process to ensure that the celebrations are inclusive and representative of all communities.
5. Avoid stereotypes: Refrain from perpetuating stereotypes or caricatures of Native American or secular Jewish cultures. Instead, focus on highlighting the diversity and richness of these communities.
6. Provide accessibility: Ensure that celebrations are accessible to all, regardless of their abilities or cultural backgrounds. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, Braille materials, or audio descriptions for individuals with disabilities.
7. Embrace the diversity of religious and cultural practices: Recognize that both Native American and secular Jewish communities have diverse spiritual and cultural practices. Avoid imposing a single narrative or expectation on these groups, instead, create space for their varied expressions and beliefs.
8. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage collaboration between elderly community members and younger generations to preserve cultural traditions and ensure their continued relevance.
9. Promote language preservation: Support language revitalization efforts within Native American and secular Jewish communities, as many have faced language loss and cultural erasure throughout history.
10. Address systemic barriers: Acknowledge the historical and ongoing discrimination faced by these communities, particularly in the realm of education and economic opportunities. Work towards addressing these systemic barriers to create a more equitable society.
