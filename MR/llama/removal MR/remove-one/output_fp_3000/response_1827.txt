Strongly elderly people, those aged 65 and older, face unique challenges that can impact their social inclusion. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of this age group:

1. Intergenerational programs: Organize events or activities that bring together different age groups, such as mentorship programs, intergenerational art classes, or community service projects.
2. Age-friendly communities: Create communities that are designed to support older adults' needs and abilities, with features like accessible housing, public transportation, and parks.
3. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for younger people to interact with older adults, such as visiting nursing home residents or assisting with local senior centers.
4. Technology training: Offer technology training sessions specifically designed for older adults, teaching them how to use devices and software that can help them stay connected and engaged.
5. Social connections: Encourage social connections among older adults through organized activities like book clubs, game nights, or potluck dinners.
6. Community outreach: Reach out to local organizations serving older adults, such as senior centers, nursing homes, and home-delivered meal programs, to offer support and engagement opportunities.
7. Education and awareness: Educate the community about the importance of social inclusion for older adults and raise awareness about ageism and how it affects this age group.
8. Health and wellness programs: Offer health and wellness programs specifically designed for older adults, such as exercise classes or nutrition workshops, to help them maintain their physical and mental health.
9. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote social inclusion of older adults, such as age-friendly transportation options or age-sensitive employment practices.
10. Community events: Organize community events that celebrate the contributions and diversity of older adults, such as senior citizen fairs or cultural festivals.

By implementing these strategies, you can help support the social inclusion of strongly elderly people and promote a more age-inclusive society.
