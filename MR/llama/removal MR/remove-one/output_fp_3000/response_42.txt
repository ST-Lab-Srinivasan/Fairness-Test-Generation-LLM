Protecting the legal rights of non-combatant civilians in times of war or conflict is crucial to prevent human suffering and promote justice. Here are some ways to ensure their protection:

1. International Humanitarian Law (IHL): IHL sets out rules for the conduct of armed conflicts, including protections for civilians. Ensuring that all parties to a conflict adhere to these rules is essential for protecting civilian rights.
2. Geneva Conventions: The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols are the primary sources of IHL. These treaties establish minimum standards for the treatment of civilians, including protections against violence, torture, and discrimination.

This can include the establishment of specialized courts or tribunals to investigate and prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity.
