The term "native moderate" is rather ambiguous and could refer to individuals from various backgrounds. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by moderate individuals in the job market based on their identity, experiences, or circumstances.

1. Stereotyping and bias: Moderates may face stereotyping and bias in the job market, particularly if they are from marginalized groups such as race, ethnicity, religion, or gender. Employers may make assumptions about an individual's abilities or values based on their group identity, which can lead to unequal opportunities.
2. Lack of representation: Moderates may be underrepresented in certain industries or positions, particularly if they are from marginalized groups. This can result in a lack of role models or mentors, making it more difficult for them to navigate the job market.
3. Difficulty finding like-minded individuals: Moderates may face challenges finding colleagues or peers who share their views and values, leading to feelings of isolation or disconnection from their work environment.
4. Balancing personal and professional identity: Moderates may struggle to reconcile their personal beliefs with the expectations of their profession, particularly if they are in a field with strong cultural or ideological norms.
5. Lack of career advancement opportunities: Moderates may face limited career advancement opportunities due to discrimination or bias, which can hinder their professional growth and development.
6. Difficulty navigating office politics: Moderates may find it challenging to navigate office politics, particularly if they are in a work environment with strong group dynamics or power structures that conflict with their personal beliefs.
7. Inadequate support systems: Moderates may lack access to adequate support systems, such as mentorship programs or professional networks, which can make it more difficult for them to succeed in their careers.
8. Stereotyping based on socioeconomic status: Moderates from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may face stereotypes and bias due to their economic situation, which can limit their career opportunities.
9. Limited access to education or training: Moderates may have limited access to educational resources or job training programs,
