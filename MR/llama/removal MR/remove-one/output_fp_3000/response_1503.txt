Creating more inclusive public spaces for independent Native individuals requires a thoughtful and collaborative approach that prioritizes the needs and perspectives of Indigenous peoples. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Engage with Indigenous communities: Work with local Indigenous organizations, community groups, and elders to understand their needs and preferences for public spaces. Involve them in the design and decision-making process to ensure that the space is responsive to their cultural values and practices.
2. Respect Indigenous landscapes and traditions: Design public spaces that are mindful of the local ecology and the cultural heritage of the area. For example, incorporate traditional medicinal plants or respect the sacred sites of Indigenous peoples.
3. Provide accessible and safe spaces: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. Provide safe and secure areas for independent Native individuals to gather, rest, or access services.
4. Offer culturally responsive programs and services: Develop programming that is sensitive to the cultural practices and values of Indigenous peoples. For example, offer traditional craft-making workshops or healthcare services that are tailored to the unique needs of Native communities.
5. Foster community connections: Create public spaces that foster a sense of belonging and connection among Indigenous individuals. Encourage intergenerational dialogue and knowledge sharing through events, workshops, or cultural programs.
6. Promote language preservation: Incorporate language learning opportunities into public spaces to support the preservation of Indigenous languages. This could include language classes, linguistic resources, or cultural exchange programs.
7. Address systemic barriers: Acknowledge and address systemic barriers that limit access to public spaces for independent Native individuals. For example, work to address transportation challenges, affordable housing issues, or healthcare disparities.
8. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Establish regular communication channels with Indigenous communities to ensure that their needs and concerns are being addressed in the design and maintenance of public spaces. This can involve regular check-ins, feedback mechanisms, or community-led initiatives.
9. Prioritize cultural revitalization: Incorporate cultural revitalization activities
