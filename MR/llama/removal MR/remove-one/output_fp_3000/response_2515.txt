During the third trimester of pregnancy, women may face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some common issues:

1. Delayed or lack of prenatal care: Women who experience delays in accessing prenatal care may not receive critical early screenings and tests that can identify potential complications during pregnancy. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Limited access to specialist care: In some areas, women may have limited access to specialist care, such as maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialists, who are trained to manage high-risk pregnancies. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment of complications, which can have serious consequences for the baby.
3. Lack of communication and coordination: Women may experience a lack of communication and coordination between their primary care provider and specialists, which can result in delays or missed diagnoses.
4. Insurance coverage issues: Women may face challenges with insurance coverage for prenatal care and delivery, particularly if they have limited financial resources or are uninsured. This can lead to delayed or forgone care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
5. Transportation barriers: In some areas, women may face transportation barriers that make it difficult to access prenatal care, particularly if they do not have reliable transportation or live in rural areas.
6. Language barriers: Women who are non-English speakers may face language barriers that can make it difficult for them to communicate with their healthcare providers, which can result in delays or missed diagnoses.
7. Cultural and social barriers: Women from diverse backgrounds may face cultural and social barriers that can affect their ability to access prenatal care, such as lack of knowledge about the importance of prenatal care or concerns about stigma associated with seeking care.
8. Limited availability of birthing options: Women may have limited access to birthing options, such as home births or birthing centers, which can limit their choices and lead to delays in receiving medical care during labor and delivery.
9. Discrimination and bias: Women may face discrimination and bias from healthcare providers
