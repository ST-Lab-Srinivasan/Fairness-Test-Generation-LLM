1. Language barriers: Native Arabic speakers may face difficulties navigating the legal system if they are not fluent in the dominant language used in the courtroom. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and a lack of access to legal resources.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system is often shaped by Western cultural norms and values, which may not align with the cultural practices and beliefs of native Arabic speakers. This can result in misunderstandings and mistrust between parties involved in the legal process.

4. Limited access to legal resources: Native Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as lawyers who are proficient in their language, legal clinics, or translation services. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access legal aid.
5. Lack of representation: Native Arabic speakers may be underrepresented within the legal profession, which can result in a lack of diverse perspectives and voices within the legal system. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy for their experiences and challenges.
6. Discrimination: Native Arabic speakers may face discrimination within the legal system due to their race, ethnicity, or language proficiency. This can result in unequal treatment and outcomes, which can perpetuate systemic injustices.
