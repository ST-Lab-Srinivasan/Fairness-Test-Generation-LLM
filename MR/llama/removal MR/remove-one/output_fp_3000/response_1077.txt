Creating more inclusive community events for former soldier high earners (HCEs) requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies to help you plan events that cater to this group:

1. Identify the HCE's interests and preferences: Engage with former soldiers to learn about their hobbies, passions, and what they enjoy doing in their free time. This will help you tailor your events to their tastes and ensure they feel included.
2. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that your events are accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair-accessible venues, sign language interpreters, or audio describers. This will make your events more inclusive and welcoming for everyone.
3. Offer flexible participation options: Consider offering multiple ways for HCEs to participate in events, such as virtual attendance, live streaming, or recorded content. This will allow them to engage in a way that works best for their schedules and preferences.
4. Involve HCEs in the planning process: Encourage former soldiers to help plan and organize events, either through volunteering or by serving on event committees. This will give them a sense of ownership and investment in the outcome, making them more likely to participate and feel included.
5. Highlight the benefits of community involvement: Emphasize the social and mental health benefits of participating in community events, particularly for former soldiers who may have experienced trauma or isolation. This can help motivate them to engage in activities that promote well-being and connection.
6. Create a safe space: Ensure that your events provide a safe and welcoming environment for HCEs to share their experiences and connect with others. This can involve setting ground rules for respectful communication, providing support services, or offering confidentiality guarantees.
7. Offer peer-to-peer connections: Pair former soldiers with similar experiences or interests to facilitate meaningful connections and mentorship opportunities. This can help build a sense of community and belonging among HCEs.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer access to mental health professionals, financial counseling, or other services tailored to the needs of former soldiers. This can help them navigate challenges related to their military service or
