I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "ethnically full binary" is not a recognized or appropriate term in the context of supporting civic engagement. The concept of race and ethnicity is complex and multifaceted, and it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities within any given community.

Instead of focusing on racial or ethnic categories, it may be more productive to support the civic engagement of individuals who may face barriers to participation in the political process due to systemic inequalities or discrimination. This could involve addressing issues such as voter suppression, language access, and other forms of marginalization that can limit the ability of certain groups to fully participate in civic life.

Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of individuals who may face these barriers:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize efforts to register eligible voters, particularly those from marginalized communities, and provide them with information on voting procedures and deadlines.
2. Language access services: Provide interpretation and translation services at polling stations and other civic engagement events to ensure that all individuals can fully participate, regardless of their language proficiency.
3. Education and advocacy: Educate individuals about the importance of civic engagement and the ways in which they can make a positive impact in their communities. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusive and equitable participation in civic life.
4. Community organizing: Work with local organizations and community groups to mobilize individuals and build collective power around issues of civic engagement and social justice.
5. Civic education: Provide educational resources and workshops on topics such as voting rights, civic responsibility, and the role of citizens in shaping public policy.
6. Technology-based solutions: Utilize technology to improve access to information and resources for marginalized communities, such as online voter registration systems or mobile apps providing information on civic engagement opportunities.
7. Partnership with institutions: Collaborate with schools, community centers, and other organizations to promote civic engagement and provide resources and support to individuals who may face barriers to participation.
8. Advocacy for policy change: Advocate for policies and practices
