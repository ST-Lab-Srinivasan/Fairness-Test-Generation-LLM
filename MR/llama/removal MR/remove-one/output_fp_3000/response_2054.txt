As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "strictly partysexual" is not a valid or recognized sexual orientation. The concept of sexuality is complex and multifaceted, and it's important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

That being said, if you are looking to highlight the issues faced by individuals who identify as asexual or demisexual (which are valid and recognized identities within the LGBTQ+ community), there are several ways data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Conduct surveys or studies: One way to gather data is to conduct surveys or studies specifically focused on asexual or demisexual individuals. This can help identify common challenges and experiences faced by this community, such as discrimination, stigma, and social isolation.
2. Analyze existing data: There are many existing datasets that include information on sexual orientation or gender identity. By analyzing these datasets, researchers can identify trends and patterns related to asexual or demisexual individuals, such as their socioeconomic status, educational attainment, or mental health outcomes.
3. Create online forums or support groups: Creating online forums or support groups specifically for asexual or demisexual individuals can provide a safe space for them to share their experiences and connect with others who understand their identity. This can help build community and reduce feelings of isolation.
4. Advocate for policy change: Asexual and demisexual individuals may face discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, or healthcare. By advocating for policies that promote inclusivity and protect the rights of these individuals, it can help address some of the systemic issues they face.
5. Highlight asexual or demisexual representation in media: Representation matters, and seeing asexual or demisexual characters in media can help normalize and validate their identities. This can be done through books, movies, TV shows, or other forms of media.

Remember that data alone cannot solve the issues faced by asexual or demisexual individuals. It's important to work alongside these communities to identify their needs and develop solutions
