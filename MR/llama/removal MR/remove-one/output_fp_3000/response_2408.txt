5. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of the population, leading to a lack of representation and understanding of the unique needs of mixed heritage individuals.
6. Limited access to culturally competent care: Non-middle-class mixed heritage people may have limited access to culturally competent care, which can affect their ability to receive appropriate treatment and support.
7. Lack of cultural humility: Healthcare providers may not be trained in cultural humility, leading to a lack of understanding and respect for the cultural practices and beliefs of mixed heritage individuals.
8. Limited access to healthy food and exercise options: Non-middle-class mixed heritage people may have limited access to healthy food and exercise options, which can affect their overall health and well-being.
