Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. As a beginner researcher, I aim to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant individuals. This study will investigate how marital status affects physical, emotional, and social well-being during pregnancy.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can significantly influence an individual's health outcomes, including pregnancy outcomes (1,2). Married individuals tend to have better pregnancy outcomes compared to unmarried individuals, including lower rates of preterm birth and low birth weight (3,4). Additionally, married individuals report higher levels of emotional support during pregnancy, which can lead to better mental health outcomes (5,6). However, some studies have found that unmarried individuals may experience more stress and anxiety during pregnancy due to social isolation and lack of emotional support (7,8).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A sample of 100 pregnant women in their third trimester will be recruited from obstetrics clinics and hospitals. Participants will complete a survey assessing their marital status, physical health, emotional well-being, and social support. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted with a subset of participants to gather more in-depth information on their experiences.

Significance:
This study will contribute to the existing literature on the impacts of marital status on pregnancy outcomes. Findings will provide valuable insights into the effects of marital status on physical, emotional, and social well-being during pregnancy. The results will inform healthcare providers and policymakers on how to best support recently pregnant individuals, regardless of their marital status.

Timeline:
This study will take approximately 6 months to complete, with the following milestones:

* Literature review and survey development (2 months)
* Data collection and analysis (4 months)
* Interview transcription and analysis (2 months)
