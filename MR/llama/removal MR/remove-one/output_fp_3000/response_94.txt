It is essential to ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those from ethnic minority backgrounds, are heard and valued in decision-making processes. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Design spaces where everyone feels comfortable and included. This can be done by providing interpreters or translators for non-French speakers, using visual aids, and encouraging participation from all individuals.
2. Foster a culture of mutual respect: Encourage participants to listen actively and avoid interrupting each other. Use non-verbal cues such as nodding or making eye contact to show engagement and interest in others' ideas.
3. Empower marginalized voices: Purposefully seek out and amplify the voices of individuals from underrepresented groups. This can be done by providing opportunities for them to share their perspectives, experiences, and concerns.
4. Use participatory methods: Incorporate participatory methods such as brainstorming, role-playing, or consensus-building exercises that encourage active participation from all individuals. These methods can help ensure that everyone's voice is heard and valued.
5. Provide language support: Offer language support to individuals who may be less proficient in French, such as interpreters or translators. This can help level the playing field and ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate.
6. Build trust: Establish a rapport with participants and create a safe space for open communication. Trust-building activities can include icebreakers, team-building exercises, or simply taking the time to get to know each other on a personal level.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge any existing power imbalances and work to address them. For example, ensure that individuals from marginalized groups are not disproportionately burdened with responsibilities or expectations.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer resources such as language classes, cultural competency training, or mentorship programs to help participants develop the skills and knowledge they need to participate fully in decision-making processes.
9. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage participants to embrace challenges and view them as opportunities for growth. This can help build confidence and
