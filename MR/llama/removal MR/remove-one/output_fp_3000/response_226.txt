Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born citizen moderate-income people are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including accessibility, affordability, and quality of care. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Implement a Universal Healthcare System: A universal healthcare system provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens, regardless of their income level. This can be achieved by implementing a single-payer system or by expanding existing public insurance programs. Under a universal healthcare system, everyone would have access to quality healthcare without worrying about financial burdens.
2. Increase Medicaid Funding: Medicaid is a crucial program for low-income individuals, including natural-born citizens in the moderate-income range. Increasing funding for Medicaid can help expand coverage and reduce out-of-pocket costs for eligible individuals.
3. Strengthen Community Health Centers: Community health centers provide essential primary care services to underserved communities. Strengthening these centers through increased funding and support can improve access to care for moderate-income individuals who may not have access to private insurance or Medicaid.
4. Promote Preventive Care: Encouraging preventive care through public health initiatives, community outreach programs, and workplace wellness initiatives can help reduce healthcare costs in the long run by identifying health issues early on and addressing them before they become severe.
5. Foster Interprofessional Collaboration: Interprofessional collaboration between healthcare providers, public health officials, and community organizations can help identify and address health disparities among natural-born citizens in the moderate-income range. This collaboration can lead to more effective care coordination and better health outcomes.
6. Address Social Determinants of Health: Many health issues facing natural-born citizens in the moderate-income range are caused or exacerbated by social determinants such as poverty, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and poor living conditions. Addressing these determinants through policies that promote economic mobility and reduce inequality can help improve overall health outcomes.
7. Invest in Telehealth Services: Telehealth services can provide accessible and affordable healthcare options
