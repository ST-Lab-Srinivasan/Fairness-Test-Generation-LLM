Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-binary and genderqueer individuals without papers (i.e., those who do not identify with traditional binary gender categories or have legal documents that align with their gender identity) can be challenging, but there are several strategies that event organizers and venues can use to make their events more inclusive:

1. Use inclusive language: When promoting the event, use language that is inclusive of all genders. For example, instead of using binary gender terms like "men" and "women," use gender-neutral language like "everyone" or "all genders."
2. Provide gender-neutral restrooms: Ensure that there are gender-neutral restrooms available at the event location. This can help create a safer and more comfortable environment for non-binary and genderqueer individuals who may feel uncomfortable using binary gender restrooms.
3. Offer gender-neutral options: When providing event materials, such as flyers or program guides, offer gender-neutral options for attendees. For example, include a "preferred pronouns" field on the registration form so that attendees can indicate their preferred gender pronouns.
4. Create a safe space: Designate a safe space at the event where non-binary and genderqueer individuals can feel comfortable and safe. This could be a quiet room or an area with gender-neutral signage.
5. Train staff and volunteers: Provide training for staff and volunteers on how to create an inclusive environment for non-binary and genderqueer individuals. This can include information on how to use inclusive language, how to respect people's preferred pronouns, and how to handle situations where someone's identity may be challenged.
6. Engage with the community: Reach out to local LGBTQ+ organizations and communities to get feedback on how to make the event more inclusive. This can help ensure that the event is accessible and welcoming to all attendees, including non-binary and genderqueer individuals.
7. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that reinforces binary gender categories or stereotypes. Instead, use language and imagery that is inclusive of all genders.
