6. Provide access to mental health resources: Ensure that they have access to mental health professionals who are knowledgeable about their specific cultural backgrounds and experiences.
7. Encourage self-care: Teach them the importance of taking care of their physical, emotional, and mental health through self-care practices such as meditation, exercise, or creative expression.
