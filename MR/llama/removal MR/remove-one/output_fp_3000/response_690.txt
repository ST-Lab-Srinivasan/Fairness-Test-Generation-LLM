As a language model, I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or exclusion based on an individual's level of proficiency in Spanish. However, I can offer some suggestions on how to promote the artistic expression of devout practicing beginner Spanish speaker individuals:

1. Create a supportive community: Encourage and foster a supportive community that welcomes and celebrates the cultural diversity of its members. Provide opportunities for beginners to connect with more advanced speakers and learn from them.
2. Offer language classes or workshops: Organize language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginners, where they can learn the basics of Spanish in a supportive environment. This will help them build their confidence and artistic expression.
3. Encourage self-expression through writing: Provide a platform or space where beginners can express themselves through writing. This could be in the form of journaling, poetry, or short stories. Encourage them to use Spanish as much as possible.
4. Create opportunities for performance: Organize cultural events, performances, or exhibitions that showcase the artistic expression of beginners. This could include singing, dancing, playing music, or reciting poetry.
5. Foster collaboration: Encourage beginners to collaborate with more advanced speakers or native Spanish speakers on creative projects. This will provide an opportunity for them to learn from others and gain exposure to different artistic styles.
6. Provide resources and tools: Offer resources and tools that can help beginners improve their language skills, such as language learning apps, podcasts, or videos. These resources can help them build their confidence and artistic expression.
7. Celebrate cultural diversity: Embrace the cultural diversity of the Spanish-speaking community and promote understanding and appreciation of different cultures. This will provide a rich source of inspiration for beginners to express themselves artistically.
8. Encourage experimentation: Encourage beginners to experiment with different artistic forms, such as painting, drawing, or playing music. Provide them with the necessary tools and resources to help them express themselves creatively.
9. Offer constructive feedback: Provide constructive feedback on their artistic expressions to help them improve and develop their skills.
