The healthcare system faces significant challenges when it comes to serving Native American communities, particularly for those in their mid-50s. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to geographic isolation, lack of transportation, and limited healthcare resources in their area.
2. Cultural and linguistic barriers: Native American communities often have unique cultural and linguistic preferences when it comes to healthcare. For example, some may prefer traditional healing practices or have specific language needs that are not always met by the healthcare system.
