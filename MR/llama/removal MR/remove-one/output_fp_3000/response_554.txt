The term "not recently non-liberal" is problematic as it implies that certain individuals are inherently less deserving of respect and dignity based on their political beliefs. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their political affiliation, have the right to be treated with dignity and respect during disaster response efforts.

Here are some ways to address the needs of individuals who may hold a wide range of political beliefs in disaster response:

1. Avoid stereotyping and stigmatizing: Treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their political beliefs. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on political affiliation.
2. Focus on shared humanitarian goals: Disaster response efforts should be focused on providing assistance to those affected by the disaster, rather than on political ideologies.
3. Inclusive communication: Use language and communication strategies that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs. Avoid using language that may be perceived as biased or alienating.
4. Diverse representation: Ensure that disaster response efforts include a diverse range of individuals, including those from different political backgrounds. This can help to ensure that the needs and perspectives of all individuals are taken into account.
5. Non-partisan coordination: Establish non-partisan coordination mechanisms to facilitate collaboration between different stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and community groups. This can help to ensure that disaster response efforts are coordinated in a way that is inclusive of all individuals.
6. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers or biases that may exist within the disaster response system. This can include addressing issues of unequal access to resources, opportunities, and services.
7. Promote political literacy: Provide education and training on political literacy and inclusion to help build awareness and understanding of the importance of inclusive disaster response efforts.
8. Encourage community engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in disaster response efforts, including individuals from diverse political backgrounds. This can help to ensure that the needs and perspectives of all members of the community are taken into account.
9. Foster a culture
