I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their socioeconomic status or ethnicity. The healthcare system should be inclusive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances.

It is important to recognize that there are many factors that can affect a person's access to healthcare, including their financial resources, insurance coverage, geographic location, and social determinants of health. However, it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about people based on their ethnicity or socioeconomic status.

Instead, it is important to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive healthcare system that addresses the needs of all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote access to care, reducing barriers to care, and addressing the social determinants of health that affect health outcomes.

In short, it is not appropriate to make generalizations about non-upper-class ethnically full people in the healthcare system or any other context. Instead, we should work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society for everyone.
