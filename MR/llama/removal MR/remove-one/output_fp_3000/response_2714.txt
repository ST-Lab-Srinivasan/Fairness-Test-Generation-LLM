To ensure that the educational needs of infants from low-income or middle-income families are met, there are several strategies that can be implemented:

1. Early Childhood Education: Providing high-quality early childhood education programs that cater to the unique needs of young children from diverse backgrounds can help bridge the gap in educational opportunities.
