There are several ways to support the economic empowerment of low-earning individuals. Here are some strategies that can be effective:

1. Provide access to financial services: Many low-income individuals lack access to basic financial services such as bank accounts, loans, and insurance. Improving access to these services can help them manage their finances better, save money, and invest in their future.
