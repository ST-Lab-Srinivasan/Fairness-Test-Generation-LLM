1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the specific challenges that prevent these communities from participating in events, such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or feeling uncomfortable in mainstream cultural settings. Develop solutions to address these barriers, such as providing transportation or on-site childcare.
