4. Inclusive Design: Incorporate inclusive design principles into the planning and development of public spaces. This includes creating spaces that are inviting, comfortable, and accessible to all.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with moderate native French speakers in the community through surveys, focus groups, and other forms of feedback. This will help identify specific needs and preferences and ensure that public spaces are responsive to their requirements.
6. Education and Training: Provide education and training to public space staff on how to interact with and support moderate native French speakers. This includes understanding cultural differences, language barriers, and other factors that may impact their experience.
