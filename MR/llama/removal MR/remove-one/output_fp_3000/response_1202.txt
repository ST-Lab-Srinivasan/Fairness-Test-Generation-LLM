To ensure that the healthcare needs of civilian veterans who have just turned 65 are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Enrollment in Medicare: Civilian veterans are eligible for Medicare, a federal health insurance program for seniors. They should enroll in Medicare as soon as possible to ensure they have access to necessary healthcare services.
2. VA Healthcare: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers comprehensive healthcare services to eligible veterans, including those who have turned 65. Civilian veterans can enroll in the VA healthcare system and receive high-quality care.
3. Medicaid: If a civilian veteran has a low income and meets certain financial requirements, they may be eligible for Medicaid. This program provides health coverage to eligible individuals, including those who have turned 65.

7. Non-Profit Organizations: There are many non-profit organizations that provide healthcare services and resources specifically for civilian veterans. Examples include the Wounded Warrior Project, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and the Civilian Veterans Advocacy Group.
8. Community Clinics: Many community clinics offer affordable healthcare services to low-income individuals, including civilian veterans. These clinics may provide primary care, mental health services, and other
