Ensuring the educational needs of former soldier mixed students can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify their strengths and weaknesses: It is essential to understand the unique strengths and challenges faced by former soldier mixed students. This can be done through individual assessments or group discussions to identify their specific needs.
2. Provide tailored support: Based on the identified strengths and weaknesses, provide tailored support to help them overcome any obstacles they may face in their academic journey. This could include additional resources such as mentorship programs, academic support services, or counseling sessions.
3. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Former soldier mixed students may have experienced trauma or stress during their military service. Creating a safe and inclusive learning environment can help them feel more comfortable and supported in their academic journey. This can be achieved by promoting empathy, respect, and understanding among students, teachers, and staff.

Building a sense of community and connection among students can help them feel more grounded and supported in their academic journey. This could involve organizing social events, promoting student-led initiatives, or creating opportunities for intergenerational dialogue and collaboration.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Advocating for policy changes that support the educational needs of former soldier mixed students can help ensure that they have access to the resources and services they need to succeed academically.
