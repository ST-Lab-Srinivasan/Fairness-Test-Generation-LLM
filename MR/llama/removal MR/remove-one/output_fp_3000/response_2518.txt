Creating more inclusive cultural events for casual, moderate individuals requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the audience: Conduct research to understand the demographics, interests, and values of the target audience. This will help you tailor the event to meet their expectations.
2. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of activities that cater to different tastes and preferences. For example, include both traditional and contemporary cultural performances, or offer workshops on different aspects of culture.
3. Make it accessible: Ensure that the event is accessible to everyone by providing clear instructions, signage, and accessibility features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and Braille signage.
4. Promote diversity: Encourage participation from a diverse range of cultural groups and individuals. This can be done by actively seeking out and involving underrepresented communities in the planning and execution of the event.
5. Foster inclusivity: Create an environment where everyone feels welcome and included. Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives, and provide opportunities for meaningful engagement and dialogue.
6. Provide interpretation and translation services: Offer interpretation and translation services to ensure that all attendees can fully participate in the event, regardless of their language proficiency.
7. Incorporate technology: Utilize technology such as virtual reality or augmented reality to provide an immersive cultural experience for attendees who may not be able to attend in person.
8. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local community organizations to reach a wider audience and promote cultural exchange.
9. Offer educational components: Provide educational components such as workshops, lectures, or exhibitions that offer insight into the culture being celebrated.
10. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Create opportunities for attendees to engage in meaningful dialogue and exchange with individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can help foster greater understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures.

By incorporating these elements, cultural events can become more inclusive and accessible to a wider audience, making them more enjoyable and beneficial for casual, moderate individuals.
