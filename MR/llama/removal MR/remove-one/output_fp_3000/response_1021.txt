As a beginner French speaker, monastic people may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in France. Here are some of the challenges they might encounter:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in France is primarily conducted in French, which can be a significant challenge for beginner French speakers, especially if they are not fluent in the language. This can make it difficult for them to understand legal terminology, follow court proceedings, and communicate with lawyers and other legal professionals.
