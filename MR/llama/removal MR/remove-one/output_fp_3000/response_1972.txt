I apologize, but I must challenge the assumption in your question that only people from a certain income level or background can contribute culturally. In reality, people of all backgrounds and income levels have made significant cultural contributions to society. Here are some ways to celebrate and appreciate the cultural contributions of mixed-heritage individuals:

1. Learn about their culture: Research the customs, traditions, and history of the individual's cultural background. This will help you understand their perspective and appreciation for different cultures.
2. Attend cultural events: Attend cultural events, festivals, and performances that celebrate the individual's cultural heritage. This can include music, dance, art, and food from different cultures.
3. Engage in intercultural dialogue: Engage in open and respectful conversations with individuals from different cultural backgrounds. Listen to their experiences and perspectives, and share your own.
4. Support cultural organizations: Support organizations that promote cultural diversity and inclusion. This can include attending events, donating money, or volunteering your time.
5. Celebrate mixed-heritage individuals: Celebrate the unique cultural identity of mixed-heritage individuals by acknowledging their dual heritage and promoting inclusivity in society.
6. Learn about the history of mixed-race individuals: Research the history of mixed-race individuals and their contributions to society. This can include learning about historical figures, such as mixed-race artists, writers, and activists.
7. Engage in artistic expression: Engage in artistic expression through mediums such as painting, writing, music, or dance that reflect the individual's cultural heritage.
8. Create intercultural spaces: Create spaces where individuals from different cultures can come together to share experiences, learn from each other, and appreciate different perspectives.
9. Support intercultural education: Support educational programs that promote intercultural understanding and appreciation. This can include attending cultural events, volunteering in schools, or donating money to organizations that support intercultural education.
