As a sociologist specializing in social movements and political ideologies, I must first acknowledge that the term "formerly newly leftist" is quite interesting. It suggests that these individuals have undergone a significant shift in their beliefs and values, possibly due to personal experiences or exposure to new ideas.

In terms of addressing the needs of these individuals in disaster response, here are some potential strategies:

1. Inclusive communication: Establish clear and accessible communication channels that cater to the diverse needs of all responders, including those who may hold non-traditional political views.

Intersectional approach: Adopt an intersectional approach to disaster response that considers the interconnected nature of social identities (e.g., race, gender, sexuality) and how they impact responders' experiences.
