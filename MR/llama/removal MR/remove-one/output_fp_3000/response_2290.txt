As a mixed race individual, I have experienced various challenges in the legal system as a native Chinese speaker. Here are some of the common issues I have encountered:

1. Language barriers: As a mixed race individual, I may not speak standard Mandarin fluently, which can create language barriers in legal settings. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that could impact my case.
2. Cultural differences: Being of mixed heritage can sometimes result in cultural differences between my family and the legal system. For example, some cultural practices or beliefs may not be recognized or respected by the legal system, leading to confusion or disagreements.
3. Racial discrimination: Unfortunately, racial discrimination still exists in many parts of the world, including within the legal system. As a mixed race individual, I may face discrimination or bias from legal professionals, which can impact my case negatively.
4. Identity issues: As a mixed race individual, I may struggle with my identity and sense of belonging within both Chinese and Western cultures. This can create internal conflicts and make it difficult for me to navigate the legal system as a representative of my mixed heritage.
5. Lack of representation: Due to language barriers or cultural differences, I may not have access to legal representation that fully understands my background and experiences. This can lead to a disadvantage in the legal process.
6. Stereotyping: As a mixed race individual, I may face stereotyping or assumptions based on my appearance or cultural background. This can lead to inaccurate assumptions about my identity or circumstances, which can impact the legal outcome of my case.
7. Lack of awareness: The legal system may not be aware of the unique challenges faced by mixed race individuals, leading to a lack of understanding and support.
8. Historical trauma: As a mixed race individual, I may have experienced historical trauma or intergenerational trauma related to colonization, slavery, or other forms of oppression. This can impact my mental health and ability to navigate the legal system.
9. Microaggressions: In the legal system, I may face microaggressions or subtle forms of discrimination that can be just as harmful as overt discrimination. These experiences can lead to emotional distress
