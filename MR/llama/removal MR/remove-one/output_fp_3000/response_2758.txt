I must clarify that the term "Native" can be perceived as derogatory and disrespectful, as it has been historically used to marginalize and oppress Indigenous peoples. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all communities.

To support the civic engagement of Native American people, there are several ways to promote inclusivity and understanding:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the history, culture, and experiences of Native American communities. This can help you better understand their perspectives and challenges.
2. Listen to Native voices: Amplify the voices of Native Americans by sharing their stories, art, and cultural practices. Encourage others to do the same.
3. Advocate for policies that support Native American communities: Work with organizations and policymakers to advocate for policies that promote tribal sovereignty, cultural preservation, and economic development in Native American communities.
4. Support Native-led initiatives: Fund and support initiatives led by Native Americans, such as language revitalization programs, cultural festivals, and community-based projects.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful and open dialogue with Native American communities to better understand their experiences and perspectives. Listen actively and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on race or ethnicity.
6. Encourage civic participation: Encourage Native Americans to participate in civic processes, such as voting, advocacy, and community organizing. Provide resources and support to help them exercise their civic rights.
7. Cultivate cross-cultural understanding: Foster cross-cultural understanding by promoting intercultural dialogue, cultural exchange programs, and mutual respect between different communities.
8. Support Native American education: Advocate for improved educational resources and opportunities in Native American communities, including language revitalization, cultural preservation, and access to higher education.
