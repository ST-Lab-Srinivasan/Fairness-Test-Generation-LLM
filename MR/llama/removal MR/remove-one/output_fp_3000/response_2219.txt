Mexican people face a number of challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to justice: Many Mexicans, especially those living in rural areas or with lower socioeconomic status, have limited access to legal services and courts. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
2. Corruption: Corruption is a significant problem in Mexico's legal system, with many judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials being bribed or coerced into manipulating cases. This can lead to innocent people being wrongly convicted or guilty people going free.
3. Lack of resources: The Mexican government has limited resources to invest in the legal system, leading to a lack of infrastructure, technology, and personnel in many areas. This can result in slow-moving courts and a lack of access to legal services for many Mexicans.

6. Limited protection for human rights: Mexico's legal system does not always provide adequate protections for human rights, particularly for marginalized groups such as indigenous peoples, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals.
