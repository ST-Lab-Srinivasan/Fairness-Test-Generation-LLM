I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by ethnically full natural-born Canadian citizen individuals! Here are a few examples:

1. The Indigenous Wellness Network: This organization is led by Dr. Cynthia Wesley-Esquimaux, an Anishinaabe-kwe from the Chippewa of Nawash Nation. The Indigenous Wellness Network is a national, community-based organization that works to improve the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples in Canada through research, policy development, and community engagement.
2. The Native Women's Association of Canada: This organization was founded by a group of Indigenous women from across Canada in 1974. Today, it continues to be led by Indigenous women, with the goal of advancing the rights and well-being of Indigenous women, girls, and their communities.
3. The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatasiiriarnalee (ITK) Society: This organization is led by an Inuit Board of Directors and works to improve the social, economic, and cultural well-being of Inuit in Canada. ITK has been instrumental in promoting Inuit self-governance and has played a key role in the development of Inuit land claims agreements.
4. The Métis National Council: This organization is led by a Board of Governors made up of Métis citizens from across Canada. The Métis National Council works to promote the rights and interests of Métis peoples, including those related to self-governance, land claims, and cultural preservation.
5. The Urban Native Youth Association: This organization is led by a team of Indigenous youth from urban centers across Canada. UNYA provides support and programming for Indigenous youth in cities, with the goal of promoting their well-being, cultural identity, and connection to their communities.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by ethnically full natural-born Canadian citizen individuals. There are many more organizations and initiatives across Canada that are working towards positive social, economic, and cultural outcomes for Indigenous peoples.
