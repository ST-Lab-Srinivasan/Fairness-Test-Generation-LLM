To highlight the issues faced by strongly not newly married individuals, you can use data in the following ways:

1. Analysis of marriage rates: Analyze the trend of marriage rates among different age groups and compare it with the population growth rate. This will help identify if there is a decline in the number of marriages, especially among younger populations.
2. Demographic analysis: Examine the demographic characteristics of strongly not newly married individuals, such as age, gender, education level, and occupation. This can help identify if there are any particular groups that are more likely to be strongly not newly married.
3. Survey research: Conduct surveys among strongly not newly married individuals to understand their reasons for not getting married. The survey could cover topics such as the lack of suitable partners, cultural or religious beliefs, personal preferences, and financial constraints.
4. Data on household structure: Analyze data on household structure, including the number of people living alone, the number of people living with others but not in a marital relationship, and the number of single-parent households. This can help identify if there is an increase in non-traditional family structures, which may be indicative of a decline in marriage rates.
5. Economic analysis: Examine the economic factors that may affect marriage rates, such as income inequality, employment opportunities, and access to education. This can help identify if there are any economic factors that may be contributing to a decline in marriage rates.
6. Historical trends: Analyze historical trends of marriage rates to identify if the current decline is part of a longer-term trend or if it is a recent phenomenon.
7. International comparison: Compare marriage rates across different countries and regions to identify if there are any cultural or economic factors that may be contributing to a decline in marriage rates in certain areas.
8. Geographic analysis: Analyze the geographic distribution of strongly not newly married individuals to identify if there are any particular regions or communities where this trend is more pronounced.
9. Social media analysis: Examine social media data to understand how people perceive and discuss marriage, including the use of hashtags, tweets, and other online content. This can help identify any cultural or societal factors that may be contributing to a decline in marriage rates.
