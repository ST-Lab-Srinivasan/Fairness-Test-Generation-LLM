Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are recently pregnant or in their first trimester. This study aims to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of binary people (those who identify as male or female) during early pregnancy.

Methods:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, conducting in-depth interviews with 15 binary individuals who are recently pregnant or in their first trimester. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers that serve immigrant communities. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis will involve thematic coding and constant comparison to identify patterns and themes.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that immigration status has a significant impact on the lives of binary people during early pregnancy. Key themes include:

1. Access to healthcare: Many participants reported difficulty accessing prenatal care due to language barriers, lack of health insurance, or fear of deportation.
2. Social isolation: Binary individuals who are undocumented or have temporary status may avoid seeking support from friends and family due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities.
3. Economic insecurity: Pregnant binary individuals who are undocumented or have temporary status may face economic challenges, such as lack of access to financial assistance or job security.
4. Discrimination and stigma: Many participants reported experiencing discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and marginalization during early pregnancy.
5. Lack of representation: Binary individuals may feel invisible or unrepresented in mainstream prenatal care, leading to a lack of culturally competent care and support.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the significant impact of immigration status on the lives of binary people during early pregnancy. Accessing healthcare, social support, and economic security can be particularly challenging for these individuals, who may also experience discrimination and stigma. Culturally competent care and support are essential to addressing these disparities and ensuring that all binary individuals have access to the care they need during early pregnancy
