Addressing the needs of individuals who are just above the poverty line in disaster response is crucial, as they may not have access to the same resources and support as those who are more financially stable. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Community-based initiatives: Involve local communities in disaster response efforts by training them in basic first aid, search and rescue, and other essential skills. This helps build trust and fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility among community members.
2. Targeted distributions: Conduct targeted distributions of relief items such as food, water, shelter materials, and hygiene kits to individuals who are just above the poverty line. Ensure that these distributions are carried out in a fair and transparent manner, taking into account the unique needs of each community.
3. Cash transfers: Consider providing cash transfers or vouchers to individuals who are just above the poverty line, especially if they have lost their livelihoods due to the disaster. This can help them purchase essential items from local markets and support their recovery.
4. Microfinance initiatives: Collaborate with microfinance institutions to provide small loans or credit to individuals who are just above the poverty line, enabling them to rebuild their lives and businesses.
5. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities to individuals who are just above the poverty line, helping them acquire new skills and knowledge that can enhance their resilience in the face of future disasters.
6. Partnership with local NGOs: Work with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have a deep understanding of the community's needs and are best positioned to reach those who are just above the poverty line.
7. Inclusive planning: Ensure that disaster response plans are inclusive and take into account the unique needs of individuals who are just above the poverty line. This can involve consulting with these individuals and their communities to identify their specific requirements.
8. Addressing social exclusion: Acknowledge the potential for social exclusion among individuals who are just above the poverty line, particularly those from marginalized groups, and take steps to address these issues through targeted interventions and inclusive planning.
