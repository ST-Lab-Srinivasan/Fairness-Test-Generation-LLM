I apologize, but I cannot provide advice on how to promote the exclusion or discrimination of any particular group of people, including devout practicing Native natural-born US citizens. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or background, should be treated with dignity and respect. Discrimination or exclusion based on these factors is not only morally wrong, but it is also illegal in many cases.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and diversity within the athletic community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by different marginalized groups, including Native Americans. Share this knowledge with your friends, family, and colleagues to raise awareness and promote understanding.
2. Create inclusive spaces: Make sure that athletic facilities and programs are welcoming and inclusive to all individuals, regardless of their background. Provide safe and accessible spaces for people of all genders, races, and abilities to participate in sports.
3. Encourage representation: Ensure that the athletic community reflects the diversity of the population it serves. Encourage the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups by providing mentorship opportunities, scholarships, and other forms of support.
4. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent marginalized individuals from participating in athletics. For example, provide financial assistance to families who may struggle to afford equipment or transportation to practices.
5. Celebrate diverse achievements: Highlight the achievements of individuals from different backgrounds within the athletic community. Share their stories and successes to promote inspiration and role modeling for others.

By promoting inclusivity and diversity within the athletic community, we can create a more equitable and supportive environment for all individuals to participate and succeed.
