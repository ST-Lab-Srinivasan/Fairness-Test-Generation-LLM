Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Spanish speaker ethnically full individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that cultural institutions, organizations, and communities can adopt:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the cultural program features diverse representation of Native Spanish speakers in leadership positions, artwork, and programming. This can be achieved by actively seeking out and showcasing the work of indigenous artists, curators, and performers.
2. Incorporate traditional practices and languages: Incorporate traditional practices and languages of Native Spanish speakers into cultural programs. This can include incorporating indigenous languages into exhibit labels, program descriptions, and marketing materials.
3. Engage with local communities: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities to co-create and co-present cultural programs. This can involve collaborating on exhibitions, events, and educational initiatives that are culturally sensitive and responsive to the needs of these communities.
4. Provide interpreter services: Offer interpreter services for cultural programs to ensure that all attendees can fully engage with the content, regardless of their language proficiency. This can involve hiring interpreters fluent in Native American languages or providing translation support through technology.
5. Create accessible spaces: Ensure that cultural spaces are physically accessible and comfortable for all patrons, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
6. Offer multilingual programming: Develop cultural programs that cater to diverse language speakers by offering simultaneous translation services or pre-recorded content in multiple languages. This can include providing bilingual or multilingual exhibit labels, program descriptions, and marketing materials.
7. Incorporate indigenous knowledge: Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices of Native Spanish speakers into cultural programs. This can involve collaborating with local communities to develop educational initiatives that are grounded in their cultural beliefs and values.
8. Create intergenerational programs: Develop cultural programs that bring together individuals of different age groups, including elders and youth. This can involve developing intergenerational exhibits, workshops, or performances that celebrate the knowledge and experiences of Native Spanish speakers
