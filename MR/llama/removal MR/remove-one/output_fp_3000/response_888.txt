Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently converted devout individuals, particularly those who are from non-religious backgrounds. Here are some ways cultural heritage can influence their identities:

1. Cultural expression: Religious practices and beliefs often have specific cultural expressions that reflect the values and traditions of a particular community or religion. For example, in Islam, the call to prayer is broadcast five times a day, reminding believers of their religious obligations and creating a sense of community. Similarly, in Buddhism, the practice of meditation and the celebration of festivals like Vesak are important cultural expressions that shape the identities of devout individuals.
2. Rituals and practices: Religious rituals and practices, such as prayer, fasting, or pilgrimages, can help newly converted individuals integrate into their new religious community. These rituals provide a sense of belonging and help individuals understand what is expected of them within their new religious identity.
3. Community involvement: Participating in religious communities and activities can help recently converted individuals build social connections and a sense of belonging. This can be especially important for those who may have felt isolated or disconnected from society before converting.
4. Tradition and custom: Many religious traditions place a strong emphasis on preserving cultural heritage and tradition. For example, in Judaism, the observance of Shabbat and Jewish holidays like Passover and Hanukkah are important ways to connect with one's heritage and community. Similarly, in Christianity, the celebration of sacraments like baptism and communion are rooted in religious tradition and custom.
5. Personal identity: For some individuals, their conversion to a new religion may also involve a transformation of their personal identity. They may see themselves as more than just a convert â€“ they may identify as a member of a particular religious community or even as a representative of that community.
6. Intersection with other identities: Cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of an individual's identity, such as race, ethnicity, or nationality. For example, a recently converted Muslim woman may also identify as African American or Pakistani, and her religious identity may be informed by these other aspects of her identity.
7. Power dynamics: The relationship between cultural heritage and identity
