To address this, some women have formed support groups where they share their experiences, provide emotional support, and offer advice on navigating the challenges of pregnancy. These groups can be held in-person or online, depending on the preferences of the members.
2. Breastfeeding support: Many new mothers face difficulties breastfeeding, especially during the early stages.

To address this, some casual individuals have organized diaper drives to collect and distribute diapers to families in need. These drives can be organized through local non-profit organizations or directly within the community.
