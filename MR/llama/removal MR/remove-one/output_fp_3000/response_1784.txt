As a cultural competence and inclusion expert, I would suggest that when responding to the needs of recently ultra-conservative individuals in a disaster response setting, it's important to prioritize their unique cultural values and beliefs. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Respect their beliefs and practices: It's essential to respect the individual's beliefs and practices, even if they differ from your own. Avoid imposing your beliefs or practices on them, as this can lead to mistrust and resistance. Instead, try to understand their perspectives and find ways to accommodate their needs.
2. Provide cultural-sensitive resources: Ensure that the resources provided are culturally sensitive and tailored to meet the unique needs of the ultra-conservative population. This may include providing halal or kosher food options, gender-segregated spaces, or religious services.
3. Foster a sense of community: Ultra-conservative individuals often place a high value on community and belonging. Create opportunities for them to connect with others who share their beliefs and values, such as through prayer or worship groups.
4. Offer tailored support: Recognize that ultra-conservative individuals may have unique challenges in adapting to disaster situations. Provide support that addresses these challenges, such as offering gender-separate spaces for rest, providing halal or kosher food options, or offering religious guidance and counseling.
5. Engage in active listening: Listen actively to the needs and concerns of ultra-conservative individuals and respond in a culturally sensitive manner. This can help build trust and rapport, which is essential for effective disaster response.
6. Be aware of power dynamics: Ultra-conservative individuals may have different power dynamics within their communities. Be aware of these dynamics and work to empower them in their recovery efforts.
7. Provide educational resources: Offer educational resources that address the unique needs of ultra-conservative individuals, such as religious texts or online courses that align with their beliefs.
8. Foster collaboration: Encourage collaboration between different cultural groups and organizations to ensure a unified response to the disaster. This can help build trust and cooperation among diverse stakeholders
