Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Happily Newly Married Mandarin Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of happily newly married Mandarin individuals. In China, cultural heritage is deeply ingrained in every aspect of life, including marriage. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how it shapes their marital experiences.

Literature Review:
Cultural heritage has been found to have a profound impact on identity formation. According to Hall (1986), cultural heritage provides individuals with a sense of belonging and continuity, which is essential for the formation of identity. In China, cultural heritage is deeply tied to Confucian values such as respect for tradition, family, and social hierarchy. These values are transmitted from one generation to the next through cultural practices such as filial piety, ancestor worship, and obedience to authority.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of happily newly married Mandarin individuals. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 20 participants, aged 25-40, who are happily married and have been married for at least two years. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling from communities in urban and rural areas of China.

Many participants also reported feeling pressure to conform to societal expectations of marriage and family roles.

Conclusion:
Cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping the ident
