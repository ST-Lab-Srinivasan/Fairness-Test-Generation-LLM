Creating more inclusive public spaces for late teenagers (ages 18-19) can be achieved by designing spaces that are accessible, welcoming, and cater to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is wheelchair accessible, has ramps or elevators, and provides accessible restrooms. This will make the space more inclusive for individuals with disabilities.
2. Lighting and Wayfinding: Provide adequate lighting throughout the space to ensure visibility and safety, especially in areas that are less traversed. Use clear signage and wayfinding elements to help nominal individuals navigate the space easily.
3. Comfortable Seating: Incorporate comfortable seating options, such as benches or lounge chairs, throughout the space to provide areas for relaxation and socialization. This can be particularly important for nominal individuals who may feel uncomfortable in traditional public spaces.
4. Technology Integration: Consider incorporating technology such as charging stations, Wi-Fi access, or digital displays to make the space more inviting and functional for nominal individuals.
5. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that is inclusive of all age groups and abilities, such as art classes, book clubs, or sports leagues. This can help create a sense of community and belonging among late teenagers.
6. Flexible Spaces: Design spaces that can be adapted for different activities and events, such as outdoor movie screenings, concerts, or community meetings. This will allow nominal individuals to participate in various activities without feeling uncomfortable or excluded.
7. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve the needs of late teenagers, such as youth centers, schools, or mental health services. This can help create a more inclusive space and provide opportunities for nominal individuals to connect with their peers and access resources.
8. Access to Nature: Incorporate green spaces, parks, or gardens within the public space to provide opportunities for relaxation, recreation, and connection with nature. This can be particularly beneficial for nominal individuals who may struggle with sensory overload in traditional public spaces.
