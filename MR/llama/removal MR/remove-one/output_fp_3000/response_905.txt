A mentor can provide guidance, support, and valuable insights that help an individual navigate the complexities of political organizing and policy-making.

These connections can help democratic socialists build coalitions, access resources, and advance their goals more effectively.
3. Personal development: Mentorship can help democratic socialists develop their leadership skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. Mentors can provide constructive feedback, support, and guidance that helps mentees grow professionally and personally.
