Creating more inclusive community events for beginner, deeply lower-class people requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the challenges that prevent marginalized groups from participating in events. This could include lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or concerns about safety and inclusivity. Once you identify these barriers, develop solutions to address them.
2. Involve marginalized communities in planning: Include members of the community you want to target in the event planning process. This can help ensure that the event is tailored to their needs and preferences. Provide opportunities for them to contribute their ideas, insights, and perspectives.
3. Offer accommodations and support: Provide accommodations such as language interpretation, braille materials, or sign language interpretation to make the event more accessible. Offer support services like childcare, transportation, or respite care to help attendees who may need them.
4. Promote the event effectively: Use multiple channels to promote the event, including social media, flyers, and local newspapers. Reach out to community organizations and leaders to spread the word. Ensure that your promotional materials are accessible and inclusive, featuring images and language that reflect the diversity of the community.
5. Provide free or low-cost entry: Consider offering free or low-cost entry to the event to make it more accessible to those with limited financial resources. This can include sponsorships, grants, or crowdfunding campaigns.
6. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Ensure that your event space is physically accessible and free from discrimination. Provide clear instructions on how to access the space, and have staff available to assist attendees who may need help. Offer a variety of seating options and ensure that the event is scent-free to accommodate individuals with sensory sensitivities.
7. Offer culturally sensitive programming: Develop programming that reflects the cultural diversity of the community you are trying to reach. This could include music, dance, or art performances that showcase local talent and traditions. Provide food options that cater to a variety of dietary restrictions and preferences
