Creating more inclusive community programs for Native Spanish speakers as new immigrants requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural competency training for staff and volunteers: Provide training on the cultural norms, values, and beliefs of Native Spanish speaking communities to ensure that staff and volunteers can effectively interact with and support this population.
2. Language accessibility: Offer interpretation and translation services at community programs and events to ensure that all participants can fully engage and understand the content being provided.
3. Inclusive marketing and outreach: Develop marketing materials and outreach strategies that are tailored to the specific needs and preferences of Native Spanish speaking communities. Use language and imagery that is culturally relevant and inclusive.
4. Community-led programming: Involve members of the Native Spanish speaking community in the design and delivery of programs and services to ensure that they are culturally appropriate and responsive to their needs.
5. Flexible scheduling and locations: Offer programs and services at times and locations that are convenient for Native Spanish speakers, taking into account their work and family obligations.
6. Accessibility accommodations: Ensure that community programs and events are accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities, by providing reasonable accommodations such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, and audio descriptions.
7. Building partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and agencies that serve Native Spanish speaking communities to leverage resources, expertise, and networks.
8. Advocacy and policy changes: Work with advocates and policymakers to address systemic barriers and discrimination faced by Native Spanish speakers in the community, such as language barriers, lack of access to healthcare, and limited educational opportunities.
9. Capacity building: Provide training and resources to support Native Spanish speaking individuals in developing their leadership and advocacy skills, enabling them to take on more prominent roles in their communities.
10. Evaluation and feedback loops: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of community programs and services in reaching and serving Native Spanish speakers, and incorporate feedback from participants to make improvements and adjustments as needed.
