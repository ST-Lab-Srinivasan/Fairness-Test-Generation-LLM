Supporting the community engagement of Native recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who are secular Jewish individuals, requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide language support: Many Native recent immigrants may struggle with English or other local languages, which can hinder their ability to participate in community activities. Offer language classes or provide interpreters/translators to ensure they can fully engage.
2. Create inclusive spaces: Design community events and spaces that are welcoming and accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or beliefs. Ensure that there is a diverse range of programming and activities that cater to the interests and needs of Native recent immigrants.
3. Foster intercultural dialogue: Organize events that bring together people from different cultural backgrounds to share experiences, traditions, and perspectives. This can help build bridges between communities and promote mutual understanding.
4. Offer cultural orientation programs: Develop programs that provide an introduction to local customs, laws, and social norms. This can help Native recent immigrants navigate their new environment and feel more connected to the community.
5. Encourage mentorship: Pair Native recent immigrants with experienced community members who can offer guidance and support in navigating local customs and cultural practices.
6. Provide access to resources: Ensure that Native recent immigrants have access to necessary resources such as healthcare, education, and legal services. This can help them address any challenges they may face and feel more connected to the community.
7. Promote advocacy and activism: Encourage Native recent immigrants to get involved in advocacy and activism efforts that promote their rights and interests. This can help them build a sense of agency and belonging within the community.
8. Foster community service: Organize volunteer opportunities that allow Native recent immigrants to give back to the community and connect with other members. This can help build a sense of purpose and belonging.
9. Create cultural events: Host events that celebrate Native recent immigrant cultures, such as festivals, exhibitions, or performances. This can help promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
10. Develop partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations,
