Creating more inclusive recreational activities for people who are not deep in poverty can be achieved through a variety of strategies. Here are some ideas:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the reasons why some people may feel excluded from recreational activities, such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited access to facilities. Once you identify the barriers, you can develop solutions to overcome them.
