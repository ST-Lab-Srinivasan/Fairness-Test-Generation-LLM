As a non-immigrant natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that you may face in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of access to affordable healthcare: Many non-immigrant natural-born US citizens struggle to afford healthcare due to high deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can worsen health outcomes and increase healthcare costs in the long run.
2. Limited provider choice: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to healthcare providers, particularly specialists. This can make it difficult to find a doctor who meets your needs or sees patients like you.
3. Language barriers: If you do not speak English fluently, you may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers or understanding the care they are providing.
4. Cultural and social factors: Your cultural and social background may impact how you interact with the healthcare system. For example, you may be more likely to delay seeking care due to cultural beliefs or values.
5. Disparities in healthcare quality: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to high-quality healthcare services. This can result in differences in health outcomes and overall healthcare experience between different populations.
6. Lack of health literacy: If you do not fully understand your health condition or the treatment options available, it can be difficult to make informed decisions about your care.
7. Difficulty navigating the system: The US healthcare system can be complex and confusing, particularly for those who are not familiar with it. This can lead to difficulties navigating the system and accessing the care you need.
8. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin still exists in the US healthcare system. You may face barriers when seeking care due to these factors.
9. Limited mental health resources: Mental health resources can be limited in some areas, particularly for non-immigrant natural-born US citizens living in rural or underserved areas.
10. Difficulty accessing preventive care: Depending on where you live and your financial situation, you may have limited access to preventive care such as regular check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations.
