I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on a person's birthplace, citizenship, or social status. Every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances.

It is important to recognize that the concept of a "natural-born citizen elite" is often based on subjective and discriminatory criteria, such as wealth, privilege, and social connections. These factors do not determine a person's inherent worth or value, and they should not be used to justify treating some individuals better than others.

Instead, it is important to recognize that every person has unique perspectives and experiences to contribute to society, regardless of their background or circumstances. By valuing diversity and promoting inclusivity, we can create a more equitable and just society for all individuals.
