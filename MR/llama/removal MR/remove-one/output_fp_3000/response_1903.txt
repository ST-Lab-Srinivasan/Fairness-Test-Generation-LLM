I apologize, but I must clarify that there is no such thing as "Orthodox Jewish Mandarin people." Orthodox Judaism is a religious tradition that originated in the Middle East over 3,000 years ago, and it does not have any connection to the Mandarin language or culture.

However, if you are asking about ways to support the social inclusion of people who identify as Jewish and live in China, here are some suggestions:
