Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian individuals can be achieved by taking into consideration their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee represents a diverse range of cultures, ethnicities, ages, genders, and abilities. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and allow for a wider range of perspectives to be considered.
2. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations such as sign language interpreters, braille materials, or audio descriptions for individuals with disabilities. This will enable them to fully participate in the celebration.
3. Make the event accessible: Ensure that the venue is accessible to individuals with mobility impairments by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
4. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups. Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and identities.
5. Highlight diverse cultural traditions: Showcase the unique cultural practices and traditions of different communities, such as traditional music, dance, art, or food. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and allow individuals to learn about and appreciate different cultures.
6. Involve community members: Encourage community members to participate in the planning process by sharing their ideas and suggestions for the celebration. This will help create a sense of ownership and belonging among community members.
7. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials or workshops that provide information on different cultures, traditions, and histories. This will help create a more informed and empathetic atmosphere during the celebration.
8. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage individuals to share their experiences and perspectives with one another, fostering a sense of mutual respect and understanding.
9. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Avoid cultural appropriation or misrepresentation by being sensitive to the cultural practices and traditions of different communities.
10. Evaluate and improve: After the celebration, evaluate what worked well and what didn't, and make improvements for future events. This will help create a more inclusive and respectful atmosphere for all participants.
