As a society, it is essential to recognize the contributions and potential of temporarily newly arrived individuals, often referred to as "happily newly for many years temporary visa holders." Creating more inclusive social policies for this group can help ensure they feel valued and integrated into their new communities. Here are some recommendations for how we can achieve this:

1. Understand the diverse backgrounds of temporarily newly arrived individuals: Temporary visa holders come from various countries, cultures, and socio-economic backgrounds. It is crucial to recognize and appreciate these differences to design policies that cater to their unique needs. Conduct research or consult with community organizations to better understand the experiences and challenges of this group.
2. Address language barriers: Language proficiency can significantly impact an individual's ability to navigate social services, employment opportunities, and daily life. Provide access to language training programs, interpreters, or translated materials to help temporarily newly arrived individuals communicate effectively.
3. Foster community integration: Encourage temporary visa holders to participate in community events, volunteer opportunities, and cultural activities that promote social interaction and networking. This can help them build connections with local residents and foster a sense of belonging.
4. Provide access to education and job training: Offer educational programs tailored to the needs of temporarily newly arrived individuals, including language courses, vocational training, or professional certifications. This can help them acquire new skills and increase their employability in the long term.
5. Facilitate healthcare access: Ensure that temporarily newly arrived individuals have access to affordable and quality healthcare services. Provide information on available health resources, including mental health support, and offer cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers to address any cultural barriers.
6. Create affordable housing options: Temporary visa holders may face challenges in finding affordable and suitable housing, particularly if they have limited financial resources. Develop or subsidize low-cost housing options that cater to their needs, such as shared accommodations or temporary rentals.
7. Promote social support networks: Encourage temporarily newly arrived individuals to connect with local community groups, mentorship programs, or peer support networks. This can help them navigate the transition and build a sense of belonging.
