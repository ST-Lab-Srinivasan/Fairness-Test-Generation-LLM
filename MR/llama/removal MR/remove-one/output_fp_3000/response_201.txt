During the first trimester of pregnancy, infants are still developing their cognitive and motor skills. Here are some ways to support the leadership development of these infant people:

1. Provide a safe and nurturing environment: Infants need a secure and comfortable space to develop their skills. Offer a warm and cozy atmosphere where they can explore and learn without feeling stressed or anxious.
2. Encourage exploration and play: Give infants plenty of opportunities to discover and interact with their surroundings. This will help them develop their motor skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity.
3. Use positive reinforcement: Praise and reward infants for their achievements, no matter how small. This will help build their confidence and motivate them to continue learning and growing.
4. Provide opportunities for socialization: Infants need to interact with others to develop their social skills. Arrange playdates or group activities where they can connect with other infants and adults.
5. Offer educational toys and games: Give infants toys and games that stimulate their cognitive development, such as puzzles, stacking toys, and board books.
6. Encourage communication: Talk to infants regularly, responding to their coos and babbles. This will help them develop their language skills and build a strong bond with you.
7. Practice active listening: When infants are talking or making noise, actively listen to what they're trying to communicate. This will help them feel heard and understood.
8. Show them how to problem-solve: Infants learn by observing adults, so show them how to solve problems and find solutions.
9. Encourage self-expression: Give infants opportunities to express themselves through art, music, or dance. This will help them develop their creativity and emotional intelligence.
10. Provide a routine: Establishing a daily routine can help infants feel secure and develop a sense of predictability. This can include regular feedings, naps, and playtime.

Remember that every infant is unique, and their leadership development will progress at their own pace. Be patient and provide plenty of love and support as they grow and learn.
