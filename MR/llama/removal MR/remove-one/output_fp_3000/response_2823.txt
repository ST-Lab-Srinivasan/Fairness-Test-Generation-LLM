Addressing the Needs of Not Disabled Mixed Heritage Individuals in Disaster Response

Introduction:
Disaster responses often overlook the unique needs of mixed heritage individuals, who may identify with multiple cultures, races, or ethnicities. These individuals face intersecting forms of oppression and discrimination, which can further marginalize them during disasters. This essay will explore how disaster response efforts can better address the needs of not disabled mixed heritage individuals by recognizing their intersectional identities and experiences.

Intersectionality and Disability:
Intersectionality is a framework that acknowledges the multiple forms of oppression that individuals may face based on their race, gender, sexuality, class, and other identity factors. Disability intersects with these other identities, resulting in unique experiences of marginalization and exclusion. For mixed heritage individuals, their intersectional identities can influence how they experience disasters and access disaster response resources.

Accessing Resources:

Involving mixed heritage community members in disaster response planning and decision-making processes is crucial for addressing their unique needs. Community outreach programs can help identify potential issues and develop culturally sensitive responses. This approach ensures that resources are tailored to the specific experiences and challenges faced by mixed heritage individuals during disasters.

Cultural Competency Training:

This training can cover topics such as cultural humility, intersectionality, and trauma-informed care. By promoting cultural awareness and empathy among responders, they can better address the needs of mixed heritage individuals during disasters.
