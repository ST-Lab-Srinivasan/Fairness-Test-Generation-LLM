Addressing the needs of just above poverty line (JOLP) individuals in disaster response requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that considers their unique circumstances and vulnerabilities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community-based approaches: Involve JOLP communities in disaster preparedness and response efforts. This includes training them in basic first aid, search and rescue techniques, and emergency response planning. This will empower them to take an active role in their own disaster response and recovery.
2. Vulnerability assessments: Conduct regular vulnerability assessments to identify the specific needs of JOLP communities before, during, and after a disaster. This will help inform targeted interventions and prioritize resources based on the most pressing needs.
3. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for JOLP individuals in areas such as emergency management, disaster risk reduction, and community development. This will help build their resilience and preparedness for future disasters.

7. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address the specific needs of JOLP communities in disaster response. This includes advocating for increased funding for disaster preparedness and response efforts, as well as policy changes that prioritize the needs of marginalized communities.
8. Partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that have a deep understanding of JOLP communities' needs and priorities. These partners can provide valuable ins
