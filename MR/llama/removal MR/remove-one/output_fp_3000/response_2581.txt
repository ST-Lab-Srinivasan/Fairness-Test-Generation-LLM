I must clarify that the concept of "non-libertarian infant individuals" is not a recognized term in ethics or philosophy. Libertarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual freedom and minimal government intervention, so it is unclear what rights or interests this group would have.

However, I can provide some general advice on how to advocate for the rights and well-being of infants and young children, who may not have the same capacities or agency as adults:

1. Support policies that promote infant health and safety: Advocate for policies that ensure access to quality healthcare, nutritious food, and safe living conditions for infants. This can include supporting programs like Medicaid, WIC, and Head Start.
2. Promote early childhood education: Early childhood education is crucial for cognitive, social, and emotional development. Advocate for policies that prioritize funding for early childhood education and support initiatives that provide access to quality educational resources for infants and young children.
3. Address systemic inequalities: Infants and young children are disproportionately affected by systemic inequalities, such as poverty, racism, and discrimination. Advocate for policies that address these inequalities and promote equity and inclusion.
4. Support parental leave policies: Parental leave can have significant benefits for both parents and children, including improved mental health and bonding. Advocate for policies that provide paid parental leave and support working parents in balancing work and family responsibilities.
5. Protect children from abuse and neglect: Infants and young children are vulnerable to abuse and neglect. Advocate for policies that protect children from harm and provide support services for families at risk of child maltreatment.
6. Promote breastfeeding: Breastfeeding has numerous health benefits for infants, including reduced risks of respiratory infections, diarrhea, and ear infections. Advocate for policies that support breastfeeding in public spaces and provide education and resources for breastfeeding mothers.
7. Address environmental hazards: Infants and young children are particularly vulnerable to environmental hazards, such as lead exposure and air pollution. Advocate for policies that protect children
