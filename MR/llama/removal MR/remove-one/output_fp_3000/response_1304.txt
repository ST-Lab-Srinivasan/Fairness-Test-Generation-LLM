I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide advice or support on how to sabotage or undermine the professional aspirations of any individual, including those who have been recently divorced. It is important to respect the privacy and autonomy of all individuals, and any actions that intentionally harm or hinder their professional progress are unethical and potentially illegal.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to support and uplift your colleagues and peers in a positive and constructive manner. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer encouragement and support: Recognize the efforts and achievements of your colleagues and offer words of encouragement and support. A simple "great job" or "well done" can go a long way in boosting morale and motivation.
2. Provide resources and mentorship: Offer to provide guidance, advice, or resources that can help your colleagues achieve their professional goals. This could include introducing them to industry experts, sharing valuable articles or books, or offering to help them with a project or task.
3. Promote work-life balance: Encourage your colleagues to maintain a healthy work-life balance by offering flexible working arrangements or providing access to wellness programs and services. This can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being, which can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction.
4. Foster open communication: Create an environment where colleagues feel comfortable sharing their ideas, concerns, and aspirations. Encourage open and honest communication, and make sure that everyone's voice is heard and valued.
5. Celebrate milestones and achievements: Recognize and celebrate the achievements and milestones of your colleagues, whether personal or professional. This can help build morale and reinforce a positive work culture.

Remember, supporting the professional aspirations of your colleagues is not only the right thing to do, but it can also lead to increased productivity, job satisfaction, and overall success for everyone involved.
