I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to this question as it is a complex and sensitive topic that requires a nuanced understanding of the legal system, social inequality, and cultural context. However, I can provide some general insights based on available information.

Lower-class Mexican people may face various challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Lower-income individuals may not have access to legal aid organizations or private attorneys, which can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
2. Language barriers: Many lower-class Mexican people may not speak Spanish fluently, which can create challenges when interacting with legal professionals who often only speak Spanish.
3. Lack of knowledge about legal procedures: Lower-class individuals may be unfamiliar with the legal system and its processes, making it difficult for them to navigate the system effectively.
4. Discrimination: Lower-class Mexican people may experience discrimination in the legal system based on their socioeconomic status, which can affect their ability to access justice.
5. Limited representation: Lower-class individuals may have limited access to legal representation, which can result in unequal treatment under the law.
6. Lack of trust: Lower-class Mexican people may not trust the legal system or law enforcement agencies due to historical and ongoing issues of corruption and abuse of power.
7. Fear of retaliation: Lower-class individuals who seek legal recourse may fear retribution from powerful actors, such as employers or community leaders, which can limit their ability to access justice.
8. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Lower-class Mexican people may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation or arbitration, which can limit their ability to resolve disputes outside of the courts.
9. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system may not be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of lower-class Mexican people, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscarriages of justice.
10. Limited access to specialized services: Lower-class Mexican people may have limited access to specialized services, such as legal clinics or advocacy organizations, which can limit their ability to access justice.

It is important to note that these challenges are complex
