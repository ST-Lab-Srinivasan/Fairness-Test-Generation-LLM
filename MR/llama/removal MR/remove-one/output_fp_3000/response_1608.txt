The Nigerian healthcare system faces several challenges that affect the well-being of native Nigerians. Some of the major challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities and services, particularly in rural areas. Many Nigerians living in rural areas have limited or no access to basic healthcare services such as maternal and child healthcare, immunization, and emergency care.
2. Brain drain: Many skilled healthcare professionals, including doctors and nurses, emigrate from Nigeria due to the lack of opportunities and infrastructure, leading to a shortage of qualified healthcare workers.
3. Limited availability of essential medicines and medical supplies. The country's healthcare system often faces challenges in procuring and distributing essential medicines and medical supplies, particularly in remote areas.
4. Inadequate funding: The Nigerian government invests less than 1% of its GDP in the healthcare sector, which is significantly lower than the recommended minimum of 5% by the World Health Organization (WHO). This results in a lack of resources and infrastructure for healthcare delivery.
5. Corruption and mismanagement: The country's healthcare system is often plagued by corruption and mismanagement, which leads to inefficient allocation of resources and poor service delivery.
6. Limited awareness and education about healthy behaviors and disease prevention. Many Nigerians have limited access to health education and promotion materials, which can contribute to a lack of knowledge about healthy behaviors and disease prevention.
7. Cultural beliefs and practices that affect healthcare: Some cultural beliefs and practices in Nigeria may conflict with modern medical practices, such as the use of traditional medicine and the preference for home births over hospital deliveries.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Many Nigerians do not have access to specialized medical care, particularly in rural areas, due to a lack of specialists and specialized facilities.
9. Inadequate infrastructure: The country's healthcare infrastructure is often inadequate, with many hospitals and clinics lacking basic amenities such as electricity, water, and sanitation.
10. Conflict and political instability: Nigeria has faced conflict and political instability in recent years,
