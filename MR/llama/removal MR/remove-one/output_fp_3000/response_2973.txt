Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term unemployed and recently unemployed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of unemployment and provides support for these individuals to reintegrate into the workforce. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Address the skills gap: Many long-term unemployed individuals may lack the skills and training necessary to compete in today's job market. Governments can provide funding for vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and adult education courses that help individuals acquire new skills and certifications.
2. Provide job placement services: Governments can establish job placement agencies or partner with private sector companies to provide job seekers with access to job listings, interview preparation, and career counseling. These services can help individuals identify suitable job opportunities and improve their chances of getting hired.
3. Offer mentorship programs: Experienced professionals can act as mentors to recently unemployed individuals, providing guidance on job search strategies, networking, and professional development. Mentorship programs can help individuals build confidence and connections in their desired field.
4. Support entrepreneurship: Encouraging entrepreneurship can create new opportunities for self-employment and job creation. Governments can provide funding, training, and resources to support startups and small businesses founded by unemployed individuals.

Promote flexible work arrangements: Offering flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, part-time work, or freelance opportunities can help individuals balance work and family responsibilities while they get back on their feet. Employers can also provide career breaks or sabbaticals to help employees recharge and return to the workforce more refreshed and motivated.
6. Address discrimination: Discrimination based on race, gender, age, or other factors can prevent individuals from finding employment. Governments can implement policies that promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace, such as anti-discrimination laws and targeted hiring initiatives.
