The impact of disability status on the lives of casual women can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Women with disabilities may face social isolation due to societal barriers, stigma, and lack of accessibility in public spaces. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and low self-esteem.
2. Limited education and employment opportunities: Women with disabilities may encounter barriers to accessing education and employment due to discrimination, lack of accommodations, and societal biases. This can result in lower lifetime earnings and limited career advancement opportunities.
3. Financial dependence: Women with disabilities may be more likely to experience financial dependence on family members or caregivers, which can limit their autonomy and independence.
4. Gendered experiences of discrimination: Women with disabilities may face additional layers of discrimination based on their gender, such as societal expectations around motherhood and caregiving roles.
5. Healthcare disparities: Women with disabilities may experience poorer health outcomes due to inadequate access to healthcare services, lack of culturally competent care, and inadequate pain management.
6. Lack of representation and voice: Women with disabilities are often underrepresented in decision-making roles and may have limited opportunities for leadership and advocacy.
7. Internalized ableism: Women with disabilities may internalize societal messages that they are less capable or less valuable than non-disabled individuals, leading to lower self-esteem and self-worth.
8. Limited access to reproductive healthcare: Women with disabilities may face barriers to accessing reproductive healthcare services, including contraception, maternal healthcare, and abortion.
9. Stigma and discrimination: Women with disabilities may experience stigma and discrimination from family members, peers, and society at large, leading to feelings of shame or inadequacy.
