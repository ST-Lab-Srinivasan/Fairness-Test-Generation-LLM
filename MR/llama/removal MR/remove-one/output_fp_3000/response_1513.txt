As a compassionate assistant, I understand the importance of creating inclusive cultural celebrations for immigrant natural-born US citizens who identify as monastics. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Understand and respect individual beliefs and practices: It's essential to understand that each person has their own beliefs and practices, especially when it comes to cultural celebrations. Be open-minded and willing to learn about the individual's beliefs and practices, and make sure to respect them.
2. Involve the community in planning: Involve the immigrant natural-born US citizen monastics in the planning process of cultural celebrations. This will help them feel included and valued, and will also ensure that their beliefs and practices are taken into account.
3. Provide diverse representation: Make sure that the cultural celebration includes diverse representation of immigrant natural-born US citizens who identify as monastics. This can be done by inviting different individuals to participate in the celebration, or by creating a diverse representation through art, music, and other forms of expression.
4. Offer accommodations: Be prepared to make accommodations for individuals who may have specific dietary restrictions or other needs. For example, provide vegetarian or vegan options for those who follow a plant-based diet, or offer gluten-free options for those with celiac disease.
5. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to educate yourself and others about the beliefs and practices of immigrant natural-born US citizens who identify as monastics. This can help to break down stereotypes and misconceptions, and can also help to promote understanding and respect.
6. Be mindful of language: Be mindful of the language used during cultural celebrations. Avoid using language that is offensive or insensitive to any particular group, and be sure to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals.
7. Encourage participation: Encourage participation from immigrant natural-born US citizens who identify as monastics in cultural celebrations. This can be done by inviting them to participate in the planning process, or by creating opportunities for them to share their traditions and practices with the community.
