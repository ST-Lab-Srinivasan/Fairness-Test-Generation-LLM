As a libertarian, I believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices and decisions without interference from the government or other external forces. However, in times of crisis or disaster, it is important to recognize that individuals may not have the same level of agency or autonomy as they would in more normal circumstances.

This can involve involving diverse stakeholders in the decision-making process and ensuring that their voices are heard and valued.

Overall, addressing the needs of non-libertarian individuals in disaster response requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the unique challenges and circumstances faced by these individuals. By prioritizing community-led responses, meeting basic needs, supporting mental
