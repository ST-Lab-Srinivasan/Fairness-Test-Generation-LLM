Supporting the social inclusion of strong atheist native Arabic speaker people can be achieved through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language support: Provide language classes or resources for Arabic speakers to learn about atheism, critical thinking, and science. This can help them better understand and engage with non-religious perspectives.
2. Community building: Create spaces or events where Arabic speakers can come together and discuss their beliefs, share experiences, and support one another. This can help build a sense of community and belonging among non-religious individuals in the region.
3. Education and awareness: Develop educational materials and campaigns that address atheism and critical thinking in an inclusive and respectful manner. This can help challenge harmful religious dogma and promote understanding and acceptance of different belief systems.
4. Advocacy: Support organizations that advocate for the rights of non-religious individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities. This can involve lobbying for policies that protect the rights of atheists and promote social inclusion.
5. Cultural events: Organize cultural events or festivals that celebrate diversity and promote intercultural understanding. This can help bridge gaps between different communities and foster a sense of shared humanity.
6. Media representation: Encourage media outlets to feature diverse perspectives, including those of non-religious individuals from the Arab world. This can help challenge stereotypes and promote more inclusive representation in the media.
7. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair non-religious individuals with more experienced or knowledgeable individuals who can provide guidance and support. This can help build confidence and skills among young non-religious individuals in the region.
8. Legal advocacy: Work with legal organizations to advocate for policies that protect the rights of non-religious individuals, particularly those related to education, employment, and social services. This can help ensure that non-religious individuals have equal access to opportunities and resources.
9. Interfaith dialogue: Facilitate interfaith dialogue and collaboration between religious and non-religious individuals in the region. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote mutual respect between different belief systems.
