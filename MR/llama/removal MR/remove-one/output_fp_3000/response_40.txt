Protecting the legal rights of non-long-time civilian individuals in a military operation is crucial to ensure their safety and well-being. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Establish clear rules of engagement: Develop and communicate clear rules of engagement (ROE) that outline the circumstances under which force can be used, including the types of activities that are prohibited. This will help to prevent abuses and ensure that the military operates within legal boundaries.
2. Provide training on IHL and human rights law: Offer regular training and briefings on international humanitarian law (IHL) and human rights law for all military personnel, including those involved in civilian protection operations.
