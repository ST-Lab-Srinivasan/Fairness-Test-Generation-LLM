Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent immigrants to Canada, particularly for those who are ethnically diverse. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation within a particular culture or group of people. For immigrants, cultural heritage can provide a sense of identity and belonging, as well as a connection to their ancestral roots.
