Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of children in lower middle-income countries. These conditions can affect a child's physical, mental, and social development, leading to various challenges and difficulties for the child and their family. In this report, we will explore the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of children in lower middle-income countries and identify potential solutions to address these challenges.

Impacts of Genetic Conditions on Children's Lives:

1. Physical Disabilities: Genetic conditions can result in physical disabilities such as musculoskeletal problems, visual or hearing impairments, or other mobility issues. These disabilities can limit a child's ability to participate in activities and access educational resources, leading to social isolation and stigma.
2. Mental Health Issues: Genetic conditions can also lead to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, or bipolar disorder. These conditions can significantly impact a child's ability to cope with the challenges of growing up in a lower middle-income country, leading to increased stress and hardship for the family.
3. Social Stigma: Genetic conditions often result in social stigma, which can lead to discrimination and marginalization of the child and their family. This can limit the child's access to education, healthcare, and other resources, further exacerbating the challenges they face.
4. Economic Burden: Genetic conditions can also result in significant economic burdens for families, particularly those in lower middle-income countries. The costs of medical care, rehabilitation, and specialized education can be prohibitively expensive, leading to financial strain and hardship.
5. Limited Access to Healthcare: In many lower middle-income countries, access to healthcare is limited, particularly for children with genetic conditions. This can result in delayed or inadequate medical care, exacerbating the impact of the condition on the child's development and well-being.

Potential Solutions:

1. Early Intervention and Support: Providing early intervention and support to children with genetic conditions can significantly improve their outcomes. This includes access to medical care, rehabilitation services, and specialized
