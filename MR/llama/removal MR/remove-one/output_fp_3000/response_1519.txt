The role of family support in the success of Native American natural-born US citizens with no known genetic conditions is significant. Family support can provide emotional, social, and cultural capital that can help individuals navigate challenges and achieve their goals. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to the success of Native American individuals:

1. Emotional Support: Growing up as a Native American can be challenging, particularly when facing discrimination and marginalization. Having a strong support system within one's family can provide emotional validation and comfort during difficult times. Family members can offer emotional support by listening, providing advice, and being a shoulder to cry on.
2. Cultural Preservation: Native American culture is rich and diverse, but it has been marginalized and oppressed throughout history. Having a strong family support system can help preserve cultural traditions and practices, such as language, music, and spirituality. Family members can pass down cultural knowledge and practices to younger generations, ensuring the continuation of cultural heritage.
3. Social Capital: Native American communities are often under-resourced and face significant barriers to success. Having a strong family support system can provide access to social capital, such as networks of influential individuals, resources, and opportunities. Family members can help navigate these networks and provide access to resources that might not be available otherwise.
4. Networking: Native American families often have close-knit networks of relatives, friends, and community members who can provide support and connections. These networks can be valuable in navigating challenges such as accessing education, employment, and healthcare. Family members can help facilitate these connections and provide opportunities for growth and development.
5. Historical Trauma Healing: Native American communities have experienced significant historical trauma, including forced relocation, cultural suppression, and violence. Having a strong family support system can help individuals heal from this trauma by providing emotional validation, cultural continuity, and a sense of belonging. Family members can help facilitate healing processes and provide ongoing support for mental health and well-being.
6. Role Modeling: Growing up as a Native American can be challenging, particularly when facing discrimination and marginalization. Having positive role models within one's family can provide inspiration and motivation to overcome these challenges.
