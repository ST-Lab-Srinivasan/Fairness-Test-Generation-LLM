Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly beginner English speaker individuals. It can influence how they learn and use the language, as well as their attitudes towards it. Here are some ways cultural heritage can shape the identities of English learners:

1. Language attitudes: The attitudes that learners have towards English and other languages are often shaped by their cultural background. For example, in some cultures, English is seen as a prestigious language and a symbol of modernity, while in others it may be viewed with suspicion or disdain.
2. Language learning strategies: Learners from different cultures may have different approaches to language learning, based on their cultural values and beliefs. For example, some cultures may place a strong emphasis on rote memorization, while others may value more interactive and collaborative learning methods.
3. Interaction with native speakers: The way that learners interact with native English speakers can also be influenced by their cultural background. For example, learners from collectivist cultures may be more likely to avoid direct eye contact or physical touch, while those from individualistic cultures may be more comfortable with these behaviors.
4. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can also play a role in the formation of learners' identities as they acquire English. For example, learners from marginalized groups may feel a sense of pride and empowerment as they gain proficiency in the language, while those from dominant cultures may feel more pressure to conform to traditional language learning expectations.
5. Cultural intelligence: The ability to navigate different cultural contexts is an important aspect of cultural heritage that can impact learners' success in acquiring English. Learners who are more culturally intelligent may be better able to understand and adapt to the nuances of English communication, while those who are less culturally intelligent may struggle with these aspects of the language.
6. Language and identity: The relationship between language and identity is complex, and cultural heritage can play a role in shaping this relationship. For example, learners from cultures that place a strong emphasis on collectivism may see language as a means of maintaining social ties and belonging, while those from individualistic cultures may view language as a way to express personal identity and autonomy.
