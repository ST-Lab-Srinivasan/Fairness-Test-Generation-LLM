To highlight the issues faced by non-wealthy, natural-born US individuals using data, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Income inequality analysis: Use data from reputable sources such as the US Census Bureau or the Federal Reserve to analyze the growing wealth gap between the rich and poor in the US. Create visualizations and reports that illustrate how the top 1% of earners are pulling away from everyone else, and how this is affecting the overall economy.
2. Housing affordability analysis: Use data on housing prices, income, and other factors to demonstrate how unaffordable housing has become for many people in the US. Create maps and reports that show the areas where housing is most expensive and where it is becoming increasingly difficult for low-income families to find affordable housing.
3. Educational attainment analysis: Use data on educational outcomes, such as high school graduation rates and college enrollment, to demonstrate how certain groups of people are being left behind in terms of educational opportunities.

Create visualizations and reports that show the disparities in employment outcomes between different racial and socioeconomic groups.
7. Wealth accumulation analysis: Use data on wealth holdings, inheritance, and other factors to demonstrate how non-wealthy individuals are struggling to accumulate wealth. Create visualizations and
