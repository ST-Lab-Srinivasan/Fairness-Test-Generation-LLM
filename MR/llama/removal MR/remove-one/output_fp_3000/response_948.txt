Creating more inclusive social policies for Nigerian devout individuals requires a deep understanding of their beliefs, practices, and cultural context. Here are some recommendations to promote greater inclusion and respect for their religious practices:

1. Consultation and Collaboration: Engage in consultative processes with religious leaders and community members to better understand their needs and priorities. This will help policymakers develop policies that reflect the diverse perspectives of Nigeria's religious populations.
2. Promote Interfaith Dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and collaboration among different religious groups to promote mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation. This can be done through organized events, conferences, or community-based initiatives.
3. Respect Religious Freedom: Ensure that the rights of Nigerian devout individuals are protected and respected, including their freedom to practice their religion without fear of persecution or discrimination.
4. Address Discrimination: Take steps to address discrimination against religious minorities, including those based on their religious beliefs or practices. This can be done through education and awareness campaigns, as well as legal protections against discrimination.
5. Inclusive Education: Ensure that education policies and programs are inclusive of Nigerian devout individuals' beliefs and practices. This can be achieved by providing religious education options, accommodating prayer times and holidays, and promoting cultural sensitivity in the curriculum.
6. Economic Empowerment: Promote economic empowerment programs that target religious minorities, including access to credit, entrepreneurship training, and job creation initiatives. This can help reduce poverty and inequality, which are often exacerbated by discrimination based on religion.
7. Healthcare Access: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and inclusive of Nigerian devout individuals' beliefs and practices. This can be achieved by providing culturally sensitive healthcare services, accommodating prayer times and dietary restrictions, and promoting religious literacy among healthcare providers.
8. Social Protection: Develop social protection policies that address the specific needs of religious minorities, including access to insurance, pension plans, and other forms of financial support. This can help reduce poverty and inequality, and promote greater social inclusion.
