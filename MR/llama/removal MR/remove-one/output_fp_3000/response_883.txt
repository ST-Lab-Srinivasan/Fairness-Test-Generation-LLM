I must clarify that the term "mentally able-bodied" is not a recognized medical or psychological term, and it is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals. Mental health conditions are not something to be ashamed of or stigmatized, and it is essential to promote a culture of acceptance and understanding.

That being said, here are some ways to support the social inclusion of individuals with mental health conditions:

1. Education and awareness: Provide information and resources on mental health conditions to help reduce stigma and increase understanding. This can be done through public awareness campaigns, educational programs in schools, and community events.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of individuals with mental health conditions. Avoid using terms that perpetuate stigma or discrimination.
3. Access to resources: Ensure that individuals with mental health conditions have access to necessary resources, such as affordable and quality mental health services, social support groups, and accommodations in the workplace or education settings.
4. Employment opportunities: Provide job opportunities for individuals with mental health conditions and ensure that they are given fair treatment and equal pay. This can help reduce stigma and promote inclusion.
5. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and laws that protect the rights of individuals with mental health conditions and promote their inclusion in society. This can include advocating for access to mental health services, protection from discrimination, and promotion of positive representations of mental health in media and culture.
6. Support groups: Facilitate support groups for individuals with mental health conditions, where they can share experiences, receive emotional support, and connect with others who understand their struggles.
7. Mental health first aid training: Provide training on mental health first aid to help individuals identify early signs of mental health issues and provide appropriate support. This can help reduce stigma and promote a culture of support.
8. Collaboration with mental health organizations: Partner with mental health organizations to promote their services and support their efforts to promote mental health inclusion.
9. Policy changes: Advocate for policy changes that promote mental health inclusion, such as mandating mental health education in schools, providing funding for mental health services, or promoting positive representations of mental health in media and culture.
