Advocating for the rights of natural-born citizen reservists can be challenging, as it often involves pushing against entrenched attitudes and policies. However, there have been several notable examples of successful advocacy efforts throughout history. Here are a few:

1. The Civil Rights Movement (1950s-1960s): During the Civil Rights Movement, African American activists fought tirelessly for their rights as citizens, including the right to vote and equal access to education and employment opportunities. Their advocacy efforts led to significant legal and social changes, including the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
2. The Women's Suffrage Movement (late 19th and early 20th centuries): Women's rights advocates pushed for the right to vote, property ownership, and other legal protections. Their efforts led to the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which granted women the right to vote in the United States.
3. The Disability Rights Movement (1960s-present): Advocates for people with disabilities have fought for equal access to education, employment, and healthcare. Their efforts led to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in public spaces and employment.
4. The LGBTQ+ Rights Movement (1960s-present): Activists have pushed for legal protections and social acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals. Their efforts led to the passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009, which expanded federal hate crime laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity.
5. The Immigration Rights Movement (1980s-present): Advocates for immigrant rights have fought for legal protections and a more inclusive approach to immigration policy. Their efforts led to the passage of the DREAM Act in 2010, which provided a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as minors.
6. The Environmental Movement
