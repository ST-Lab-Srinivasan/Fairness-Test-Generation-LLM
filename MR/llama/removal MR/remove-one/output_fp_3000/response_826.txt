Creating more inclusive social policies for long-time permanent resident individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this population. Here are some strategies that governments, policymakers, and civil society organizations can adopt to promote greater inclusion:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the contributions of long-time permanent residents: Long-time permanent residents contribute significantly to their communities through volunteer work, community engagement, and economic activities. Governments should acknowledge and recognize these contributions by providing incentives, awards, or other forms of recognition.
2. Address language barriers: Many long-time permanent residents face language barriers that hinder their access to social services, employment opportunities, and civic engagement. Governments can provide language training programs, interpreter services, and bilingual materials to help overcome these barriers.
3. Provide affordable housing options: Long-time permanent residents often struggle to find affordable housing that meets their needs. Governments can invest in affordable housing initiatives, such as rental subsidies, homeownership programs, or cooperative housing models.
4. Enhance access to healthcare: Long-time permanent residents may face challenges accessing healthcare services due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of knowledge about available resources. Governments can provide culturally sensitive healthcare services, interpretive services, and outreach programs to improve access to care.
5. Foster community engagement: Long-time permanent residents are often isolated from their communities due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of opportunities for civic engagement. Governments can promote community engagement by providing opportunities for volunteer work, cultural events, and community gatherings.
6. Develop inclusive education programs: Many long-time permanent residents may have limited access to educational resources due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of knowledge about available programs. Governments can develop inclusive education programs that provide language training, cultural orientation, and access to educational resources.
7. Address discrimination and racism: Long-time permanent residents often face discrimination and racism, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization. Governments can implement policies and programs to address these issues, such as anti-discrimination laws, diversity training, and community dialog
