Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Term Native French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have grown up speaking a language and living in a culture for an extended period.
