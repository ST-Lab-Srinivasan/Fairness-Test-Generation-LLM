The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who are not recently immigrants can be significant and far-reaching. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face barriers to social participation, including discrimination, stigma, and lack of access to social activities and events. This can lead to social isolation and loneliness, which can have negative effects on mental health and overall well-being.
2. Employment limitations: Many people with disabilities may face barriers to employment, including discrimination, inaccessible workplaces, and lack of accommodations. This can limit their ability to fully participate in the workforce and achieve economic independence.
3. Healthcare disparities: People with disabilities may experience poorer health outcomes than non-disabled individuals due to lack of access to appropriate healthcare services, discrimination, and stigma. This can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, exacerbating existing conditions or leading to new ones.
4. Housing challenges: People with disabilities may face barriers to accessing and maintaining affordable, accessible housing, including lack of availability, inaccessible design, and discrimination. This can lead to homelessness or suboptimal living situations.
5. Education disparities: Students with disabilities may face barriers to accessing and succeeding in education, including lack of accommodations, stigma, and discrimination. This can result in lower educational attainment and socioeconomic outcomes.
6. Transportation limitations: People with disabilities may face barriers to transportation, including inaccessible vehicles, public transportation systems, and lack of transportation options. This can limit their ability to access employment, healthcare, and social activities.
7. Criminal justice disparities: People with disabilities may be at higher risk of encountering the criminal justice system due to discrimination, stigma, and inaccessible facilities. This can result in poorer outcomes and increased likelihood of poverty and homelessness.
8. Political marginalization: People with disabilities may face barriers to political participation, including lack of accessibility in voting systems, limited representation in government, and discrimination. This can result in lower levels of political influence and
