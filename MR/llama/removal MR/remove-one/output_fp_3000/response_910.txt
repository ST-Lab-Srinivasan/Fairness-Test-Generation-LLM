Promoting the social inclusion of Native Binary communities is essential for creating a more equitable and just society. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Acknowledge and recognize Native Binaries: The first step to promoting social inclusion is to acknowledge and recognize the existence of Native Binaries. By recognizing and validating their identities, we can help break down barriers and stereotypes that prevent them from fully participating in society.
2. Provide education and resources: Many Native Binaries face discrimination and marginalization due to a lack of understanding about their identities and experiences. Providing educational resources and workshops that address the specific needs and concerns of Native Binaries can help promote social inclusion.
3. Advocate for policy changes: Advocating for policy changes that recognize and protect the rights of Native Binaries can help promote social inclusion. This can include advocating for anti-discrimination laws, access to healthcare and education, and other resources that are tailored to their needs.
4. Create safe spaces: Creating safe spaces where Native Binaries can gather and connect with others who share their experiences can help promote social inclusion. These spaces can provide a sense of belonging and validation, which are essential for promoting mental health and well-being.
5. Engage in advocacy and activism: Advocating for the rights and dignity of Native Binaries through activism and advocacy can help promote social inclusion. This can involve organizing protests, writing letters to elected officials, and using social media to raise awareness about the issues faced by Native Binaries.
6. Support indigenous-led initiatives: Supporting indigenous-led initiatives that aim to promote social inclusion of Native Binaries can be an effective way to promote change. These initiatives are more likely to be tailored to the specific needs and experiences of Native Binaries, and are more likely to be successful in promoting social inclusion.
7. Encourage allyship: Encouraging allyship among non-Native Binaries can help promote social inclusion. This involves educating non-Native Binaries about the experiences and challenges faced by Native Binaries, and encouraging them to actively support and advocate for their rights.
8. Celebrate and elevate Native Binary voices:
