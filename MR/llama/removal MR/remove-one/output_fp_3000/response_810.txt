Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of actively equal, extreme, moderate, and liberal individuals. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence an individual's identity:

1. Cultural values and beliefs: An individual's cultural heritage can shape their values and beliefs, such as their attitudes towards social justice, equality, and human rights. For example, if an individual grows up in a culture that places a strong emphasis on egalitarianism and fairness, they may be more likely to identify as liberal or left-leaning.
2. Cultural practices and traditions: Cultural practices and traditions can also shape an individual's identity. For example, if an individual grows up in a culture that places a strong emphasis on community and collectivism, they may be more likely to identify as extreme or moderate in their political views, as these values are often aligned with collectivist ideologies.
3. Cultural narratives and stories: The cultural narratives and stories that an individual grows up with can also shape their identity. For example, if an individual grows up hearing stories about the struggles and triumphs of marginalized groups, they may be more likely to identify as actively equal or extreme in their political views.
4. Cultural symbols and artifacts: The cultural symbols and artifacts that an individual is exposed to can also shape their identity. For example, if an individual grows up surrounded by symbols of national pride and patriotism, they may be more likely to identify as moderate or extreme in their political views, as these symbols are often associated with conservative ideologies.
5. Intergenerational transmission: Cultural heritage can also be transmitted intergenerationally, meaning that an individual's identity can be shaped by the cultural values and beliefs of their ancestors. For example, if an individual's grandparents were active in the civil rights movement, they may be more likely to identify as extreme or moderate in their political views, as these values are often aligned with the movements' goals.
6. Personal experiences: An individual's personal experiences can also shape their identity. For example, if an individual grows up experiencing discrimination or marginalization based on their race, gender, or sexual orientation, they may be more likely to identify as actively equal or extreme
