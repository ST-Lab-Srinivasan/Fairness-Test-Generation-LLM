Supporting the economic empowerment of Native American recent immigrants to the US who are long-term unemployed requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Job training and placement programs: Provide job training and placement services specifically tailored to the needs of Native American recent immigrants. This could include language training, cultural competency training, and vocational training in high-demand fields such as healthcare, technology, and renewable energy.
2. Mentorship and networking opportunities: Connect recent immigrants with successful Native American professionals and entrepreneurs who can serve as mentors and role models. This could help build confidence and provide valuable connections that can lead to job opportunities.
3. Access to capital: Many recent immigrants face barriers in accessing capital for starting a business or investing in education. Provide access to affordable loans, grants, and other financial resources to support entrepreneurship and career development.
4. Addressing systemic barriers: Native American recent immigrants often face discrimination and bias in the job market. Work with employers to address these issues through training and policy changes that promote inclusivity and diversity.
5. Community-based initiatives: Develop community-based initiatives that provide support and resources for recent immigrants, such as language classes, cultural events, and job fairs. These initiatives can help build a sense of community and connection to the local economy.
6. Collaboration with tribal governments: Work with tribal governments to develop programs and policies that support economic empowerment for Native American recent immigrants. This could include partnerships in areas such as job training, education, and small business development.
7. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels that promote inclusivity and diversity in the job market. This could include changes to immigration laws, labor laws, and education policies that address the unique needs of Native American recent immigrants.
8. Leveraging technology: Utilize technology to provide remote access to job training and placement services, as well as financial resources and mentorship opportunities. This can be particularly helpful for rural communities with limited access to these resources
