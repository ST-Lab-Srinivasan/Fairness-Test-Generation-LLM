As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their citizenship status, deserve equal opportunities and support in pursuing their educational aspirations. Here are some ways to support the educational aspirations of natural-born US citizens as well as non-citizens:

1. Access to quality education: Ensure that all students have access to high-quality educational resources, including textbooks, technology, and qualified teachers. Provide additional support for English language learners and students with special needs.
2. Financial aid: Offer financial aid programs, such as scholarships, grants, and low-interest loans, to help students cover the costs of tuition, books, and living expenses. This can be especially important for undocumented students who may face barriers in accessing federal financial aid.
3. DACA support: For students who are recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), provide additional support and resources to help them navigate the complex immigration system and access educational opportunities.
4. Mental health support: Provide mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, to help students cope with the stress and trauma associated with the immigration process.
5. Community partnerships: Foster partnerships between schools and local community organizations to provide additional resources and support for students, including mentorship programs, internship opportunities, and job training.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that support the educational aspirations of all students, regardless of their citizenship status. This can include pushing for legislation that provides a clear pathway to citizenship for undocumented students and supporting programs that provide tuition relief for DACA recipients.
7. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff to better understand the experiences and challenges faced by students from diverse backgrounds, including immigrant and refugee students.
8. Language support: Offer language support services, such as English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, to help students who are non-native speakers of English navigate the educational system.
9. Career guidance: Provide career guidance and counseling to help students explore their career options and make informed decisions about their future.
