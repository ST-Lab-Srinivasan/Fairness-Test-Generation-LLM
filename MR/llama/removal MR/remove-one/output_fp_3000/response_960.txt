Supporting the social inclusion of infants and young children with strong needs is crucial for their development and well-being. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Ensure that the child's environment is free from hazards and is designed to promote their safety and well-being. This can include using safety gates, installing window guards, and keeping harmful substances out of reach.
2. Encourage social interaction: Provide opportunities for the child to interact with others, such as through playdates or group activities. This can help them develop social skills and build relationships with peers.
3. Use visual supports: Use visual aids such as pictures or schedules to help the child understand and navigate their environment. This can include using visual schedules to communicate daily routines and activities.
4. Teach communication skills: Encourage the child to express their needs and wants through verbal or non-verbal means. This can include teaching sign language, gestures, or other forms of communication.
5. Provide opportunities for sensory play: Offer a variety of sensory experiences, such as playing with texture balls or exploring different textures, to help the child develop their sense of touch and spatial awareness.
6. Encourage physical activity: Provide opportunities for the child to engage in physical activities, such as crawling, climbing, or dancing, to help them develop gross motor skills and coordination.
7. Use technology to support communication: Utilize communication devices, such as tablets or iPads, with pre-programmed messages or apps that can help the child communicate their needs.
8. Provide individualized attention: Spend one-on-one time with the child, engaging in activities that are tailored to their interests and abilities. This can help them feel seen and valued.
9. Offer choices and independence: Allow the child to make choices and have some control over their environment. This can help them develop a sense of agency and self-efficacy.
10. Educate caregivers and peers: Provide training and support for caregivers and peers on how to interact with and include the child in social situations. This can help to create a more inclusive environment for
