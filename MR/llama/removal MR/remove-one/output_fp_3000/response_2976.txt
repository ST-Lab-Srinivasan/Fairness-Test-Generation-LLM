Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term unemployed and recently unemployed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of unemployment and provides support for these individuals to reintegrate into the workforce. Here are some suggestions:

1. Job Training and Education Programs: Provide job training and education programs that cater to the needs of long-term unemployed individuals. These programs should focus on developing skills that are in demand in the labor market, such as digital literacy, communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.
2. Mentorship and Coaching: Pair recently unemployed individuals with experienced professionals who can provide mentorship and coaching. This can help them build their confidence and gain valuable insights into the job market.
3. Networking Opportunities: Organize networking events and workshops that bring together employers, job seekers, and career experts. This can help recently unemployed individuals connect with potential employers and learn about new job opportunities.
4. Wellness Support: Offer wellness support services, such as counseling and mental health resources, to help individuals cope with the emotional challenges of unemployment.
5. Childcare and Transportation Support: Provide childcare and transportation support to help individuals who may face additional barriers to employment, such as parents or those living in remote areas.
6. Flexible Work Arrangements: Encourage employers to offer flexible work arrangements, such as part-time or remote work, to help recently unemployed individuals reintegrate into the workforce on their own terms.
7. Income Support: Provide income support, such as a basic income or a negative income tax, to help individuals who are struggling financially due to long-term unemployment.
8. Housing Support: Offer housing support services, such as rent assistance or homeownership programs, to help individuals who may face housing insecurity due to unemployment.
9. Employer Partnerships: Develop partnerships with employers who are committed to hiring and retaining individuals from underrepresented groups. This can help create a more inclusive work environment and provide job opportunities for long-term unemployed individuals.
