Introduction:
Language plays a crucial role in shaping the identity of individuals, including older adults. As people age, their language use can reflect changes in their cognitive, social, and cultural contexts. This essay will explore the role of language in the identity of very old (90s+) people, examining how it influences their sense of self and their interactions with others.

Language and cognition:
As people age, their cognitive abilities can decline, which can impact their language use. Older adults may experience difficulties with memory, attention, and processing speed, leading to errors in grammar, syntax, and vocabulary (Hindmarch & Flickinger, 2013). This can result in a more limited and simpler language use, which can affect how they express themselves and interact with others. For example, older adults may rely more on filler words, such as "um" or "ah," to bridge gaps in their thinking (Bock & Levelt, 1990).

Social isolation:
Older adults may experience social isolation due to various factors, including the death of spouses and friends, declining health, and reduced mobility. Social isolation can lead to a decrease in language use, as older adults may have fewer opportunities to engage in conversations and interact with others (Tomasello, 2003). This can result in a more restricted language repertoire and a reduced ability to express themselves in social situations.

Cultural influences:
Language is shaped by cultural norms and values, which can change over time. Older adults may have grown up speaking a particular language or dialect that is no longer prevalent in their community or society (Katz & Rygel, 2015). This can lead to difficulties with language use and communication, particularly if they are not exposed to the new language or dialect regularly.

Interaction with others:
Language plays a crucial role in how older adults interact with others. They may use language to negotiate relationships, establish social roles, and maintain social connections (Tomasello, 2003). Older adults may also rely on language to express their emotions, desires, and needs, as well as to seek help or support from others
