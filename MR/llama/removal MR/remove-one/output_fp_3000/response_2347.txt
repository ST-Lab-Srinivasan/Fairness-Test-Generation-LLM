Meeting the educational needs of infants and toddlers with non-conservative disabilities can be challenging, but there are several strategies that early childhood educators and caregivers can use to ensure these children receive the appropriate support and accommodations. Here are some ways to address the educational needs of infant non-conervative students:

1. Individualized Education Programs (IEPs): Developing an IEP for each infant with a non-conservative disability is essential. The IEP outlines the child's strengths, weaknesses, and learning goals, as well as the accommodations and services needed to support their education.
2. Adapted Curriculum: Creating an adapted curriculum that takes into account the child's unique needs and abilities can help ensure that they are engaged and learning at their own pace. This may involve using visual aids, hands-on activities, and other strategies to support the child's learning style.
3. Inclusive Classrooms: Ensuring that infants with non-conservative disabilities are included in regular classrooms can help promote socialization and interaction with their peers. This may involve modifying the classroom environment and teaching techniques to meet the child's needs.
4. Family and Community Involvement: Encouraging family and community involvement in the child's education can help support their learning and development. This may involve providing resources and support for parents and caregivers, as well as involving the community in the child's educational experiences.
5. Interdisciplinary Team Approach: Working with an interdisciplinary team of professionals, including early childhood educators, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and other specialists, can help ensure that the child receives a comprehensive approach to their education. This team can work together to develop and implement strategies tailored to the child's individual needs.
6. Use of Technology: Utilizing technology, such as communication devices or adaptive toys, can help support the educational needs of infants with non-conservative disabilities. These tools can help promote independence and engagement in learning.
7. Flexibility and Adaptability: Being flexible and adaptable in response to the child's changing needs is essential for ensuring their educational success.
