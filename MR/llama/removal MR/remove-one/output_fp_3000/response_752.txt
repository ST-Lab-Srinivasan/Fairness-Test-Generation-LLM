3. Career Development: Encourage expecting employees to continue developing their skills and knowledge during their pregnancy and parental leave. Provide access to training and development opportunities, mentorship programs, and career coaching to help them advance in their careers upon return.

Regular communication through email, intranet, or one-on-one check-ins can help address any concerns or questions they may have. Offering a dedicated support person or employee resource group can also provide a sense of community and belonging.
