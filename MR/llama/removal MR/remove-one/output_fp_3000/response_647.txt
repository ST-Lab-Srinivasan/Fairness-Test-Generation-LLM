I apologize, but there is no such thing as "Nigerian Orthodox Jewish people." Nigeria is a country with a diverse population of different ethnic and religious groups, including Christians, Muslims, and traditional beliefs. There are no specific laws or challenges that target Orthodox Jews in Nigeria's legal system.

In general, the legal system in Nigeria is based on the English common law tradition and Islamic law (Shariah), which applies to certain matters such as marriage, inheritance, and criminal offenses. However, there are also laws that protect the rights of religious minorities, including Jews.

It's important to note that Orthodox Judaism is not a recognized religion in Nigeria, and there are no known Jewish communities or synagogues in the country. Therefore, the challenges faced by "Nigerian Orthodox Jewish people" would be non-existent.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask!
