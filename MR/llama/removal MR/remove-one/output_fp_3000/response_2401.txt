Non-upper-class mixed-heritage individuals face a range of challenges within the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not be trained to understand and address the unique needs of mixed-heritage patients, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Language barriers: Mixed-heritage individuals may face language barriers due to their parents speaking different languages, which can hinder communication with healthcare providers.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Mixed-heritage individuals may experience stigma and discrimination within the healthcare system, particularly if they are perceived as not belonging to a particular racial or ethnic group.
4. Difficulty accessing care: Mixed-heritage individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to factors such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited mobility.
5. Health disparities: Mixed-heritage individuals may experience health disparities due to a lack of culturally competent healthcare services, leading to poorer health outcomes compared to their monoracial counterparts.
6. Difficulty navigating systems: Mixed-heritage individuals may face challenges in navigating the healthcare system, particularly if they have multiple identities or experiences that do not fit into traditional categories.
7. Limited representation: Mixed-heritage individuals may have limited representation within the healthcare system, leading to a lack of understanding and recognition of their specific needs and experiences.
8. Stereotyping and assumptions: Healthcare providers may make assumptions about mixed-heritage individuals based on their appearance or identity, leading to inaccurate diagnoses or inappropriate care.
9. Lack of culturally sensitive resources: Mixed-heritage individuals may have limited access to culturally sensitive healthcare resources, such as interpreters, cultural competency training, or language-specific materials.
10. Internalized oppression: Mixed-heritage individuals may internalize the oppression they face within the healthcare system, leading to lowered self-esteem, self-efficacy, and overall well-being.

Addressing these challenges requires a commitment to cultural competence, language access, and inclusive care
