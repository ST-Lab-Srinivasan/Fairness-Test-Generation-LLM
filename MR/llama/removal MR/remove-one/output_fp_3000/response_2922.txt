Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Ethnically Full Non-Conservative Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full non-conservative individuals. This group is characterized by their rejection of traditional cultural norms and values, while still embracing their ethnic identity. Understanding the impact of cultural heritage on these individuals can provide valuable insights into the complexities of identity formation and social change.

Theoretical Framework:
This study will employ a critical race theory framework to examine how cultural heritage shapes the identities of ethnically full non-conservative individuals. This theoretical approach recognizes the intersectionality of identity and the ways in which race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other factors intersect to produce unique experiences of marginalization and oppression.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using interviews and focus groups to collect data from ethnically full non-conservative individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media outreach, ensuring a diverse sample of individuals with different backgrounds and experiences. Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Research Questions:

1. How do ethnically full non-conservative individuals perceive their cultural heritage in relation to their identity?
2. What role does cultural heritage play in shaping the identities of ethnically full non-conservative individuals?
3. How do factors such as race, gender, and sexuality intersect with cultural heritage to produce unique experiences of marginalization and oppression?
