Creating more inclusive cultural events for pregnant individuals, including those in their first trimester who may identify as partly asexual, requires understanding and accommodating the unique needs of this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (e.g., "mothers" vs. "fathers") and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of parental roles, such as "caregivers" or "parents."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is wheelchair accessible and has amenities for individuals who may need them due to their pregnancy. This could include designated breastfeeding areas, comfortable seating, and easily accessible food and drink options.
3. Accommodations for privacy: Respect the privacy of individuals who may not want to disclose their pregnancy status or who may be in their first trimester and still adjusting to their new identity. Provide private areas for nursing or pumping breastmilk, if needed.
4. Education and representation: Include diverse representations of pregnant individuals in your cultural events, such as those from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, abilities, and genders. Offer educational resources and workshops that address the unique needs and experiences of pregnant individuals, including those who identify as partly asexual.
5. Safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment for all attendees, including pregnant individuals. Establish clear guidelines and protocols for respecting people's boundaries and privacy, especially during events that may involve physical touch or intimacy.
6. Inclusive programming: Offer cultural events and activities that cater to the diverse needs and interests of pregnant individuals, such as prenatal yoga classes, breastfeeding support groups, or workshops on reproductive health and wellness.
7. Communication and marketing: Clearly communicate the inclusivity of your events through your marketing materials and website. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities, and ensure that your promotional materials are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
8. Partner with organizations: Collaborate with
