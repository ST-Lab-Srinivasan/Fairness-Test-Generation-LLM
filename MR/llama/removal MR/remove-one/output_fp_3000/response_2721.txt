They believe that these practices are essential to maintaining social order and cohesion.

Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and identity, which is critical in shaping their social and political views.
3. Respect for authority: Mandarin small-government advocates have a deep respect for authority and tradition, which is rooted in their cultural heritage.
