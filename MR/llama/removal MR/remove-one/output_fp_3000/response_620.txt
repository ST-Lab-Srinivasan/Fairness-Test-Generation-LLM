Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner Arabic speakers requires careful consideration of the needs and preferences of this group. Here are some suggestions on how to design such programs:

1. Offer a variety of learning methods: Beginner Arabic speakers may have different learning styles, such as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. Provide a range of learning materials, including textbooks, audio recordings, and interactive activities, to cater to these different styles.
2. Use inclusive language: When designing program materials, avoid using language that may be offensive or alienating to non-native speakers. Use language that is respectful and inclusive, and provide explanations and examples that are relevant to the learners' cultural backgrounds.

8. Offer tailored courses: Beginner Arabic speakers may have different levels of proficiency or focus on specific areas of the language, such as reading, writing,
