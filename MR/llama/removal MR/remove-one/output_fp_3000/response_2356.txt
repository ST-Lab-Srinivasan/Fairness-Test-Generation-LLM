To support the economic empowerment of not just individuals above the poverty line, but also ethnic minorities and marginalized communities, there are several strategies that can be implemented:

1. Access to Education and Training: Providing access to quality education and training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market and access better-paying jobs. This is particularly important for ethnic minorities and marginalized communities who may face barriers to accessing education and training opportunities.
