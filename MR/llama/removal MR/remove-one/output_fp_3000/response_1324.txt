Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers are heard in decision-making processes is crucial to promote inclusivity and diversity. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginner English speakers. This will help them improve their language skills and gain confidence in expressing themselves.
2. Use interpreters or translators: When conducting meetings or decision-making processes, consider hiring interpreters or translators to facilitate communication between non-native English speakers and the rest of the group.
3. Encourage participation: Create a safe and inclusive environment where beginner English speakers feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Encourage them to participate in discussions and decision-making processes, and provide support and guidance as needed.
4. Develop a mentorship program: Pair beginner English speakers with more experienced individuals who can provide guidance and support in navigating the language and cultural barriers.
5. Provide feedback and support: Offer regular feedback and support to beginner English speakers to help them improve their communication skills and build confidence in expressing themselves.
6. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to help beginner English speakers understand complex concepts and ideas, which can be difficult to explain in spoken language alone.
7. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage the entire group to be mindful of the needs of beginner English speakers and create an environment where everyone feels valued and heard.
8. Provide accessible communication channels: Ensure that there are multiple communication channels available, such as written notes or messages, to accommodate different learning styles and preferences.
9. Set clear expectations: Establish clear expectations and guidelines for communication and decision-making processes to avoid confusion or misunderstandings.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the cultural and linguistic diversity of the group by celebrating and recognizing the contributions of beginner English speakers. This can help build their confidence and encourage them to continue participating in decision-making processes.

By implementing these strategies, you can create an inclusive environment where the voices of beginner English speakers are heard and valued for a long time.
