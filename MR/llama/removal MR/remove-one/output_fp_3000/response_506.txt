As an AI language model, I cannot give a definitive answer to this question as it is based on a false assumption that "ultra-native French speaker people" exist. There is no scientific or linguistic basis for such a concept, and it is not a recognized term in the field of linguistics or any other discipline.

Furthermore, the idea of an "ultra-native" language speaker is problematic because it implies that there are multiple levels of native-ness, which is not supported by empirical evidence. Language proficiency and native-like abilities are complex constructs that depend on a variety of factors, including genetics, upbringing, education, and cultural background.

In the legal system, people's language proficiency and ability to communicate effectively can affect their interactions with legal professionals and the courts. However, it is not accurate to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their language abilities or cultural background.

Instead, it is important to recognize that individuals have different strengths, weaknesses, and communication needs, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background. Legal professionals and the courts should strive to provide equal access to justice for all individuals, regardless of their linguistic or cultural background.
