Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of late teenagers (18-19 years old). These conditions can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their physical health, mental wellbeing, social interactions, and educational or career opportunities. Here are some common impacts of genetic conditions on late teenagers:

1. Physical limitations: Many genetic conditions can cause physical limitations that may affect a person's ability to perform daily activities, participate in sports or other physical activities, or even lead a normal life. For example, individuals with muscular dystrophy may experience muscle weakness and fatigue, while those with cerebral palsy may have difficulty with mobility and coordination.
2. Mental health concerns: Genetic conditions can also increase the risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This is often due to the emotional burden of living with a chronic condition, social isolation, or stigma associated with their condition.
3. Social isolation: Late teenagers with genetic conditions may face social isolation due to feelings of embarrassment, shame, or fear of rejection from peers and society. This can lead to a lack of social interaction and support, which can further exacerbate mental health issues.
4. Educational challenges: Genetic conditions can impact an individual's ability to learn and retain information, leading to academic struggles and reduced opportunities for educational advancement. Additionally, late teenagers with genetic conditions may need to take time off from school due to illness or hospitalizations, which can further hinder their academic progress.
5. Career limitations: Depending on the severity of the genetic condition, individuals may face limitations in their career choices or have reduced opportunities for employment. This can lead to financial instability and independence issues later in life.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, many people with genetic conditions still face stigma and discrimination from society, which can further affect their mental health and wellbeing. Late teenagers may experience social exclusion or bullying due to their condition, leading to reduced self-esteem and confidence.
7. Family dynamics: Genetic conditions can impact the entire family dynamic,
