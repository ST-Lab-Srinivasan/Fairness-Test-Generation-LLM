Ensuring the healthcare needs of active-duty military personnel aged over 85 (known as "older adults" in medical terminology) can be challenging due to various factors, including limited access to healthcare resources and specialized care. However, there are several strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Age-friendly healthcare systems: Implement age-friendly healthcare systems that prioritize the unique needs of older adults. This includes training healthcare providers in geriatrics and age-related care, designing clinical workflows that cater to older adults' cognitive and functional limitations, and leveraging technology to facilitate access to care.
2. Care coordination: Ensure seamless care coordination between various healthcare providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, and allied health professionals. This can be achieved through regular communication, shared clinical summaries, and the use of electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate information sharing.
3. Chronic disease management: Older adults often have multiple chronic conditions that require ongoing management. Develop comprehensive care plans for these patients, focusing on preventive care, early detection of complications, and targeted interventions to manage symptoms and slow disease progression.
4. Telemedicine and remote monitoring: Utilize telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies to bridge the gap in access to healthcare services for older adults living in remote or rural areas. This can include virtual consultations, remote patient monitoring, and the use of wearable devices to track vital signs and other health metrics.
5. Palliative care: Provide palliative care services to help older adults manage their symptoms, improve their quality of life, and address their emotional and spiritual needs. This includes early integration of palliative care into the treatment plan for patients with advanced illnesses or those nearing the end of life.
6. Home-based care: Offer home-based care services to older adults who may prefer to receive care in a familiar environment. This can include home healthcare, hospice care, and supportive care services that help them maintain their independence and quality of life.
7. Family engagement: Encourage family members or caregivers to participate in
