3. Voting rights advocacy: Advocate for policies that protect and expand access to voting, such as automatic voter registration, same-day registration, and online registration.
4. Get-out-the-vote (GOTV) campaigns: Organize efforts to encourage registered voters to cast their ballots on election day.
5. Candidate forums and debates: Host events where candidates can discuss their platforms and engage with voters, promoting informed decision-making.
6. Voter guide publications: Create resources that provide information on candidates, issues, and voting processes, helping voters make informed decisions.
7. Community outreach: Engage with local communities, listen to their concerns, and provide support for their civic engagement efforts.
8. Intergenerational dialogue: Facilitate conversations between older and younger generations to ensure that diverse perspectives are represented in the political process.
9. Promote media literacy: Educate individuals on how to critically evaluate sources of information and news, helping them make informed decisions based on factual content.
10. Advocate for electoral reform: Work towards improving the voting system and reducing barriers to participation, such as gerrymandering, voter ID laws, and partisan election interference.
