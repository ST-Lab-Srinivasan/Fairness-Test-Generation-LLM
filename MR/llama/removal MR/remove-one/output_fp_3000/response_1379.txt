Family support plays a significant role in the success of seeking employment for casual workers. Here are some ways in which family support can influence the success of job seekers:

1. Emotional Support: Having the backing and encouragement of family members can help job seekers stay motivated and positive during the job search process. Family support can provide a sense of security and stability, which can be particularly important for casual workers who may face uncertain employment arrangements.
