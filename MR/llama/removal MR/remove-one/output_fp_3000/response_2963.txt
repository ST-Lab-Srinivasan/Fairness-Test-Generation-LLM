Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are experiencing deep poverty requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and provides support for these individuals to break the cycle of poverty. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Address systemic issues: Poverty is often a result of systemic issues such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources. Policymakers must address these underlying issues through policies that promote equity and inclusion.
2. Increase access to education and job training: Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge needed to secure better-paying jobs and improve their socio-economic status.
3. Implement a living wage policy: Ensuring that workers are paid a living wage can help them meet their basic needs and reduce the risk of poverty. This can be achieved through policies such as minimum wage laws, housing subsidies, and other forms of economic support.
4. Provide mental health services: Poverty can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health, leading to conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Providing access to mental health services can help individuals manage these challenges and improve their overall well-being.
5. Offer childcare support: Many individuals experiencing deep poverty struggle to afford quality childcare, which can limit their ability to work or seek employment opportunities. Policies that provide affordable childcare options can help alleviate this burden and promote greater economic mobility.
6. Implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI): A UBI is a type of social policy that provides a guaranteed income to all individuals, regardless of their employment status. This can help reduce poverty by providing a safety net and allowing individuals to focus on finding employment or pursuing education and job training.
7. Address housing affordability: Housing affordability is a significant challenge for many individuals experiencing deep poverty. Policies that provide affordable housing options, such as rent control or subsidized housing, can help reduce the burden of housing costs and improve overall well-being.
8. Provide healthcare support: Ensuring access to quality healthcare is essential for promoting better health out
