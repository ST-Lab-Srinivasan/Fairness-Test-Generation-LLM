As a beginner speaker and recent immigrant to the United States, navigating the legal system can be a daunting task. Here are some of the common challenges faced by these individuals:

1. Lack of familiarity with the language and culture: The legal system in the US is based on common law, which can be quite different from the legal systems in other countries. As a result, beginner speakers may struggle to understand the terminology and procedures used in the US legal system. Additionally, the cultural norms and values that underpin the legal system can also be unfamiliar to recent immigrants.
2. Limited access to resources: Many recent immigrants may not have access to the same resources as native-born citizens, such as legal aid organizations or free or low-cost legal clinics. This can make it more difficult for them to access legal assistance and navigate the system.
3. Difficulty navigating complex procedures: The US legal system has many complex procedures and rules that can be challenging for beginner speakers to navigate. For example, understanding how to file a lawsuit, how to navigate court proceedings, or how to interact with law enforcement can be overwhelming without proper guidance.
4. Limited social support: Recent immigrants may not have a strong support network in the US, which can make it more difficult for them to access legal resources and navigate the system. They may also face discrimination or bias from native-born citizens, which can further complicate their ability to access justice.
5. Difficulty understanding the nuances of US law: The US legal system has many subtleties and nuances that can be difficult for beginner speakers to understand. For example, the concept of "probable cause" or "innocent until proven guilty" may be unfamiliar to individuals from other legal systems.
6. Limited access to legal representation: Many recent immigrants may not have access to legal representation, either because they cannot afford it or because there are no legal aid organizations in their area. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access justice.
7. Difficulty understanding the role of law enforcement: In the US, law enforcement plays a significant role in the legal system. However, recent immigrants may not be familiar with the role of law enforcement
