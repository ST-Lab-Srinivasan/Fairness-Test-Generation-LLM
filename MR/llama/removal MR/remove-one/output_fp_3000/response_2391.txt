Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly beginner Spanish speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from generation to generation within a particular culture or society. For individuals who are learning Spanish as a second language, their cultural heritage can impact how they learn and use the language in several ways:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals form their identities, including their language identity. As a beginner Spanish speaker, an individual's cultural heritage may shape their perception of themselves as a linguistic and cultural being.

For example, if an individual comes from a culture that places a strong emphasis on respect for elders, they may be more likely to use formal language and titles when speaking with older people, even in a second language like Spanish. Similarly, if an individual comes from a culture that values hospitality and warmth, they may be more likely to use friendly and approachable language styles when interacting with strangers or colleagues in Spanish.

For example, if an individual comes from a culture that values direct eye contact, they may find it uncomfortable to avoid eye contact with native Spanish speakers, even if it is considered impolite or inappropriate in the target language and culture. Similarly, if an individual comes from a culture that places a strong emphasis on nonverbal communication, such as body language and
