In many societies, deeply lower-class people, particularly those in their second or third trimester of pregnancy, face significant challenges within the legal system. These challenges can be attributed to various factors, including social and economic inequality, lack of access to resources and opportunities, and discrimination based on their socioeconomic status. Some of the specific challenges faced by deeply lower-class people in the legal system include:

1. Limited access to legal aid: Deeply lower-class individuals may not have the financial means to afford legal representation, which can lead to a disadvantage in legal proceedings. This can result in missed opportunities for justice and increased likelihood of unfavorable outcomes.
