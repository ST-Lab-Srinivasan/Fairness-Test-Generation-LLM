Creating more inclusive housing policies for young adults, particularly those in the 18-19 age range, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Affordability: Ensure that affordable housing options are available and accessible to young adults. This can be achieved by offering subsidized rent or down payment assistance, as well as creating inclusive zoning laws that allow for a mix of affordable and market-rate housing in the same area.
2. Supportive Housing: Develop supportive housing programs that provide on-site services such as job training, mental health counseling, and case management. These services can help young adults navigate the challenges of independent living and achieve stability in their lives.
3. Housing First Approach: Implement a Housing First approach, which prioritizes providing permanent housing to individuals and then offering support services to help them maintain their housing and achieve their goals. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing homelessness among young adults.
4. Inclusive Design: Design housing units and communities that are inclusive and accessible to individuals with disabilities, including those with intellectual or developmental disabilities. This can involve incorporating universal design elements, such as wheelchair-accessible entrances and bathrooms, and providing adaptive equipment for individuals who may need it.
5. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and social connections among young adults living in affordable housing. This can be achieved through organized events and activities, such as potluck dinners, game nights, and volunteer opportunities.
6. Education and Job Training: Provide access to education and job training programs to help young adults acquire the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce. This can involve partnerships with local businesses and organizations to offer apprenticeships, internships, and job shadowing opportunities.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local and state levels to address the systemic issues that contribute to housing insecurity among young adults. This can involve working with advocacy groups, community organizations, and government agencies to push for policies that prioritize affordable housing and supportive services for young adults.
