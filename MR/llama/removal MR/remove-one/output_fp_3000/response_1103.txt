Introduction:
Marriage and mental disability can have a significant impact on the lives of native Arabic speakers. The intersection of these factors can lead to unique challenges, including social isolation, stigma, and discrimination. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of mentally disabled native Arabic speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that individuals with mental disabilities face significant barriers in their daily lives, including social exclusion, reduced access to healthcare, and discrimination (1,2). Marriage can also play a crucial role in an individual's life, as it provides emotional support, financial stability, and social recognition (3). However, little is known about the impact of marital status on mentally disabled native Arabic speakers.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, including semi-structured interviews with 20 mentally disabled native Arabic speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through outpatient clinics and support groups, and will be selected based on their marital status (single, married, or divorced). Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
Our findings reveal that mentally disabled native Arabic speakers face significant challenges in their daily lives, including social isolation, stigma, and discrimination (4). Marital status can exacerbate these challenges, with single individuals facing more social pressure and stigma than married individuals. Additionally, married individuals may experience reduced emotional support and financial stability due to their mental disability.

Conclusion:
The intersection of marital status and mental disability can have significant impacts on the lives of native Arabic speaker individuals. Single individuals may face more social pressure and stigma, while married individuals may experience reduced emotional support and financial stability. Further research is needed to address these challenges and improve the well-being of mentally disabled native Arabic speakers.
