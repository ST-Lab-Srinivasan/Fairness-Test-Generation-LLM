Native Arabic speakers in Nigeria may face several challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barrier: Many Nigerians who speak Arabic as their first language may struggle to communicate effectively with healthcare providers who do not speak their language fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnoses, which can have serious consequences for their health.
2. Cultural differences: The healthcare system in Nigeria is influenced by Western cultural norms, which may not be aligned with the cultural beliefs and practices of Native Arabic speakers. For example, some Native Arabic speakers may have different attitudes towards medical treatment, such as traditional healing practices, which can lead to delays or non-adherence to medical advice.

5. Lack of health literacy: Many Native Arabic speakers in Nigeria may have limited knowledge about healthcare and medical conditions, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system and make informed decisions about their care.
