The role of cultural heritage in the lives of beginner speaker-independent people can be significant, as it provides a sense of identity and belonging. For individuals who are just starting to learn a new language, cultural heritage can serve as a valuable resource for understanding the language and its nuances. Here are some ways that cultural heritage can play a role in the lives of beginner speaker-independent people:

1. Sense of identity: Cultural heritage can help individuals understand their own identity and how it relates to the language they are learning. For example, someone who identifies as Mexican may be more motivated to learn Spanish than someone who does not identify with that culture.
2. Belonging: Being part of a particular cultural group can provide a sense of belonging and community for beginner speaker-independent people. This can help them feel more confident in their language learning journey.
3. Understanding nuances: Cultural heritage can provide insight into the nuances of a language, such as idioms, colloquialisms, and cultural references that may be unfamiliar to learners. For example, someone who is familiar with Japanese culture may be more likely to understand idiomatic expressions like "karma" or "yin-yang."
4. Language learning motivation: Cultural heritage can be a powerful motivator for language learning, especially when combined with personal interests. For instance, someone who is interested in Korean culture may be more motivated to learn the language.
5. Cultural exchange: Beginner speaker-independent people can use cultural heritage as a way to connect with native speakers and engage in cultural exchange. This can help them improve their language skills and gain a deeper understanding of the culture.
6. Preserving cultural traditions: By learning a new language, beginner speaker-independent people may also be preserving cultural traditions that are important to them. For example, someone who is learning Arabic may be able to connect with their heritage and pass on cultural practices to future generations.
7. Intergenerational connections: Cultural heritage can help bridge intergenerational gaps by providing a common language and cultural understanding between parents and children. For instance, a parent who speaks Spanish at home may encourage their child to learn the language as a way to connect with their cultural heritage.
8. Personal growth: Learning a new language
