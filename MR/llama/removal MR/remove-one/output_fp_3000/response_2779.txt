To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Arabic speakers are met, here are some strategies and recommendations:

1. Assess their level: Conduct a thorough assessment of the learners' prior knowledge and skills to determine their starting point. This will help you tailor your teaching methods and materials to meet their specific needs.
2. Provide interactive learning opportunities: Beginner Arabic speakers may find it challenging to engage with traditional classroom-based learning. To make the learning experience more interactive and engaging, consider incorporating games, role-playing activities, and multimedia resources into your teaching methods.
