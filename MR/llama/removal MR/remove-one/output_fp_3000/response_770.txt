Ensuring the voices of fully asexual nominal individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional effort and a commitment to inclusivity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces: Provide platforms for asexual individuals to share their perspectives without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done through online communities, support groups, or in-person events.
2. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by asexual individuals. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy.
3. Involve asexual individuals in decision-making processes: Actively seek out and include asexual perspectives in decision-making forums, such as community meetings or organizational planning sessions.
4. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or expects them to be interested in sex. Instead, use language that includes and respects the diversity of human experience.
5. Support asexual-friendly policies: Advocate for policies that recognize and support asexual individuals, such as providing options for non-binary gender identification or creating safe spaces for asexual individuals to express themselves without pressure to engage in sexual activities.
6. Engage in intersectional advocacy: Acknowledge the intersections of asexuality with other marginalized identities, such as race, gender, and sexual orientation. Work towards creating inclusive spaces that address the unique challenges faced by each individual.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Recognize that decision-making processes are often shaped by power imbalances. Ensure that asexual individuals have equal opportunities to participate and have their voices heard, particularly in situations where they may be marginalized or excluded.
8. Celebrate asexuality: Organize events and campaigns that celebrate asexual identity and promote understanding and acceptance of asexual individuals. This can help create a more inclusive environment where asexual voices are valued and respected.
9. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support specifically tailored to the needs of asexual individuals, such as counseling or mentorship programs. This can help build confidence and agency within the community.
