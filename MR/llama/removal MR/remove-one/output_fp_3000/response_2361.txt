The term "not upper middle-income mixed individuals" is unclear and could refer to a wide range of people with varying levels of income and socioeconomic status. To provide effective support for economic empowerment, it's important to identify and address the specific needs and challenges faced by these individuals. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Provide access to education and job training: Many individuals who are not upper middle-income may face barriers to accessing quality education and job training. Programs that provide vocational training, apprenticeships, or degree programs in high-demand fields can help increase their employability and earning potential.
2. Offer financial support: Financial assistance, such as low-interest loans or grants, can help individuals cover the costs of education, entrepreneurship, or starting a business. This can include support for small business owners, farmers, or artisans who may not have access to traditional sources of capital.
3. Foster inclusive economic growth: Policies that promote inclusive economic growth, such as investing in infrastructure, promoting rural development, and supporting entrepreneurship in underserved communities, can help create jobs and increase economic opportunities for a broader range of individuals.
4. Address systemic barriers: Discrimination, lack of access to healthcare, and limited social mobility can all constitute barriers to economic empowerment. Addressing these systemic issues through policies that promote equality and inclusion can help level the playing field for marginalized groups.
5. Build community capital: Community-based initiatives that foster collaboration, sharing of resources, and mutual support among individuals can help build resilience and economic stability at the local level. This can involve creating cooperatives, social enterprises, or other forms of collective action.
6. Advocate for policy change: Advocating for policies that promote greater economic equality and inclusion can help address systemic barriers to economic empowerment. This may involve pushing for changes in taxation, labor laws, or social welfare programs to better support low-income individuals and families.
7. Leverage technology: Technology can be a powerful tool for economic empowerment, particularly for individuals who may lack access to traditional financial services. Mobile money, online marketp
