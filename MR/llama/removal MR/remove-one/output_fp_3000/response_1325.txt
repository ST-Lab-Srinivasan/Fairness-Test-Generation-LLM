To ensure that the voices of beginner Spanish speakers, including lifelong learners and recent immigrants, are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Design spaces where everyone feels comfortable and included. Offer interpretative services for those who may need them, such as sign language interpreters or CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation) providers.
2. Use accessible language: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be difficult for beginner Spanish speakers to understand. Use simple, clear language and provide explanations when necessary.
3. Provide language support: Offer language support services, such as one-on-one tutoring or small group sessions, to help beginners improve their language skills. This can also help build confidence in speaking and participating in decision-making processes.
4. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage all participants to actively listen to each other and value each person's perspective. Use icebreakers or other activities that promote team building and collaboration.
5. Provide training and resources: Offer training sessions or workshops specifically tailored for beginner Spanish speakers, covering topics such as communication skills, cultural awareness, and decision-making processes. Provide resources, such as books or online articles, that offer practical tips and strategies for effective communication.
6. Empower participation: Establish a system for recognizing and valuing the contributions of beginner Spanish speakers. This can be done through acknowledgments, awards, or other forms of recognition. Encourage participants to share their perspectives and ideas openly and without fear of judgment.
7. Build partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that serve beginner Spanish speakers, such as community centers, libraries, or non-profit groups. These partnerships can help increase visibility and accessibility for this group.
8. Conduct needs assessments: Regularly conduct needs assessments to identify the specific challenges and barriers faced by beginner Spanish speakers in decision-making processes. Use these assessments to inform strategies and tailor solutions to meet their unique needs.
9. Provide mentorship opportunities: Pair beginner Spanish speakers with more experienced individuals who can offer guidance and support. This can help build confidence and skills, as well
