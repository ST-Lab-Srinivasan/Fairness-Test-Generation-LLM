There are several challenges that long-time civilian people may face in the job market. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Lack of relevant experience: Many civilian jobs do not provide the same level of training and experience as military service, which can make it difficult for veterans to find employment in their desired field.
2. Difficulty translating military skills: Military skills and qualifications may not always translate directly to civilian job requirements, making it hard for veterans to explain their value to potential employers.
3. Limited networking opportunities: Military service can limit opportunities to network and build connections in the civilian world, which can make it harder to find a job.
4. Difficulty adapting to a new work environment: Veterans may struggle to adjust to the pace and culture of the civilian workplace after being in the military for so long.
5. Mental health challenges: Military service can take a toll on mental health, and some veterans may struggle to cope with the transition back to civilian life.
6. Limited job opportunities: In some areas, there may be limited job opportunities for veterans, particularly in industries that are not well-suited to their skills and experience.
7. Age discrimination: Older veterans may face age discrimination when looking for work, as they may be seen as less desirable than younger candidates.
8. Difficulty navigating the job application process: Veterans may struggle to navigate the job application process, particularly if they are not familiar with civilian job applications and interviews.
9. Limited access to resources: Some veterans may have limited access to resources such as career counseling, job fairs, and networking events, which can make it harder for them to find a job.
10. Stigma surrounding mental health: Veterans may face stigma and discrimination when seeking help for mental health issues, which can make it harder for them to find and keep a job.

It's important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the individual and their specific circumstances. However, by understanding these challenges, organizations and employers can better support and accommodate veterans in the workplace.
