As a senior-friendly lawyer, I understand that the legal system can be complex and overwhelming for anyone, let alone those in their 90s. Here are some of the common challenges faced by very old (90s+) beginner people in the legal system:

1. Difficulty understanding legal terminology: Legal language can be confusing and difficult to comprehend, especially for those with cognitive decline or limited education.
2. Limited access to technology: Many older adults may not be familiar with modern technology, such as computers or smartphones, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system online.
3. Limited mobility or transportation options: Older adults may have difficulty traveling to courthouses or law offices due to limited mobility or lack of transportation options.
4. Difficulty communicating with legal professionals: Older adults may struggle to communicate with lawyers or other legal professionals due to hearing or cognitive difficulties.
5. Limited financial resources: Older adults may have limited financial resources, making it difficult to afford legal services or cover the costs of legal proceedings.
6. Lack of support from family or caregivers: Older adults may not have a support system in place to help them navigate the legal system, leaving them feeling isolated and overwhelmed.
7. Difficulty navigating the court system: The court system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Older adults may struggle to understand the different types of courts, the roles of judges and lawyers, and the legal process.
8. Limited access to legal aid services: Legal aid services may not be available or accessible to older adults in some areas, leaving them without adequate support.
9. Difficulty obtaining necessary documents: Older adults may struggle to obtain necessary documents, such as birth certificates or wills, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system.
10. Emotional distress: Legal issues can be emotionally challenging for anyone, but especially so for older adults who may be dealing with declining health or the loss of loved ones.
