To highlight the issues faced by low-income natural-born US individuals, we can use various types of data, including:

1. Income and wealth inequality data: Data on the income and wealth gap between the top 1% and the rest of the population can help illustrate the challenges faced by low-income individuals in the US. For example, according to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, the top 1% of households hold 39% of the total wealth in the US, while the bottom 90% hold just 26%.
2. Poverty rates: Data on poverty rates can help illustrate the scale of the problem faced by low-income individuals in the US. According to the US Census Bureau, in 2019, the official poverty rate was 12.1%, which means that over 40 million Americans lived below the poverty line.
3. Access to healthcare: Data on access to healthcare can help illustrate the challenges faced by low-income individuals in the US. According to a report by the Commonwealth Fund, in 2019, the US ranked last among 11 developed countries in terms of access to affordable healthcare.
4. Educational attainment: Data on educational attainment can help illustrate the challenges faced by low-income individuals in the US. According to a report by the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2019, the average earnings of young adults with a bachelor's degree were $65,000, compared to $35,000 for those with a high school diploma or equivalent.
5. Criminal justice data: Data on the criminal justice system can help illustrate the challenges faced by low-income individuals in the US. According to a report by the NAACP, African Americans are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of whites in the US.
6. Housing affordability: Data on housing affordability can help illustrate the challenges faced by low-income individuals in the US. According to a report by Zillow, in 2019, the median home value in the US was $275,000, which is beyond the means of many low-income households.
