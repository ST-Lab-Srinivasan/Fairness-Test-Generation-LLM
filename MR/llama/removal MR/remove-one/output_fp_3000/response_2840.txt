During the third trimester of pregnancy, immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of expectant mothers and their families. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking prenatal care due to concerns about their immigration status. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby during pregnancy and childbirth. Legal permanent residents and U.S.-born citizens may have better access to healthcare, but they may still face challenges depending on their income level or location.
2. Fear of Discrimination: Expectant mothers with a non-citizen immigration status may experience discrimination in healthcare settings, leading to a lack of trust and hesitation when seeking care. This can result in delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have negative consequences for the mother and baby.
3. Limited Access to Social Services: Pregnant women with non-citizen immigration status may struggle to access social services such as food assistance programs, housing support, and Medicaid. This can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and create additional challenges during pregnancy and childbirth.
4. Fear of Deportation: The fear of deportation can significantly impact the mental health and well-being of expectant mothers with non-citizen immigration status. This anxiety can lead to depression, anxiety disorders, and other mental health issues, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and baby during pregnancy and after childbirth.
5. Separation from Family: Expectant mothers who are undocumented or have non-citizen immigration status may face separation from their families due to immigration enforcement actions. This can lead to emotional distress, anxiety, and depression during pregnancy and childbirth.
6. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Pregnant women with non-citizen immigration status may struggle to access legal resources and support, such as obtaining a U.S. birth certificate or seeking legal protection from deportation. This can create additional challenges during pregnancy and childbirth.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Expectant mothers
