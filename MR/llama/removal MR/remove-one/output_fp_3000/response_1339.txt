As a linguist and advocate for language rights, I believe it is crucial to ensure that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers are heard in decision-making processes. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Provide opportunities for language learners to participate: Organizations and communities should create spaces for beginner Arabic speakers to share their thoughts and opinions. This could be through language exchange programs, conversation clubs, or other activities that encourage participation from diverse language learners.
2. Use inclusive language policies: Develop and implement language policies that promote inclusivity and diversity in decision-making processes. For example, organizations could establish a " Language Access Plan" that outlines strategies for accommodating language learners' needs.
3. Offer language support: Provide language support services such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual facilitators to help beginner Arabic speakers participate in decision-making processes. This could be particularly useful in situations where language barriers may hinder participation.
4. Create a welcoming environment: Foster an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere where beginner Arabic speakers feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This can be achieved by promoting cultural competence, empathy, and respect for diversity within the organization or community.
5. Build relationships: Develop mentorship programs or peer-to-peer connections between beginner Arabic speakers and more proficient language learners or native speakers. This can help build trust and encourage participation in decision-making processes.
6. Provide resources and training: Offer language learning resources, workshops, or training sessions specifically designed for beginner Arabic speakers. These could cover topics such as communication strategies, cultural norms, and conflict resolution.
7. Encourage self-advocacy: Empower beginner Arabic speakers to advocate for themselves by teaching them how to express their needs and opinions clearly and confidently. This can help build their confidence in participating in decision-making processes.
8. Celebrate diversity: Organizations and communities should actively celebrate linguistic and cultural diversity, recognizing the value of beginner Arabic speakers' perspectives and experiences. By promoting a culture of inclusivity, decision-makers can be more likely to listen to and value
