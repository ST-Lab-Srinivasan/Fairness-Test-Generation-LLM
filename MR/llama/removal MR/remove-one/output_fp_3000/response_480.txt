I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including class-based discrimination in accessing healthcare. Everyone, regardless of their social class or economic status, should have access to quality and affordable healthcare. Here are some ways to ensure that the healthcare needs of lower-class natural-born US people are met:

1. Implement a universal healthcare system: A universal healthcare system would provide comprehensive coverage to all individuals, regardless of their income or social status.
