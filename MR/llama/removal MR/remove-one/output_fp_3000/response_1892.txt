Creating more inclusive community events for people who are carriers of genetic conditions, such as lost spouses, can be a challenging but rewarding endeavor. Here are some suggestions on how to create a more inclusive environment:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the specific genetic condition that your community is affected by, including its causes, symptoms, and impact on individuals and families. Share this knowledge with others to raise awareness and promote understanding.
2. Create a safe space: Make sure that your event provides a safe and comfortable environment for all participants. This can be achieved by providing a quiet room or area for those who need it, offering sensory-friendly activities, and being mindful of any potential triggers.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage attendees to connect with each other through shared experiences and common goals. Provide opportunities for people to share their stories and feelings in a supportive environment.
4. Offer practical support: Provide information and resources on how to navigate the healthcare system, access support services, and manage the emotional challenges of being a carrier or having a loved one with a genetic condition.
5. Involve the community: Engage with local organizations and groups that can provide additional support and resources to attendees. This could include hospitals, clinics, support groups, and advocacy organizations.
6. Provide sensory-friendly activities: Offer activities that are tailored to the needs of individuals with genetic conditions, such as visual or auditory-based games, or activities that can be adapted for different abilities.
7. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that could be offensive or alienating to attendees. Use person-first language (e.g., "person with a genetic condition" rather than "genetic condition patient").
8. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for attendees who may need them, such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or closed captioning.
9. Build a diverse team: Ensure that your event planning team is diverse and includes individuals with genetic conditions, caregivers, and professionals from various backgrounds. This can help ensure that the needs of all attendees are considered and
