Documented non-lifelong residents, also known as "temporary migrants," face significant challenges in the healthcare system. These individuals are often undocumented or have temporary status, which can lead to barriers in accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the challenges faced by documented non-lifelong people in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Documented non-lifelong residents may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be denied medical care or face discrimination from healthcare providers, leading to delayed or inadequate treatment.
2. Language and cultural barriers: Non-lifelong residents may face language and cultural barriers when interacting with healthcare providers. This can result in misunderstandings or miscommunications that can lead to adverse health outcomes.
3. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Documented non-lifelong residents may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system, particularly if they are not familiar with local healthcare policies and practices. This can lead to difficulties in accessing necessary care or services.
4. Cost barriers: Non-lifelong residents may face financial barriers due to their immigration status. They may be unable to afford healthcare services or prescription medications, leading to delayed or foregone care.
5. Lack of continuity of care: Documented non-lifelong residents may experience disruptions in their healthcare due to changes in their immigration status or residency. This can result in gaps in care and inconsistent treatment.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Non-lifelong residents may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization. This can negatively impact their mental and physical health.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Documented non-lifelong residents may have limited access to specialized care due to their immigration status. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment for chronic conditions or complex medical needs.
8. Difficulty accessing emergency services: Non-lifelong residents may face barriers in accessing emergency healthcare services
