Native Arabic speakers may face various challenges in the legal system, particularly when communicating with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who are not fluent in their language. Here are some of the common challenges faced by native Arabic speaker casual people in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge faced by native Arabic speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be difficult to understand for non-native speakers, and the lack of proficiency in English or other languages used in the legal system can hinder communication and understanding.
2. Cultural Differences: Arab culture has unique customs, values, and beliefs that may differ from those of lawyers and judges who are not familiar with these cultural nuances. This lack of understanding can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications, which can affect the outcome of legal proceedings.
3. Lack of Trust: Native Arabic speakers may feel uncomfortable interacting with legal professionals who are not fluent in their language or culturally aware. This lack of trust can make them hesitant to communicate effectively and seek legal advice when needed.
4.
