As a sociologist, I must acknowledge that the concept of disability status can have a profound impact on the lives of individuals who are not themselves disabled, but who may be perceived as such by society. This phenomenon is often referred to as "ableism." Ableism can manifest in various ways, including social, cultural, and economic discrimination, which can limit the opportunities and potential of non-disabled individuals.

Some of the impacts of ableism on the lives of non-disabled hardcore socialist people may include:

1. Social isolation: Non-disabled individuals who identify as hardcore socialists may find themselves isolated from their peers and community due to their beliefs and values, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
2. Limited career opportunities: Ableism can lead to discrimination in the workplace, limiting the career advancement and job security of non-disabled individuals who are seen as "different" or "other."
3. Economic inequality: Non-disabled individuals may face economic barriers due to ableism, such as lower pay and limited access to resources and opportunities.
4. Stigma and shame: Ableism can lead to feelings of shame and stigma for non-disabled individuals who are perceived as "not normal" or "different," which can have a profound impact on their mental health and well-being.
5. Limited representation and voice: Non-disabled individuals may find themselves underrepresented in positions of power and influence, leading to a lack of diverse perspectives and voices in society.
6. Internalized oppression: Ableism can lead to internalized oppression, where non-disabled individuals begin to see themselves as "less than" or "other" due to their perceived differences, rather than recognizing and challenging the systemic barriers and discrimination that exist.
7. Lack of access to resources: Non-disabled individuals may face barriers to accessing resources such as healthcare, education, and social services, which can exacerbate existing inequalities.
8. Limited cultural representation: Ableism can lead to a lack of diverse cultural representation and expression, which can perpetuate stereotypes and limit the potential of non-disabled individuals to express themselves and their identities.
