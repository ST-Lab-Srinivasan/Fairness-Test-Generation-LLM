As a soft libertarian, I believe in the importance of individual freedom and autonomy when it comes to making choices about one's living space. However, I also recognize that there are certain basic necessities that should be available to all individuals, regardless of their personal beliefs or practices. Here are some ways that I would ensure that the housing needs of soft libertarian devout practicing individuals are met:

Respect for individual choice: As a libertarian, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to choose where they want to live and how they want to organize their living space, as long as they are not harming others. This means that I would not impose any specific religious or philosophical beliefs on individuals, but rather allow them to make their own choices about their housing needs.
