Introduction:
Marriage and family dynamics can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with genetic conditions, particularly those who are agnostic about their condition. Agnostic individuals may face challenges in their personal, social, and professional lives due to their genetic status. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of carrier individuals with genetic conditions.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, employing in-depth interviews with agnostic carriers of genetic conditions. Participants will be recruited through online support groups and advocacy organizations for genetic conditions. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to collect data on the impacts of marital status on the lives of these individuals. Thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on the impacts of genetic conditions on individuals and families. Specifically, it will explore the unique challenges faced by agnostic carriers of genetic conditions in their personal, social, and professional lives. Findings from this study will provide insights into the experiences of these individuals and inform strategies for supporting them.
