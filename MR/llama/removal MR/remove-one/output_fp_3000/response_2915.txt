As a combat-retired Native American natural-born US citizen, there are several support systems that can be crucial to your well-being and success. Here are some of the most important ones:

1. Veterans' Organizations: As a veteran, you may want to connect with other veterans who share similar experiences and struggles. Organizations such as the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, or Disabled American Veterans can provide a sense of community and camaraderie.
2. Mental Health Services: Combat can have a profound impact on mental health, and it's essential to seek professional help if you're struggling with PTSD, depression, or anxiety. Many VA hospitals and clinics offer mental health services specifically designed for combat veterans.
3. Peer Support: Connecting with other veterans who have experienced similar challenges can be incredibly helpful in your transition back to civilian life. Programs such as the Warrior Transition Unit (WTU) or the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) peer support program can provide this type of support.
4. Family Support: As a combat retiree, you may face unique challenges in your family dynamics. Consider reaching out to organizations like the US Army Wounded Warrior Program or the Military OneSource Family Readiness Program for additional support and resources.
5. Career Counseling: Transitioning from military to civilian life can be daunting, especially when it comes to finding a new career path. Utilize services like the VA's Career Development and Occupational Transition Services (CDOTS) or the US Department of Labor's Job Centers for assistance in exploring career options and developing job search strategies.
6. Education and Training: Many combat retirees may find it beneficial to pursue further education or training to enhance their employability. The GI Bill and other educational benefits can help cover the costs of tuition, books, and fees for courses related to your career goals.
7. Social Support Networks: Building a network of friends, family, and other supportive individuals can help you navigate the challenges of civilian life. Consider joining veteran-focused organizations or participating in community events to expand your social circle.
