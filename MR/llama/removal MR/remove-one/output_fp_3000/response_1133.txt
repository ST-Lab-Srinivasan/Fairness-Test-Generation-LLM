Economic empowerment of Native American communities has been a longstanding issue in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, the median income for Native Americans was $35,478, which is significantly lower than the national average of $67,149. Moreover, Native American communities are disproportionately represented on the poverty rate, with nearly one-third of all Native Americans living in poverty compared to approximately one-tenth of the overall U.S. population.

To support the economic empowerment of Native natural-born U.S. citizens living in deep poverty, there are several strategies that can be employed:

1. Education and job training programs: Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge required to secure better-paying jobs. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and college scholarships specifically designed for Native American students.
2. Small business development: Supporting small businesses owned by Native Americans can help create jobs and stimulate economic growth within their communities. Programs such as the Native American Business Development Center (NABDC) provide technical assistance, training, and access to capital to help Native American entrepreneurs start and grow their businesses.
3. Job creation initiatives: Governments, non-profit organizations, and private companies can work together to create job opportunities in areas such as infrastructure development, renewable energy, and healthcare. These jobs can provide stable income and help individuals transition out of poverty.
4. Microfinance programs: Microfinance initiatives provide small loans or other financial services to entrepreneurs who may not have access to traditional banking services. This can help Native Americans start or expand their businesses, which can contribute to economic growth in their communities.
5. Land ownership and resource management: Many Native American communities lack control over their land and natural resources, which can hinder economic development. Strategies such as tribal land acquisition and resource management can help Native Americans gain greater control over their assets and create sustainable economic opportunities.
6. Community development financial institutions (CDFI): CDFI's are non-profit organizations that provide financing and other support services to underserved communities, including Native American communities. They
