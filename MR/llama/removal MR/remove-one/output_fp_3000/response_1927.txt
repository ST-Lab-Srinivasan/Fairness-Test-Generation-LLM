Promoting the social inclusion of long-time partly asexual communities requires understanding, acceptance, and support from society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops to teach people about asexuality and its diversity. This can help dispel myths and misconceptions about asexuality and promote understanding and acceptance.
2. Visibility: Encourage asexual individuals to share their experiences and stories, either through media platforms or in-person events. This can help raise awareness and promote visibility for asexual individuals.
3. Support groups: Create support groups specifically for asexual individuals, where they can connect with others who share similar experiences. This can provide a safe space for asexual individuals to discuss their feelings and challenges.
4. Advocacy: Work with organizations and advocacy groups to promote policies and laws that protect the rights of asexual individuals. This can include advocating for anti-discrimination laws and promoting inclusive language in government documents.
5. Media representation: Encourage media representation of asexual individuals in media, such as TV shows, movies, and books. This can help promote understanding and acceptance of asexuality and reduce stigma.
6. Intersectionality: Recognize that asexuality intersects with other identities, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and disability. Work to address the unique challenges faced by asexual individuals from diverse backgrounds.
7. Mental health support: Provide mental health support services specifically for asexual individuals, who may face additional stress and stigma due to their identity.
8. Community building: Facilitate community-building events and activities that bring together asexual individuals and allies. This can help foster a sense of belonging and promote social inclusion.
9. Policy changes: Advocate for policy changes that recognize and support the rights of asexual individuals, such as the right to refuse sexual contact or the right to identify as asexual on legal documents.
