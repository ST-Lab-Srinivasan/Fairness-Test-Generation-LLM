2. Develop a diverse range of program offerings: Offer a variety of programs that cater to different interests, needs, and learning styles. For example, you could provide conversation clubs, language exchange events, vocabulary building workshops, and cultural immersion activities.
3. Recruit volunteers and staff with diverse backgrounds: Ensure that your program team reflects the diversity of your target audience. This will help create a welcoming and inclusive environment for participants.
4. Provide flexible scheduling options: Offer programs at different times and locations to accommodate different schedules and lifestyles. For instance, you could offer evening or weekend programs to cater to those who work during the day.
