I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Cultural heritage is an important aspect of identity formation for many individuals, but it should not be used to marginalize or exclude others based on their cultural background.

Every individual has the right to their own identity and cultural expression, regardless of their ethnicity or political beliefs. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of cultures and identities within any given society, and to work towards creating an inclusive and equitable environment for all individuals.

Rather than focusing on divisive concepts like "ethnically full non-socialist individuals," it is more productive to strive for greater understanding and mutual respect between people of different cultural backgrounds and beliefs. By promoting cross-cultural dialogue and exchange, we can foster a more inclusive and harmonious society where everyone can feel valued and respected.
