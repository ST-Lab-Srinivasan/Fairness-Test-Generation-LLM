Mexican casual workers, also known as "informal economy" workers, face a range of challenges when it comes to navigating the legal system. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Many Mexican casual workers do not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
2. Limited knowledge of the legal system: Many casual workers may not have a good understanding of how the legal system works, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the system and advocate for themselves.
