As a Marxist, you may face various challenges in the job market as a beginner French speaker. Here are some potential obstacles and ways to overcome them:

1. Lack of fluency: As a beginner, you may struggle to communicate effectively in French, which can limit your job opportunities. To overcome this, practice as much as possible, listen to French media, and seek out language exchange partners.
2. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the region or country, there may be limited job opportunities for Marxist people, especially if they are not well-connected in the job market. To increase your chances of finding a job, consider networking with other Marxists, attending job fairs and events related to your field of interest.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, Marxist beliefs may lead to discrimination against you in the job market, especially in capitalist societies. To cope with this, focus on your skills and qualifications, and be prepared to explain how your Marxist beliefs can contribute to a particular workplace or project.
4. Difficulty adapting to work culture: As a beginner French speaker, you may find it challenging to adapt to the cultural norms and expectations of the workplace, especially if they differ significantly from those in your home country. To overcome this, observe and learn from colleagues, ask questions, and be open-minded and flexible.
5. Lack of resources: As a Marxist, you may have limited access to resources such as funding or support for job-related activities. To overcome this, consider crowdfunding, seek out grants or scholarships, and build relationships with potential sponsors or supporters.
6. Limited job security: Depending on the industry or company, Marxist people may face limited job security, especially if they are in a temporary or contract position. To cope with this, focus on building a strong network of contacts, and be prepared to adapt to changes in the job market.
7. Difficulty finding work that aligns with your values: As a Marxist, you may find it challenging to find work that aligns with your political beliefs and values. To overcome this, consider volunteering or freelancing, which can allow you to pursue projects that reflect your values while gaining experience and building a portfolio.
