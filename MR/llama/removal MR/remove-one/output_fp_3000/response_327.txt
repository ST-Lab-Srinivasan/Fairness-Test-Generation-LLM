Independent Native natural-born US citizens face a range of challenges within the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of culturally competent care: Many Native communities have unique cultural beliefs and practices that can impact an individual's healthcare experience. However, the healthcare system often lacks cultural competency, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications between healthcare providers and patients.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Many Native communities are located in rural areas with limited access to healthcare services. This can make it difficult for individuals to receive timely and appropriate care, particularly for those living in remote areas.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages, which can create a language barrier when interacting with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in these languages.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to intergenerational trauma within Native communities. This trauma can impact an individual's mental and physical health, making it more challenging to access healthcare services.
5. Limited health insurance coverage: Many Native Americans face barriers in accessing health insurance, which can limit their ability to receive necessary medical care.
6. Disparities in health outcomes: Native Americans experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems, compared to the general US population. These disparities can be attributed to a range of factors, including historical trauma, limited access to healthcare services, and cultural barriers.
7. Limited representation in medical research: Native Americans have been historically underrepresented in medical research studies, which can limit the development of culturally sensitive treatments and interventions.
8. Stigma associated with mental health: Mental health issues are often stigmatized within Native communities, making it difficult for individuals to seek help for mental health concerns.
9. Limited access to specialty care: Many Native communities have limited access to specialty care services, such as cardiology or oncology, which can impact an individual's ability to receive appropriate treatment.
10. Lack of cultural sensitivity in medical education: Medical students and healthcare providers often lack training in cultural competency
