Non-middle-class mixed heritage people in the healthcare system face a range of challenges that can affect their access to quality care. Here are some of the common challenges faced by this community:

1. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained or culturally sensitive to the needs of mixed heritage patients, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Language barriers: Mixed heritage individuals may face language barriers due to their parents or grandparents speaking different languages, making it difficult for them to communicate with healthcare providers.
3. Discrimination and bias: Mixed heritage individuals may experience discrimination and bias from healthcare providers, leading to a lack of trust and confidence in the healthcare system.
4. Inadequate understanding of cultural practices: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of mixed heritage patients, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of their health needs.
5. Difficulty accessing care: Mixed heritage individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to systemic issues such as lack of transportation, childcare, or cultural competence in their area.
6. Stigma and shame: Mixed heritage individuals may experience stigma and shame related to their cultural identity, which can affect their ability to access care or disclose personal information to healthcare providers.
7. Lack of representation: Mixed heritage individuals may feel underrepresented in the healthcare system, leading to a lack of visibility and voice in shaping healthcare policies and practices.
8. Limited understanding of genetic diversity: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the genetic diversity within mixed heritage populations, which can lead to inadequate testing or misinterpretation of test results.
9. Inadequate pain management: Mixed heritage individuals may experience barriers in accessing adequate pain management due to cultural beliefs and practices related to pain and suffering.
10. Lack of culturally sensitive mental health services: Mixed heritage individuals may face barriers in accessing mental health services that are culturally sensitive and tailored to their specific needs.
