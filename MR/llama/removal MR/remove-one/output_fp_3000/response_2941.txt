Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Immigrant Identities in the US

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US individuals. As they navigate their new lives in America, they must reconcile their cultural backgrounds with their new surroundings and social norms. This paper aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of immigrant non-libertarian individuals in the US.

Theory:
Cultural heritage encompasses a wide range of elements, including language, religion, customs, traditions, and history. These cultural artifacts shape an individual's identity by providing a sense of belonging and purpose. Immigrants bring their cultural heritage with them when they move to the US, which can impact their identities in various ways.

3. Identity Formation: Cultural heritage can influence how immigrants form their identities in the US. For example, immigrants may adopt aspects of American culture while still maintaining their cultural heritage, creating a unique identity that is both American and non-American.

For instance, an immigrant may experience discrimination based on their cultural heritage, which can impact their sense of self and belonging in the US.
