Creating more inclusive community programs for recent immigrants to Canada requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach. Here are some strategies that organizations and communities can use to support this goal:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of recent immigrants. This can include learning about different cultures, customs, and practices.
2. Language support: Offer language support services, such as language classes or interpreters, to ensure that program materials and communications are accessible to a wide range of participants.
3. Accessibility accommodations: Make sure that program locations and activities are accessible to people with disabilities. This can include providing wheelchair accessibility, audio descriptions, or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation.
4. Inclusive marketing: Develop marketing materials and outreach strategies that are inclusive of diverse communities. Use language and images that reflect the diversity of recent immigrants to Canada.
5. Community engagement: Engage with local communities and organizations to build partnerships and collaborations. This can help to increase awareness and support for programs among diverse audiences.
6. Participatory programming: Involve recent immigrants in the design and delivery of community programs. This can help ensure that programs are relevant and meaningful to their needs and interests.
7. Flexibility and adaptability: Be flexible and adaptable in response to changing community needs and circumstances. This can involve regularly assessing program impact and making adjustments as needed.
8. Intersectional approach: Consider the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class, and other factors that may affect recent immigrants' experiences. This can help ensure that programs are inclusive and address a range of needs and concerns.
9. Community mentorship: Pair recent immigrants with experienced community members who can provide guidance and support. This can help build connections and networks within the community.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate program impact and gather feedback from participants. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that programs are meeting the needs of diverse communities.

By implementing these strategies, organizations and communities can create more inclusive community programs for recent immigrants to Canada.
