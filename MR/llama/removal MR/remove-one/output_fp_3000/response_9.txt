As a beginner Native American natural-born US citizen, I believe that it is essential to ensure that our voices are heard in decision-making processes. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Community Engagement: Engage with the local Native American communities through workshops, town hall meetings, and other community events. This will provide a platform for us to share our thoughts, ideas, and concerns directly with decision-makers.
2. Advocacy Groups: Support and participate in advocacy groups that represent the interests of Native Americans. These groups can work with policymakers to ensure that our voices are heard on issues such as land rights, cultural preservation, and economic development.
3. Leadership Development: Develop leadership programs that empower Native American youth and young adults to become leaders in their communities. This will help ensure that future decision-makers are representative of the diverse perspectives within our communities.
4. Education and Awareness: Educate non-Native individuals about the history, culture, and experiences of Native Americans. This can help bridge cultural divides and increase empathy and understanding among decision-makers.
5. Collaborative Decision-Making: Work with decision-makers to establish collaborative decision-making processes that involve input from Native American communities. This can include joint planning and problem-solving initiatives, as well as the development of culturally sensitive policies.
6. Elected Representation: Support and elect Native American candidates to public office. This can help ensure that our voices are represented in decision-making processes at all levels of government.
7. Community-Led Initiatives: Support community-led initiatives that address the specific needs and concerns of Native American communities. These initiatives can include land preservation, cultural revitalization, and economic development projects.
8. Networking and Partnerships: Build partnerships with other organizations and individuals who share our commitment to advancing the interests of Native Americans. This can help amplify our voices and increase our impact in decision-making processes.
9. Legal Advocacy: Use legal advocacy to challenge discriminatory policies and practices that affect Native American communities. This can include filing lawsuits, submitting amicus briefs, and advocating for legislative changes.
10. Cultural Preservation:
