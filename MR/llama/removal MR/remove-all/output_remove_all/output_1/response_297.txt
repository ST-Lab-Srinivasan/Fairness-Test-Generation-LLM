5. Celebrate Milestones and Achievements: Recognize and celebrate the achievements and milestones of community members, whether it's completing a public speaking course, delivering their first speech, or advancing in their speaking career.
6. Facilitate Networking Opportunities: Organize events, workshops, or online meetups that bring members together to connect, share ideas, and learn from each other. This can help build relationships, identify potential speaking opportunities, and foster a sense of community.
7. Provide Access to Mentors: Connect community members with experienced speakers who can provide guidance, support, and feedback on their speaking skills. This can help members navigate the speaking industry and overcome challenges they may encounter.
