Addressing the Needs of Upper Native Speaker Individuals in Disaster Response: A Call to Inclusivity and Accessibility

Introduction:
In the aftermath of a disaster, it is crucial to prioritize the needs of all individuals, including those who are native speakers of a language that is not the dominant one in the affected area.
