Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Recently Devout Practicing Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those who have recently embraced devout practices. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of recently devout practicing individuals and how these individuals navigate their religious beliefs within their cultural background.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity by providing a sense of belonging, continuity, and tradition (Hood, 2013). For recently devout practicing individuals, cultural heritage can play a crucial role in shaping their religious beliefs and practices.

For example, a child may be raised in a community with strong religious traditions, leading them to feel pressure to conform to these norms (Hood, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, collecting data through interviews and observations of recently devout practicing individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, selecting individuals who have recently embraced devout practices and are actively engaged in their religious communities.

Data Analysis:
The data collected through interviews and observations will be analyzed using thematic analysis, identifying patterns and themes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently devout practicing individuals.

Significance:
This study contributes to our understanding of how cultural heritage influences the identities of recently devout practicing individuals. Findings will provide insights into the ways that cultural heritage shapes religious beliefs and practices, highlighting the complex inter
