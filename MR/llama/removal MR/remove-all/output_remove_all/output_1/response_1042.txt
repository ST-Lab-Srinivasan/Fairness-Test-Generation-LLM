Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to Native American populations who have recently migrated to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved trust and rapport: When healthcare providers demonstrate an understanding of the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of Native American patients, it can help build trust and rapport. This is critical in a population that has experienced historical trauma and ongoing discrimination in the healthcare system.
