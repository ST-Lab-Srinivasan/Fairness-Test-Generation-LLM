Non-ethnically full individuals, also known as mixed-race or biracial individuals, face unique challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges can arise from a variety of factors, including discrimination, misunderstandings, and a lack of cultural competency among healthcare providers. Some of the specific challenges faced by non-ethnically full people in the healthcare system include:

1. Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis: Non-ethnically full individuals may face barriers in communicating their symptoms and medical history to healthcare providers due to language or cultural differences. This can result in delays or misdiagnoses, which can have serious consequences for their health.
2. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the unique cultural beliefs and practices of non-ethnically full individuals, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of their medical needs.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race or ethnicity still exists in many healthcare settings. Non-ethnically full individuals may experience discrimination from healthcare providers, which can affect the quality of care they receive.
4. Distrust: Historical and systemic racism has led to a lack of trust in the healthcare system among non-ethnically full communities. This distrust can make it difficult for these individuals to seek medical care or follow treatment recommendations.
5. Limited access to culturally competent care: Depending on their location, non-ethnically full individuals may have limited access to healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to their cultural background.
6. Inadequate representation: Non-ethnically full individuals may feel underrepresented or misrepresented in the healthcare system, leading to a lack of understanding of their unique needs and experiences.
7. Stigma associated with mixed-race identity: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being mixed-race or biracial in many societies. Non-ethnically full individuals may face discrimination or prejudice based on their identity, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
8. Lack of representation in medical research: Non-ethnically full individuals may be underrepresented in medical research studies,
