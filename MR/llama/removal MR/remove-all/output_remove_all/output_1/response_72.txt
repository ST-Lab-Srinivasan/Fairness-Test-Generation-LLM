Creating more inclusive social policies for working professional separated individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the changing landscape of work and family: The traditional breadwinner model is no longer relevant in today's society. With the rise of the gig economy, remote work, and the increasing number of women in the workforce, policies must adapt to these changes. Policies should recognize that both parents are now often working outside the home and provide support for their careers.
2. Provide flexible work arrangements: Offering flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, compressed workweeks, or job-sharing can help working professional separated individuals balance their work and family responsibilities. This can also help reduce childcare costs and increase productivity.
3. Enhance parental leave policies: Parental leave policies should be more inclusive and provide adequate time off for both mothers and fathers. Policies should also address the needs of same-sex parents, single parents, and adoptive parents.
4. Improve access to affordable childcare: Ensure that there are affordable and high-quality childcare options available to working professional separated individuals. This can include government-subsidized childcare centers, as well as tax credits or deductions for family caregivers.
5. Offer financial support: Policies should provide financial support for working professional separated individuals, such as subsidies for childcare costs, education expenses, and health insurance premiums. This can help reduce the economic strain on families and promote gender equality in the workplace.
6. Promote workplace diversity and inclusion: Encourage employers to implement policies that promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace. This can include flexible work arrangements, mentorship programs, and unconscious bias training for managers.
7. Address discrimination and stigma: Policies should address discrimination and stigma faced by working professional separated individuals. This can include anti-discrimination laws that protect parents from workplace discrimination and provide support for family caregivers.
8. Provide education and training: Offer education and training programs to help working professional separated individuals develop new skills and advance in their careers.
