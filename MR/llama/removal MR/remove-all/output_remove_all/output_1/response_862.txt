Supporting communities just above the poverty line can be a challenging task, as these communities often face similar challenges as those living in extreme poverty, but with fewer resources. Here are some effective strategies for supporting these communities:

1. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building programs to enhance the skills and knowledge of community members, particularly in areas such as entrepreneurship, financial management, and project management. This can help them develop the necessary tools to improve their economic situation.
2. Access to Financial Services: Establish or partner with microfinance institutions that provide affordable loans and savings accounts to community members. This can help them access capital for small businesses or entrepreneurial ventures, as well as save money for the future.
3. Entrepreneurship and Job Creation: Support community-based enterprises and job creation initiatives that provide employment opportunities for community members. This can include training and support for starting a business, as well as access to capital for expansion or start-up costs.
4. Agricultural Development: Implement agricultural development programs that focus on sustainable farming practices, value chain development, and market access. This can help improve food security and increase income streams for community members.
5. Access to Healthcare: Establish health clinics or partnerships with local healthcare providers to improve access to quality healthcare services for community members. This can include preventative care, maternal and child health, and disease management programs.
6. Education and Literacy: Invest in educational programs that provide adult literacy training, vocational skills training, and primary education for children. This can help reduce poverty by increasing the community's capacity to earn a living wage and improve their quality of life.
7. Community Mapping and Planning: Conduct participatory community mapping and planning exercises to identify local strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis). This can help community members identify potential solutions to their challenges and prioritize their efforts for maximum impact.
8. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, national, or international level that address the root causes of poverty in these communities. This can include advocating for policies that promote economic growth, social equity,
