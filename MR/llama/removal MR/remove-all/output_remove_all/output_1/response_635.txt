Addressing the Needs of Non-Professional Mandarin Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disasters have no respect for language barriers, and non-professional Mandarin speakers often face significant challenges during disaster response due to communication gaps. To address this issue, it is crucial to develop effective strategies to communicate with these individuals and ensure their needs are met during disaster response operations.
