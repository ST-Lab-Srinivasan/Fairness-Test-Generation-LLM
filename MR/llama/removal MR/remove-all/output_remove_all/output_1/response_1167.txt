Temporary individuals, also known as "nomadic workers" or "location-independent workers," are individuals who do not have a fixed workplace and instead work remotely or on a freelance basis. Recently, there has been an increasing trend towards temporary work arrangements due to the rise of the gig economy and the growing demand for flexible work options. However, this shift has also created challenges for these individuals in terms of social inclusion and access to benefits.

To create more inclusive social policies for temporary individuals, we need to address the following key issues:

1. Social Security and Benefits: Temporary workers often face difficulties in accessing social security benefits such as unemployment insurance, health insurance, and retirement plans. Policymakers can explore options to extend these benefits to temporary workers or provide alternative forms of support.
2. Employment Protection: Temporary workers often lack job security and may face discrimination in the workplace. Strengthening employment protection laws and regulations can help ensure that temporary workers are treated fairly and have access to the same rights as permanent employees.
3. Access to Education and Training: Temporary workers may face barriers in accessing education and training opportunities due to their non-traditional work arrangements. Policymakers can provide support for upskilling and reskilling programs that cater to the needs of temporary workers.
4. Housing and Urban Planning: Many temporary workers struggle to find affordable and secure housing, which can impact their overall well-being and quality of life. Policymakers can explore options to provide more affordable housing options and improve urban planning to better accommodate the needs of temporary workers.
5. Social Isolation: Temporary workers may experience social isolation due to their lack of a fixed workplace and social connections. Policymakers can provide support for building community networks and connecting temporary workers with local organizations and initiatives that promote social inclusion.
6. Data Privacy and Security: With the increasing use of digital technologies, temporary workers may face challenges in protecting their personal data and privacy. Policymakers can establish stronger data protection laws to ensure that temporary workers' rights are protected.
7. Access to Financial Services: Temporary workers may face difficulties in accessing financial services such as bank accounts
