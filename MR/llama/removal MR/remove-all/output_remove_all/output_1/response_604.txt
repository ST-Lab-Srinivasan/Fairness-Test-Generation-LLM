Creating more inclusive community programs for native speakers of a language for a long time can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to the needs and concerns of the community: It is essential to listen to the needs and concerns of the community when designing inclusive programs. Hold focus groups or surveys to gather feedback from community members, and use this information to tailor your programs to their specific needs.
2. Provide language classes tailored to the needs of native speakers: Offer language classes that cater specifically to the needs of native speakers. This can include classes that focus on the nuances of the language, as well as cultural and historical contexts.
3. Offer a variety of program formats: Offer a range of program formats to accommodate different learning styles and preferences. For example, you could offer in-person classes, online courses, or even hybrid models that combine both.
4. Involve the community in program development: Encourage community members to participate in the development and implementation of programs. This can help ensure that the programs are tailored to the needs and preferences of the community.
5. Provide opportunities for socialization and connection: Offer opportunities for native speakers to connect with one another and build relationships. This can help create a sense of community and belonging, which is essential for language learning and cultural exchange.
6. Celebrate and promote cultural events: Host cultural events that celebrate the language and culture of the community. This can help create a sense of pride and identity among native speakers, and provide opportunities for language practice and cultural exchange.
7. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help native speakers improve their language skills. This can include access to language learning materials, as well as opportunities for language practice with native speakers.
8. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Ensure that the programs are safe and inclusive for all participants. This can involve providing a welcoming atmosphere, as well as addressing any issues or concerns that may arise during the program.
9. Encourage intergenerational exchange: Encourage native speakers of different ages to participate in language learning programs together. This can help foster intergenerational connections and provide opportunities for cultural exchange
