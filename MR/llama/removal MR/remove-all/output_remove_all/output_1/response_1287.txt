Highlighting the issues faced by "strongly not for a long time" individuals, also known as chronically homeless, can be challenging as they often lack access to basic necessities like shelter and healthcare. However, here are some ways data can be used to raise awareness and advocate for their cause:

1. Mapping and visualization: Create interactive maps and visualizations to display the locations where chronically homeless individuals are concentrated. This can help identify areas of high need and inform decision-makers about the magnitude of the problem. For example, the City of Los Angeles's Homelessness Count 2019 Report provides a detailed map of homelessness across the city, highlighting hotspots and trends.
2. Quantifying the extent of the problem: Use data to quantify the number of chronically homeless individuals in a given area over time. This can help measure progress (or lack thereof) in addressing the issue. For example, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Point-in-Time Counts provide an annual estimate of the number of homeless individuals across the United States.
3. Examining demographic trends: Analyze data on the demographics of chronically homeless individuals, such as age, gender, and ethnicity. This can help identify subpopulations that are disproportionately affected by homelessness and inform targeted interventions. For instance, the National Alliance to End Homelessness's (NAEH) report "The State of Homelessness in America" provides demographic data on homeless individuals across the US.
4. Monitoring health outcomes: Use data to track the health outcomes of chronically homeless individuals, such as rates of mental illness, substance abuse, and infectious diseases. This can help demonstrate the impact of homelessness on individual well-being and inform public health interventions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) "Homelessness and Public Health" webpage provides resources on the health consequences of homelessness.
5. Analyzing economic data: Examine economic data related to homelessness, such as poverty rates, unemployment rates, and income inequality. This can help
