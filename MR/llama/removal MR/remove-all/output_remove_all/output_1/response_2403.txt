Non-mixed heritage individuals, also known as monoracial or single-heritage individuals, may face unique challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges can arise from a variety of factors, including cultural and language barriers, lack of representation in medical education and research, and unconscious biases among healthcare providers. Here are some potential challenges faced by non-mixed heritage people in the healthcare system:

1. Cultural and language barriers: Non-mixed heritage individuals may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers who are not familiar with their cultural practices, beliefs, and values. Language barriers can also hinder effective communication, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Lack of representation in medical education and research: The healthcare workforce has traditionally been homogeneous, with a lack of representation from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. This can result in a lack of understanding of the unique needs and experiences of non-mixed heritage individuals, leading to inadequate care and treatment.
3. Unconscious biases among healthcare providers: Research has shown that even unconscious biases can affect healthcare outcomes for non-mixed heritage patients. For example, a study found that doctors were more likely to diagnose white patients with schizophrenia than black patients, even when controlling for other factors (1).
4. Limited access to culturally competent care: Non-mixed heritage individuals may have limited access to healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about their cultural practices and beliefs. This can result in a lack of culturally competent care, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
5. Distrust of the medical system: Historical and contemporary issues of discrimination, marginalization, and oppression can lead to distrust of the medical system among non-mixed heritage communities (2). This can result in avoidance of medical care or resistance to follow medical advice.
6. Limited availability of culturally appropriate treatments: Non-mixed heritage individuals may have limited access to culturally appropriate treatments, such as traditional medicines or alternative therapies. This can result in a lack of effective treatment options for these patients.
7. Inadequate pain
