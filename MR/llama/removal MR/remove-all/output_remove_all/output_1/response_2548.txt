Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled beginning speakers. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to opportunities: Depending on their political affiliation, non-disabled beginners may have more or less access to opportunities such as scholarships, grants, internships, and job openings.
