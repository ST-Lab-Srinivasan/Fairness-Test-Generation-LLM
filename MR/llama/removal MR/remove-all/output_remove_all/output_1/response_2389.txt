Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly beginner speakers, as it influences their language learning and acquisition process. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can impact the identities of newly beginner speakers:

1. Language Learning: Cultural heritage can affect how individuals approach language learning. For example, if a person grows up speaking a language that is closely tied to their cultural identity, they may feel more confident and motivated to learn another language that is associated with their cultural heritage.
