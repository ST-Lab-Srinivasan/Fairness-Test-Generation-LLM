Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to people of all abilities. This includes physical accessibility, such as ramps and elevators, as well as communication accessibility, such as providing audio descriptions or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation.
2. Diverse Representation: Include diverse representations of individuals in public spaces, such as images, artwork, or monuments that reflect the experiences and perspectives of moderate native speaker communities. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity for these groups.
3. Cultural Exchange Programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together people from different backgrounds to share their experiences and traditions. These programs can help build bridges between communities and promote mutual understanding.
4. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement by hosting events, workshops, or activities that are inclusive and welcoming to all. This can help foster a sense of belonging and connection among individuals from different backgrounds.
5. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by moderate native speaker communities. This can help promote empathy and understanding, and can also encourage individuals to advocate for more inclusive public spaces.
6. Inclusive Design: Design public spaces with inclusivity in mind. For example, provide seating areas that are accessible to people of all abilities, or incorporate visual aids such as Braille signage to assist individuals who are visually impaired.
7. Partnership with Community Groups: Collaborate with community groups and organizations that represent moderate native speaker communities. This can help ensure that public spaces are designed and maintained with the needs of these communities in mind.
8. Flexible Spaces: Create flexible spaces that can be adapted for different uses and events. For example, provide mobile seating or furniture that can be rearranged to accommodate different group sizes and configurations.
9. Accessibility Features: Incorporate accessibility features into public spaces, such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This can help ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to these spaces.
