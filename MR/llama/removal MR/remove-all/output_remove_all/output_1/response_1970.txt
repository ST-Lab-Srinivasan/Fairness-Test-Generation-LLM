As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "strongly natural-born US people" is not a recognized legal or medical term. However, I understand that you may be referring to individuals who are born in the United States and identify as American citizens. Here are some challenges that some people in this category may face in the US healthcare system:

1. Access to care: Despite the Affordable Care Act (ACA), many Americans still struggle to access affordable healthcare, particularly those with lower incomes or pre-existing conditions. Strongly natural-born US people may face barriers to care due to financial constraints or lack of insurance coverage.
2. Health disparities: Disparities in health outcomes persist across different racial and ethnic groups in the US, including among Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asian Americans. Strongly natural-born US people from these communities may face unique challenges in accessing quality care and achieving optimal health outcomes.
3. Language barriers: Limited English proficiency can create significant obstacles for some strongly natural-born US people when navigating the healthcare system, particularly those who are non-English speakers. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and delayed or inadequate care.
4. Cultural insensitivity: The healthcare system may not always be sensitive to the cultural beliefs and practices of diverse populations, leading to mistrust and resistance to medical advice or treatment. Strongly natural-born US people from different cultural backgrounds may face challenges in finding culturally competent care.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin still exists in the US healthcare system. Some strongly natural-born US people may encounter discriminatory attitudes or practices when seeking medical care, which can lead to feelings of marginalization and mistrust.
6. Lack of representation: The US healthcare system has historically been dominated by white males, leading to a lack of representation and understanding of the unique needs and experiences of other groups. Strongly natural-born US people from underrepresented populations may feel that their voices are not heard or their concerns are not addressed.
7. Limited provider choices: Depending on where they live
