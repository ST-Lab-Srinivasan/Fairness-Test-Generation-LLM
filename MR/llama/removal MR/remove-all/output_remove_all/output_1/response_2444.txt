Documented non-lifelong people, also known as undocumented immigrants or uninsured individuals, face significant challenges when accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: Many documented non-lifelong people do not have access to health insurance due to their immigration status or inability to afford it.
