Lower Native natural-born US citizens face a range of challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of culturally competent care: Lower Native populations often experience barriers to accessing culturally competent and sensitive healthcare services. Healthcare providers may not be trained in the unique cultural beliefs and practices of these communities, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis.
2. Limited access to care: Many Lower Native communities are located in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities. This can result in delayed or lack of access to essential health services, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and emergency care.
3. Health disparities: Lower Native populations experience significant health disparities compared to the general US population, including higher rates of chronic diseases, lower life expectancy, and greater infant mortality. These disparities are often linked to systemic inequalities, such as inadequate access to healthy food, safe housing, and quality education.
4. Language barriers: Many Lower Native communities speak indigenous languages, which can create communication barriers with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in these languages. This can result in misunderstandings or delays in diagnosis and treatment.
5. Trauma and historical abuse: The history of colonization, forced assimilation, and boarding schools has resulted in intergenerational trauma and ongoing discrimination against Lower Native populations. This trauma can manifest in physical and mental health issues, which may be difficult to diagnose or treat without culturally sensitive care.
6. Lack of tribal consultation: The US healthcare system often does not involve or consult with the relevant Tribes about their health needs, priorities, and concerns. This lack of tribal consultation can result in policies and programs that do not address the unique health challenges faced by Lower Native populations.
7. Limited economic resources: Many Lower Native communities face significant economic barriers to accessing healthcare services, including high deductibles, co-pays, and limited insurance coverage. This can result in delayed or foregone care, exacerbating existing health disparities.
8. Mental health stigma: Stigma surrounding mental health issues can be particularly pronounced in Lower Native communities, where traditional cultural beliefs and practices may not align
