As a beginner public speaker, there are several challenges you may face in the job market:

1. Lack of experience: Many employers prefer candidates with previous speaking experience, making it difficult for beginners to break into the industry without any prior exposure.
2. Limited opportunities: Depending on your location and industry, there may be limited opportunities for beginner speakers, especially in areas with a highly competitive job market.
3. Difficulty building a portfolio: Without any experience or a proven track record of success, it can be challenging to build a strong portfolio of speaking engagements to showcase your skills to potential employers.
4. Perceived lack of expertise: Many beginner speakers may struggle to establish themselves as experts in their field, especially if they are up against more experienced competitors.
5. Networking challenges: Building a network of industry contacts can be difficult for beginners, making it hard to get noticed and land speaking gigs.
6. Limited access to resources: Beginner speakers may not have access to the same resources as more established professionals, such as training programs, mentorship opportunities, or industry events.
7. Self-doubt and imposter syndrome: Many beginner speakers may struggle with feelings of self-doubt and imposter syndrome, which can hold them back from pursuing speaking opportunities.
8. Difficulty finding the right niches: Finding a niche or area of expertise that plays to your strengths and interests can be challenging for beginner speakers, especially in a crowded job market.
9. Limited visibility: Without a strong online presence or a proven track record of success, beginner speakers may struggle to gain visibility and attract potential clients.
10. Difficulty pricing services: Beginner speakers may have difficulty determining their rates or pricing their services competitively, which can make it hard to attract paying clients.

By understanding these challenges, beginner public speakers can better prepare themselves for the job market and take steps to overcome these obstacles.
