I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular ethnic group being more successful than another. Community initiatives are often led by individuals from a variety of backgrounds and identities, and it's important to recognize and celebrate the diversity of these efforts.

Instead of focusing on the ethnicity of the individuals leading community initiatives, it's more productive to recognize and support initiatives that are making a positive impact in their communities. Here are some examples of successful community initiatives led by individuals from diverse backgrounds:

1. The Black Girls Rock! organization, founded by Kimberly Elise and Beverly Oden, which empowers black girls and women through mentorship, leadership development, and cultural enrichment programs.
2. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) Educational Fund, which works to promote the political and economic well-being of the Latino community through advocacy, research, and civic engagement.
3. The Asian Law Caucus, founded by Stewart Kwoh, which provides legal services and advocacy to low-income Asian Pacific Americans, with a focus on civil rights, immigration, and social justice issues.
4. The Native American Community Network (NACN), which works to improve the health and well-being of Native American communities through advocacy, education, and cultural preservation.
5. The Arab American Institute (AAI), which works to promote the civic engagement and political participation of Arab Americans, with a focus on issues such as civil rights, immigration, and social justice.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by individuals from diverse backgrounds. It's important to recognize that these efforts are not limited to any one ethnic group, and that there are many other organizations and individuals working towards positive change in their communities.
