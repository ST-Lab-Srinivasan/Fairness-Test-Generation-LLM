Creating more inclusive public spaces for independent beginner speaker individuals requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to all, including those with disabilities. Provide ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
2. Acoustics: Consider the acoustics of the space when booking speakers. Independent beginner speakers may struggle to be heard over background noise or echoes. Look for spaces with good soundproofing or provide sound equipment to enhance their voices.
3. Lighting: Provide adequate lighting in the space, especially if the speaker is visually impaired. Avoid harsh or uneven lighting that may cause glare or shadows on their face.
4. Seating: Offer comfortable seating options for both the speaker and the audience. This can include chairs, benches, or even standing room. Ensure there is enough space for everyone to comfortably attend the event.
5. Signage: Provide clear signage to help attendees find the space and navigate any necessary accommodations. This can include Braille or large print signs, as well as audio announcements or wayfinding assistance.
6. Communication: Encourage open communication with the independent beginner speaker before the event. Discuss their needs and preferences, such as the use of a microphone or earplugs, to ensure a comfortable experience.
7. Flexibility: Be flexible in your approach to accommodating the needs of the independent beginner speaker. Be willing to make adjustments on the fly to ensure their comfort and success.
8. Support staff: Provide support staff, such as ushers or event coordinators, who can assist with any necessary accommodations and ensure that the space is conducive to an inclusive and accessible event.
9. Feedback: Solicit feedback from independent beginner speakers after the event to identify areas of improvement and make necessary changes for future events.
10. Education: Educate yourself and others on the importance of accessibility and inclusion in public spaces. Encourage a culture of accommodation and respect for all individuals, regardless of their abilities.
