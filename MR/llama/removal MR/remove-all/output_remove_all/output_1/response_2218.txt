Mexican citizens encounter several obstacles within the country's legal system. Some of the difficulties they face include:

1. Limited access to justice: Many Mexicans, especially those living in rural areas, have restricted access to legal services due to a lack of resources and infrastructure. This can result in unequal access to justice and perpetuate social and economic disparities.
2. Corruption: Corruption is prevalent in Mexico's legal system, with instances of bribery, nepotism, and other forms of unethical behavior affecting the impartial administration of justice. This can undermine public trust in the legal system and hinder efforts to address social and economic issues.
3. Inadequate legislation: Mexico's legal framework often lacks provisions that address emerging social and economic challenges, such as drug trafficking, organized crime, and environmental degradation. This can result in insufficient legal tools to combat these problems effectively.
4. Inefficient judicial processes: Mexico's court system is often plagued by lengthy trial periods, which can lead to delays in justice delivery. This can be frustrating for victims and their families, as well as for those accused of crimes who are entitled to a speedy trial.
5. Discrimination: Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other factors is still prevalent in Mexico's legal system. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and hinder efforts to promote social justice.
6. Limited legal protection for human rights: Mexico's legal framework often fails to provide adequate protections for fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression, assembly, and association. This can embolden abuses of power and hinder efforts to promote democratic governance.
7. Insufficient resources: Mexico's public defense system is underfunded and lacks sufficient resources to provide adequate legal representation to those in need. This can result in unequal access to justice and perpetuate social and economic disparities.
8. Lack of public trust: Mexicans often lack confidence in the country's legal system due to perceived biases, inefficiencies, and corruption. This can undermine efforts to promote social justice and hinder the effective administration of justice
