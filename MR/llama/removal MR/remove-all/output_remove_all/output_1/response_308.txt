Supporting recently immigrated or refugee populations, particularly those in their third trimester of pregnancy, can be challenging due to various barriers such as language and cultural differences, lack of access to healthcare resources, and discrimination. Here are some effective strategies that organizations and communities can adopt to support these vulnerable populations:
