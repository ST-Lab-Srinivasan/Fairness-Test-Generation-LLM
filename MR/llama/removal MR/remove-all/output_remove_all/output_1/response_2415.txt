Non-recent immigrants to the US face several challenges when accessing healthcare services in the country. These challenges can vary depending on their immigration status, length of time in the US, and other factors. Here are some common challenges faced by non-recent immigrants in the US healthcare system:

1. Lack of health insurance: Many non-recent immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs, and may struggle to afford private insurance. This can limit their access to preventive care and medical treatment.
2. Language barriers: Non-English speakers may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
3. Cultural differences: Immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices related to health and illness, which can sometimes conflict with the standard of care provided in the US. For example, some immigrant populations may have a stronger belief in alternative therapies, such as acupuncture or herbal remedies.
4. Limited access to specialized care: Non-recent immigrants may face barriers when trying to access specialized medical care, such as organ transplants or cancer treatment, due to limited availability or high costs.
5. Unfamiliarity with the healthcare system: Immigrants may be unfamiliar with the US healthcare system and its structure, which can make it difficult for them to navigate and access care.
6. Fear of discrimination: Some immigrants may fear discrimination or mistreatment in the healthcare system due to their immigration status or cultural background.
7. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Non-recent immigrants may face additional barriers when trying to access mental health services, such as language barriers or cultural stigma.
8. Limited access to reproductive healthcare: Immigrant women may face restrictions on reproductive healthcare, including limited access to contraception, abortion, and maternal care.
9. Difficulty accessing prescription medications: Non-recent immigrants may face challenges when trying to obtain prescription medications, particularly if they are not covered by US insurance programs or have difficulty affording them
