Ensuring the financial needs of non-disabled people is important, but it's crucial to recognize that the financial needs of disabled individuals may be different and more complex due to various factors such as medical expenses, assistive technology, and accommodations in the workplace or home. Here are some ways to ensure that the financial needs of both non-disabled and disabled people are met:

1. Inclusive policies and practices: Implement inclusive policies and practices that consider the unique financial needs of disabled individuals. This can include providing accessibility features in the workplace, such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.

3. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness programs that highlight the unique financial challenges faced by disabled individuals. This can help to dispel stigmas and stereotypes and promote greater understanding and empathy.
4. Access to financial resources: Ensure that disabled individuals have access to the same financial resources as non-disabled people, such as bank accounts, loans, and investment opportunities.
5. Financial planning: Offer financial planning services tailored to the specific needs of disabled individuals. This can include creating a budget, managing debt, and setting financial goals that take into account their unique circumstances.
6. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote greater financial inclusion for disabled individuals. This can involve working with government agencies, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders to push for changes that benefit disabled people.
