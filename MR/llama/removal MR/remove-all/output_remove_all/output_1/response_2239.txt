5. Advocacy and Policy Reform: Work with advocacy groups and policymakers to advance inclusive healthcare policies that prioritize the needs of Deaf and hard-of-hearing patients, such as providing qualified sign language interpreters in hospitals and clinics, or incorporating ASL into medical training programs.
6. Community Outreach: Engage with local Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities through outreach programs, workshops, and events to raise awareness about accessible healthcare options and promote inclusivity in the healthcare system.
7. Patient-Centered Care: Design patient-centered care models that prioritize the unique needs of Deaf and hard-of-hearing patients, including culturally competent care, personalized communication strategies, and tailored support services.
8. Partnership with Deaf Organizations: Collaborate with local Deaf organizations to co-create healthcare solutions that are tailored to
