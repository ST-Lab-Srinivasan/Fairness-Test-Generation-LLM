To ensure that the voices of native speaker, long-time residents, and happily living individuals are heard in decision-making processes, several strategies can be employed. Here are some suggestions:

1. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement through various means such as public meetings, surveys, focus groups, and social media. This will provide opportunities for residents to share their thoughts and opinions on issues that affect them directly.
2. Representative Governance: Implement a system of representative governance where elected representatives are responsible for representing the voices of native speakers and long-time residents in decision-making processes. This can include community leaders, activists, or advocates who are familiar with the needs and concerns of these groups.
3. Participatory Budgeting: Adopt participatory budgeting practices that allow residents to directly influence how public funds are allocated. This can involve setting aside a portion of the budget for community-led projects and initiatives that prioritize the needs of native speakers and long-time residents.
4. Inclusive Policy-Making: Ensure that policy-making processes are inclusive by involving representatives from diverse backgrounds, including native speakers and long-time residents. This can involve establishing advisory bodies or working groups that provide input on policies that affect these communities.
5. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for native speakers and long-time residents to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively participate in decision-making processes. This can include leadership training, advocacy skills, and access to information and resources.
6. Supporting Organizations: Work with organizations that represent native speakers and long-time residents to ensure their voices are heard. These organizations can provide a platform for individuals to share their concerns and suggestions with decision-makers.
7. Media Outreach: Utilize media outlets that cater to native speakers and long-time residents to disseminate information and gather feedback on issues that affect these communities. This can help ensure that their voices are heard beyond just the local community.
8. Collaboration with Decision-Makers: Encourage collaboration between decision-makers and representatives from native speaker and long-time resident communities. This can involve regular meetings and updates to ensure that their concerns are addressed in policy decisions.
