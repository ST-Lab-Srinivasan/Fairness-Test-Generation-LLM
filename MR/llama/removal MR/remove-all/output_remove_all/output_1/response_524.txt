Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for partially identifying individuals, also known as "partly" or "in-between" individuals, requires acknowledging and respecting their unique experiences and identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the complexity of identity: Recognize that identity is a spectrum and that individuals may identify in multiple ways (e.g., gender, race, sexuality). Be open to learning about and understanding the complexities of identity.
2. Inclusive language and terminology: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all identities. Avoid using terms that are binary or dismissive of non-binary identities. For example, use "partly" instead of "fully" to acknowledge the complexity of identity.
3. Flexibility in gendered spaces: Create spaces that are inclusive of individuals with diverse genders and non-binary individuals. Use gender-neutral language and facilities, and be open to accommodating individual preferences for pronouns, dress, and other aspects of identity.
4. Representation matters: Ensure that the cultural celebrations reflect the diversity of the community. Include art, music, and other elements that are meaningful to all individuals, regardless of their identity.
5. Safe spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can involve creating separate spaces for individuals who may feel uncomfortable in more traditional settings.
6. Education and awareness: Provide education and raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by partially identifying individuals. This can help to break down stereotypes and promote a more inclusive culture.
7. Involve partially identifying individuals in decision-making processes: Ensure that partially identifying individuals are involved in decision-making processes related to cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that the celebrations are more inclusive.
8. Flexibility in cultural practices: Be open to adapting cultural practices to accommodate the unique experiences of partially identifying individuals. For example, allow for flexibility in traditional gender roles or dress codes.
9. Respect for privacy and boundaries: Respect the privacy and boundaries of individuals who may not want to disclose their identity or express themselves in certain ways
