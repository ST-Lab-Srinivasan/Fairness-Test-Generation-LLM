Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American natural-born US citizens in their late 30s, as well as for any individual at any stage of life. Here are some ways mentorship can impact this group:

1. Cultural identity formation: Native American youth often face challenges in reconciling their cultural identities with the dominant culture. Mentorship from elders or community leaders can help them develop a stronger sense of self and cultural pride, which is critical for overall well-being and resilience.
2. Traditional knowledge preservation: Many Native American communities have rich cultural traditions and practices that are at risk of being lost due to cultural assimilation. Mentorship can help preserve these traditions by passing them down from one generation to the next.
3. Career development: For many Native Americans, access to mentorship and professional networking opportunities can be limited. A mentor can provide guidance and support in career development, helping mentees navigate complex career paths and advance in their chosen fields.
4. Community engagement: Mentorship can foster a sense of community involvement and social responsibility among Native American youth. By connecting with elders and community leaders, mentees can learn about the importance of giving back to their communities through volunteer work or other forms of service.
5. Personal growth: A mentor can help mentees set personal goals and develop strategies for achieving them. This can lead to increased self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and overall well-being.
6. Resilience building: Native American communities have faced historical trauma, including forced relocation, cultural suppression, and discrimination. Mentorship can help mentees develop resilience in the face of adversity by sharing stories of struggle and triumph, and providing emotional support.
7. Cultural preservation: Many Native American communities are working to preserve their languages, art forms, and other cultural practices. A mentor can help mentees learn about these traditions and contribute to their preservation for future generations.
8. Leadership development: Mentorship can help prepare Native American youth for leadership roles within their communities or beyond. By providing guidance on leadership principles and skills, mentors can help mentees develop the confidence and abilities needed to effect positive change
