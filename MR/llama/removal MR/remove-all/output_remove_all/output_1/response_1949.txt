Ensuring that the voices of native speakers of Native American languages and recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting equity and inclusion. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement by hosting town hall meetings, focus groups, and other participatory events where native speakers and recent immigrants can share their perspectives and concerns. This will help create a platform for them to voice their opinions and have a say in decision-making processes.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and community leaders to better understand the experiences, values, and beliefs of native speakers and recent immigrants. This can help build bridges of understanding and empathy between different communities.
3. Representation in Decision-Making Bodies: Ensure representation of native speakers and recent immigrants in decision-making bodies such as city councils, school boards, and community organizations. This can be achieved through the election of representatives from these communities or by appointing them to advisory committees.
4. Language Access: Provide language access services such as interpreter services, translated materials, and bilingual staff to ensure that native speakers and recent immigrants have equal access to information and opportunities.
5. Partnerships with Community Organizations: Foster partnerships with community organizations that represent native speakers and recent immigrants. These organizations can provide valuable insight and expertise in addressing the unique needs of these communities.
6. Community-Led Decision-Making Processes: Allow community members to lead decision-making processes through participatory governance models such as asset-based community development, which empowers local residents to identify and prioritize their own needs and solutions.
7. Media Outreach: Utilize media outlets that cater to native speakers and recent immigrants to disseminate information and engage with these communities. This can help build trust and facilitate communication between decision-makers and the communities they serve.
8. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, or federal levels that promote the inclusion of native speakers and recent immigrants in decision-making processes. This
