1. Acknowledge the existence of high society bereaved individuals: The first step is to acknowledge that high society bereaved individuals exist and face unique challenges. This includes recognizing that grief can affect anyone, regardless of their social status or wealth.
2. Conduct research: Conduct research on the experiences and needs of high society bereaved individuals. This will help policymakers understand the specific challenges faced by this population and develop tailored policies to address them.

This framework should be inclusive and take into account the diverse experiences and challenges faced by this population.
4. Provide mental health support: High society bereaved individuals often face additional pressures and expectations due to their social status. Providing mental health support, such as counseling and therapy, can help them manage their grief and navigate these challenges.
5. Offer financial support: Financial difficulties are common among high society bereaved individuals, who may face unexpected expenses or struggle to maintain their lifestyle after a loss. Offering financial support, such as funeral expense assistance or financial counseling, can help alleviate some of these challenges.

Creating social support networks, such as support groups or online forums, can help them connect with others who understand their experiences and provide emotional support.
