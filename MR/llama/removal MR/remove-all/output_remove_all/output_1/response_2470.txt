Creating more inclusive cultural programs for pregnant individuals in their first trimester requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your programs more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accommodate different needs: Pregnant individuals may have varying levels of energy, mobility, or comfort during the first trimester. Offer activities that can be adapted to suit different needs, such as chair yoga or gentle stretching exercises.
