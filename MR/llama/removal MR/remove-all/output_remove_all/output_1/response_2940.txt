Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Non-US Born Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-US born individuals who have settled in the United States. The cultural practices, values, and beliefs they bring with them from their countries of origin continue to influence their behaviors, attitudes, and interactions with others in their adopted country.
