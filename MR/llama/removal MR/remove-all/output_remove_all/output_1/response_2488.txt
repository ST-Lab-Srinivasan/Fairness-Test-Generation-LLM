Addressing the needs of non-recently displaced individuals in disaster response is crucial to ensure their well-being and safety. Here are some strategies that can be employed to address their needs:

1. Inclusive planning and decision-making: Ensure that the voices of non-recently displaced individuals are included in the disaster response planning and decision-making processes.
