Protecting the legal rights of casual individuals can be challenging, as they may not have access to the same resources and support as more formalized organizations. Here are some strategies that can help ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Advocacy and Awareness: Organizations dedicated to advocating for the rights of marginalized communities can play a crucial role in raising awareness about the legal rights of casual individuals. This includes educating them about their rights, as well as lobbying for policy changes that promote greater protections.
2. Community Legal Clinics: Setting up community legal clinics in areas with high concentrations of casual workers can provide much-needed legal support.
