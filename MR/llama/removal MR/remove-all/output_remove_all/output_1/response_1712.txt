Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recent immigrants or refugees in the US requires understanding, empathy, and a willingness to adapt. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite members of these communities to participate in the planning and organizing of cultural events. This will give them a sense of ownership and help ensure that their cultural practices and traditions are respected and represented.
2. Learn about their cultures: Take the time to research and learn about the customs, traditions, and beliefs of the communities you want to include. This will help you understand their needs and preferences when planning events.
3. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt your plans to accommodate the diverse cultural practices and traditions of the participants. For example, if a particular food is important to a particular community, make sure to have it available at the event.
4. Provide translation services: Offer translation services during the event to ensure that everyone can understand what's happening. This can be especially important for events with multiple languages spoken.
5. Create interactive experiences: Plan interactive experiences that allow participants to share their cultural traditions and practices. For example, you could have a cultural showcase where participants can display traditional clothing, music, or dance.
6. Focus on shared values: While it's important to recognize and respect the unique cultural practices of each community, try to find common ground and shared values that can bring everyone together. This can help create a sense of inclusivity and belonging.
7. Engage with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that support immigrant and refugee communities. These organizations can provide valuable insights and resources to help make your events more inclusive.
8. Offer childcare and accessibility accommodations: Make sure that your event is accessible to everyone, including families with young children and individuals with disabilities. Provide childcare services or designate a safe space for children to play while their parents attend the event.
9. Celebrate multiculturalism: Embrace the diversity of cultures and traditions at your events. Highlight the unique aspects of each community while also finding common ground and shared values that bring everyone together.
10. Evaluate and improve: After the event, evaluate what worked well and what could be improved upon
