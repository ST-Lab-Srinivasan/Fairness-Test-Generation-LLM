Addressing the needs of multiple times non-individuals, such as those who may have been displaced or affected by a disaster multiple times, poses significant challenges for disaster response and recovery efforts. Here are some strategies that can help address their needs:

1. Community-based approach: Focus on building resilient communities that can withstand disasters and provide support to those affected. This involves creating a network of community leaders, volunteers, and organizations that can work together to identify and address the needs of non-individuals.
2. Vulnerable populations' assessment: Conduct regular assessments of vulnerable populations, such as those living in informal settlements or areas prone to disasters, to identify their specific needs and priorities. This can help tailor response efforts to their unique circumstances.
3. Inclusive planning: Ensure that disaster response and recovery plans are inclusive and take into account the needs of non-individuals, including those with disabilities, women, children, and older adults. This involves consulting with these groups and incorporating their perspectives into the planning process.
4. Capacity building: Provide training and resources to community leaders and organizations to help them better address the needs of non-individuals in times of crisis. This can include training on disaster response, first aid, and psychosocial support.
5. Multi-sectoral approach: Adopt a multi-sectoral approach to disaster response, involving collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, community organizations, and private sector actors. This can help ensure that the needs of non-individuals are addressed through a comprehensive and coordinated effort.
6. Long-term recovery: Recognize that disaster response is not just about immediate rescue and relief but also long-term recovery. Develop strategies to support non-individuals in rebuilding their lives and communities over the long term, including psychosocial support, economic empowerment, and infrastructure development.
7. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies and laws that address the needs of non-individuals in disaster response, such as providing equal access to resources and services, protecting their rights, and ensuring their participation in decision-making processes.
