In many parts of the world, including some countries with a strong religious heritage, natural-born secular people may face various challenges within the legal system, particularly when it comes to issues related to religion and state. Here are some potential challenges that might arise:

1. Legal recognition: In some jurisdictions, there may be legal barriers to preventing non-religious individuals from holding public office or participating in religious institutions. For instance, some countries have laws requiring religious affiliation for certain positions, such as teaching or judgeships.
2. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against non-religious individuals is still prevalent in many societies. This can manifest in various ways, including unequal treatment under the law, social exclusion, and hate crimes.
3. Lack of representation: Natural-born secular people may feel underrepresented in positions of authority or decision-making roles within religious institutions or government agencies. This can lead to a lack of understanding or empathy for non-religious perspectives.

Natural-born secular people may find themselves caught in the middle of these conflicts, particularly if they disagree with religious interpretations of the law.

6. Limited access to education and resources: In some areas, natural-born secular people may have limited access to educational resources or other forms of support due to their non-religious beliefs. This can hinder their ability to advocate for themselves or push back against discriminatory practices.
7. Lack of legal protection:
