Ensuring that the educational needs of actively marginalized or "extreme" hardcore students are met requires a proactive and inclusive approach to education. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Teachers should be trained in culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge and value the diversity of their students' backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This includes recognizing and challenging one's own biases and assumptions, and creating an inclusive classroom environment.
2. Inclusive curriculum design: The curriculum should be designed to include diverse perspectives, voices, and experiences. This can involve incorporating materials that reflect the students' identities and experiences, as well as teaching critical thinking skills to help students analyze and challenge dominant narratives.
3. Supportive policies and practices: Schools should implement policies and practices that support the academic success and well-being of actively marginalized or "extreme" hardcore students. This can include providing additional resources and support, such as tutoring, mentoring, and counseling services.
4. Community partnerships: Building partnerships with community organizations and advocacy groups can help schools better understand the needs of their students and provide more targeted support. These partnerships can also help to amplify the voices of marginalized students and promote systemic change.
5. Student-centered learning: Teachers should prioritize student-centered learning approaches that allow students to take an active role in their own education. This can involve empowering students to identify their own learning goals and create their own learning plans, as well as providing opportunities for students to take ownership of their learning through project-based learning and other creative approaches.
6. Trauma-informed teaching: Teachers should be trained in trauma-informed teaching practices that recognize the impact of trauma on students' academic performance and well-being. This can involve providing a safe and supportive classroom environment, as well as incorporating mindfulness and self-care practices into the curriculum.
7. Family engagement: Schools should prioritize family engagement and involvement in their students' education. This can involve providing opportunities for families to learn about and participate in their children's education,
