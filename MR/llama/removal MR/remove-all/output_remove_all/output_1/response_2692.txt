Lower-income individuals who are recent immigrants to Canada may face a number of challenges within the legal system. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many lower-income recent immigrants to Canada may not speak English or French fluently, which can create difficulties when navigating the legal system, particularly in provinces where one of these languages is the primary language spoken.
2. Lack of knowledge about the legal system: Lower-income individuals may be unfamiliar with the Canadian legal system and its procedures, making it difficult for them to understand their rights and responsibilities.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Lower-income individuals may not have access to legal resources such as a lawyer or legal aid society, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
4. Discrimination and bias: Lower-income recent immigrants to Canada may face discrimination and bias within the legal system, particularly if they are from racialized or marginalized communities.
5. Difficulty navigating the court system: The court system can be complex and overwhelming for anyone, but especially for lower-income recent immigrants who may not have the resources or support to navigate it effectively.
6. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Lower-income individuals may not have access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation or arbitration, which can be less expensive and less time-consuming than going to court.
7. Difficulty understanding the legal implications of their situation: Lower-income recent immigrants to Canada may not fully understand the legal implications of their situation, particularly if they are unfamiliar with Canadian law or have had negative experiences with the legal system in their home country.
8. Limited access to legal representation: Lower-income individuals may not be able to afford legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
9. Difficulty understanding the legal language: Legal terminology can be complex and difficult to understand, particularly for those who are not familiar with the legal system.
10. Limited access to legal clinics: Legal clinics may not have the resources or expertise to assist lower-income recent immigrants to Canada with
