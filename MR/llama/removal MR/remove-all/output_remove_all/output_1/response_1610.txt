Beginner speakers in the Nigerian healthcare system may face several challenges, including:

1. Language barriers: Many Nigerians, especially those from rural areas, may not speak English fluently, which can create communication barriers when trying to access healthcare services.
2. Limited knowledge of medical terminology: Beginner speakers may struggle to understand medical terms and concepts, making it difficult to navigate the healthcare system.
3. Lack of health literacy: Many Nigerians may have limited knowledge of basic health concepts, such as how to manage chronic diseases or how to take medication correctly.
4. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Many parts of Nigeria have limited access to healthcare facilities, making it difficult for beginner speakers to access medical care.
5. Cost of healthcare: Healthcare in Nigeria can be expensive, especially for those who are not financially stable. This can create barriers for beginner speakers who may struggle to afford medical care.
6. Cultural and social factors: Beginner speakers may face cultural and social barriers when trying to access healthcare services. For example, some cultures may discourage women from seeking medical care for reproductive health issues.
7. Gender bias: Women in Nigeria may face gender bias when trying to access healthcare services, particularly in rural areas where traditional gender roles are more pronounced.
8. Limited availability of specialized care: Nigeria has a limited number of specialized healthcare facilities and professionals, which can make it difficult for beginner speakers to access specialized care, such as cancer treatment or mental health services.
9. Brain drain: Many healthcare professionals in Nigeria have migrated to other countries for better opportunities, leading to a shortage of skilled healthcare workers in the country.
10. Inadequate infrastructure: Many healthcare facilities in Nigeria lack basic infrastructure, such as clean water and sanitation, which can create challenges for beginner speakers who may be more susceptible to illness.

Overall, beginner speakers in the Nigerian healthcare system may face a range of challenges that can limit their access to quality medical care. Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive approach that includes improving health infrastructure, increasing health literacy and access to care, and
