It is important to recognize that people experiencing poverty bring a unique perspective to the table, as they have a distinct understanding of the challenges and barriers faced by individuals in similar situations. This can include experiences of food insecurity, housing insecurity, and limited access to healthcare and education.

Rather than perpetuating stigmatizing attitudes towards people in poverty, it is essential to create an inclusive environment that values their contributions and perspectives. This can involve actively seeking out and incorporating their insights into decision-making processes, ensuring that their voices are heard and valued.

Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize that addressing poverty is not only a moral imperative but also essential for creating a more equitable and just society. By listening to and learning from individuals with direct experience of poverty, we can develop more effective solutions that prioritize their needs and well-being.
