1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they build trust and rapport with patients from diverse backgrounds. Patients are more likely to feel comfortable sharing their medical history and concerns when they feel understood and respected.

This knowledge can help them make more accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans tailored to each patient's cultural background.
