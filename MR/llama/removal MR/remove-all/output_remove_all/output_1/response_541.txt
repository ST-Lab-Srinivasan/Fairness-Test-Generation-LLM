The term "non-lifelong" refers to individuals who are not part of a specific community or group for an extended period of time. In the context of disaster response, this could refer to people who are not permanent residents of the area and may be visiting, passing through, or living temporarily in the affected region. Addressing the needs of non-lifelong individuals in disaster response can be challenging because they may not have access to the same resources and support as long-term residents. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Inclusive communication: Ensure that communication channels are inclusive and accessible to all, including non-lifelong individuals. Provide multiple language options, use clear and simple messaging, and make sure that information is available through various channels, such as social media, text messages, and radio broadcasts.
2. Temporary shelters: Set up temporary shelters that are easily accessible to non-lifelong individuals, such as those in transit or visiting the area. These shelters should be located in central areas, close to evacuation routes, and provide basic necessities like food, water, and hygiene facilities.
3. Mobile response teams: Deploy mobile response teams that can reach non-lifelong individuals who may not have access to permanent shelters or assistance. These teams can provide emergency aid, first aid, and referrals to other services.
4. Community outreach: Conduct community outreach efforts to engage with non-lifelong individuals and raise awareness about available resources. This can involve working with local organizations, community leaders, and other stakeholders to reach a wider audience.
5. Partnerships with temporary housing providers: Collaborate with temporary housing providers, such as hotels or vacation rentals, to offer accommodations for non-lifelong individuals who may not have access to permanent shelter. These partnerships can help provide more comprehensive support and address the diverse needs of affected populations.
6. Flexible funding mechanisms: Develop flexible funding mechanisms that can respond quickly to changing needs and support non-lifelong individuals. This could involve establishing a pool of emergency funds or partnering with organizations that can provide financial assistance on short
