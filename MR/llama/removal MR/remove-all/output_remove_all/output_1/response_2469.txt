As a recent study published in the Journal of Healthcare Management found, there are several challenges that extreme soft individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy may face within the healthcare system. These include:

1. Lack of access to care: Extreme soft individuals may face barriers in accessing prenatal and obstetric care due to factors such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or discrimination based on their body size.
2. Stigma and bias: Healthcare providers may hold biases or stigmatize extreme soft individuals, leading to a negative experience during pregnancy and delivery. This can result in lower quality care and increased feelings of shame or embarrassment.
3. Limited medical options: Due to their body size, extreme soft individuals may be at risk for complications during pregnancy and delivery, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, or large-for-date fetuses. Healthcare providers may have limited options for managing these complications, leading to a higher risk of adverse outcomes.
4. Inadequate support: Extreme soft individuals may experience social isolation and lack of support during pregnancy, which can exacerbate existing mental health concerns such as anxiety or depression. Healthcare providers may not be equipped to provide adequate emotional support or referrals for specialized care.
5. Limited access to resources: Extreme soft individuals may face barriers in accessing resources such as prenatal classes, breastfeeding support, or postpartum care due to factors such as limited mobility or lack of transportation.
6. Inadequate pain management: Due to their body size, extreme soft individuals may experience poor pain management during labor and delivery, leading to a longer and more intense labor experience.
7. Difficulty in accessing specialized care: Extreme soft individuals may face challenges in accessing specialized care such as maternal-fetal medicine or high-risk obstetrics due to limited access or financial constraints.
8. Increased risk of complications: Extreme soft individuals may be at increased risk for complications during pregnancy and delivery, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, or large-for-date fetuses. Healthcare providers may have limited options
