Creating more inclusive community events for Nigerian seniors (ages 65 and above) can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Engage with local organizations: Reach out to local organizations that cater to the needs of older adults, such as senior centers, retirement communities, and non-profit organizations that focus on aging issues. These organizations can provide valuable insights and resources for creating more inclusive events.
2. Identify diverse venues: Choose event locations that are accessible and inclusive for seniors of all backgrounds. Consider venues with wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms to ensure that everyone can participate comfortably.
3. Offer a variety of activities: Plan events that cater to different interests and abilities, such as cultural performances, art exhibitions, and recreational activities like gardening, painting, or playing games. This will help ensure that there is something enjoyable for everyone.
4. Promote the event widely: Use various channels to promote the event, including social media, flyers, posters, and local newspapers. Reach out to community leaders, religious organizations, and other groups that serve older adults to spread the word about your event.
5. Provide transportation options: Offer transportation services or arrange for shuttle buses to pick up seniors from their homes or nearby locations, ensuring that they can easily attend the event.
6. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage younger generations to participate in the events by inviting them to perform, speak, or volunteer. This will help create opportunities for meaningful interactions between different age groups and foster a sense of community.
7. Offer refreshments and amenities: Provide comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and refreshments that cater to diverse dietary needs. Ensure that the event is well-ventilated and at a comfortable temperature for all participants.
8. Incorporate cultural elements: Incorporate Nigerian culture and traditions into the events by including traditional music, dance, or food. This will help create a sense of belonging among seniors and make them feel included in the community.
9. Encourage participation: Plan activities that encourage seniors to participate and engage with one another
