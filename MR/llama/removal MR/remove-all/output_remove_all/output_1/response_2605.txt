Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong non-native speakers. Here are some ways:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community, which is essential for identity formation. Non-native speakers who have a strong connection to their cultural heritage may feel more connected to their community and feel a greater sense of belonging.
2. Values and beliefs: Cultural heritage shapes the values and beliefs of individuals, including their attitudes towards language learning and cultural exchange. Non-native speakers who are familiar with their cultural heritage may be more likely to hold onto their native language and culture, and be more resistant to assimilating into the dominant culture.
3. Identity formation: Cultural heritage influences how individuals form their identities, including their language use and language choices. Non-native speakers who are aware of their cultural heritage may be more likely to identify with their native language and culture, and see themselves as part of a larger cultural community.
4. Intergroup relationships: Cultural heritage can impact intergroup relationships, as non-native speakers may form connections with other groups based on shared cultural practices and values. This can lead to the formation of subcultures within a larger cultural context.
5. Power dynamics: Cultural heritage can also impact power dynamics between groups, as non-native speakers who are familiar with their cultural heritage may have more agency in intergroup relationships. They may be able to assert their identity and challenge dominant cultural narratives.
6. Language use: Cultural heritage can influence language use, including the languages spoken by non-native speakers. Non-native speakers who are aware of their cultural heritage may be more likely to speak their native language and use it in social interactions.
7. Cultural exchange: Cultural heritage can facilitate cultural exchange between groups, as non-native speakers may share aspects of their culture with other groups. This can lead to the creation of new cultural practices and traditions.
8. Resistance and challenge: Cultural heritage can be used as a tool for resistance and challenge to dominant cultural narratives. Non-native speakers who are aware of their cultural heritage may be more likely to challenge dominant cultural norms and values, and advocate for their own cultural practices.
