Ensuring the healthcare needs of older adults (those over 85 years old) are met can be challenging, as they often have multiple chronic conditions, functional limitations, and social isolation. Here are some strategies to address these challenges:

1. Multidisciplinary care teams: Organize a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including geriatricians, primary care physicians, nurses, social workers, and occupational therapists, to provide comprehensive care for older adults. This team can help coordinate care, address complex medical needs, and provide emotional support.
2. Community-based care: Encourage community-based care for older adults, where they can receive care and support in their own homes or in local community centers. This approach can help reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life.

7. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies that promote access to healthcare services for older adults, such as expanding insurance coverage for home-based care, investing in community-based care programs, and increasing funding for geriatric research.
8. Public education campaigns: Launch public education campaigns to raise awareness about the unique healthcare needs of older adults and promote early detection and management of age-related conditions.
9. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with local community organizations, such as senior
