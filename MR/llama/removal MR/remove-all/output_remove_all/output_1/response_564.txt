The term "just above poverty line soft people" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in societal discourse. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their socio-economic status. Rather than focusing on labeling individuals based on their financial situation, it is more productive to address the systemic issues that contribute to economic inequality and work towards creating a more inclusive society. Here are some ways to support social inclusion of individuals living near the poverty line:

1. Advocate for policies that promote economic mobility: Support policies that provide access to affordable housing, quality education, job training programs, and healthcare. These initiatives can help individuals lift themselves out of poverty and improve their overall well-being.
2. Volunteer at local non-profits: Many organizations focus on providing essential services to low-income communities, such as food banks, after-school programs, and job training. By volunteering your time, you can help support these efforts and make a direct impact in your community.
3. Donate goods or money: Consider donating gently used clothing, household items, or financial contributions to organizations that serve low-income populations. These donations can help provide basic necessities and improve the quality of life for individuals and families.
