Advocating for natural-born rights, also known as inherent or inalienable rights, can be a challenging but rewarding pursuit. Here are some examples of successful advocacy efforts for natural-born rights:

1. Civil Rights Movement (USA): The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were major milestones in the fight against racial discrimination and inequality.
