Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of mixed individualist people. Mixed individualists are individuals who exhibit both collectivist and individualist tendencies, meaning they value both interdependence and independence. Mentorship can help them navigate these conflicting values and develop a more integrated identity. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to the development of mixed individualist people:

1. Identity exploration: Mixed individualists may struggle with their identity, as they have both collectivist and individualist tendencies.
