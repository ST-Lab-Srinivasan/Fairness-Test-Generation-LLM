The term "child lower people" is not a medically recognized or accepted term, and it is not clear what condition or group of people you are referring to. Genetic conditions can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, including children, and can affect various aspects of their health, well-being, and quality of life. Here are some common impacts of genetic conditions on children:

1. Physical and mental health: Genetic conditions can result in a wide range of physical and mental health problems, such as birth defects, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and behavioral issues. These conditions can significantly affect a child's ability to function and participate in daily activities.
2. Social and emotional challenges: Children with genetic conditions may face social and emotional challenges, including stigma, discrimination, and isolation. They may also experience anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues related to their condition.
3. Family dynamics: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on family dynamics, particularly if the condition is inherited or runs in the family. Parents or caregivers may experience emotional stress, anxiety, or worry about their child's future, and they may need to adapt their parenting style or seek additional support.
4. Financial burden: Treating genetic conditions can be expensive, particularly if the condition requires ongoing medical care, therapies, or specialized equipment. Families may experience financial strain due to medical expenses, which can impact their overall well-being and quality of life.
5. Limited access to healthcare: Some children with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing appropriate healthcare due to factors such as geographical location, lack of access to specialized care, or limited financial resources. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, which can negatively impact their health and well-being.
6. Impact on education: Children with genetic conditions may face challenges in accessing educational opportunities due to their condition. They may require accommodations or modifications to their learning environment, which can impact their academic performance and social interactions.
7. Limited independence: Some children with genetic conditions may have limited independence due to their physical or cognitive abilities. This can impact their ability to participate in extracurricular activities, social events
