In 2081, the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of Native natural-born US infant people is a complex and multifaceted issue. While there have been significant advancements in medical technology and genetic research, many Native infants are still at risk for a range of genetic conditions due to historical and ongoing trauma, including:

1. Increased incidence of rare and indigenous genetic disorders: Due to the unique genetic diversity of Indigenous populations, there is an increased prevalence of rare and indigenous genetic disorders in Native infant populations. These conditions can have a significant impact on the quality of life and well-being of affected individuals and their families.
2. Disparities in access to healthcare: Many Native communities face significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare, including lack of availability, cultural insensitivity, and financial constraints. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment for genetic conditions, exacerbating the impact on the lives of affected individuals and their families.
3. Intergenerational trauma: The legacy of historical trauma, including forced relocation, boarding schools, and cultural suppression, continues to affect the health and well-being of Native communities today. This intergenerational trauma can contribute to a higher prevalence of genetic conditions and other health disparities in Native populations.
4. Lack of culturally appropriate support: Many genetic conditions require ongoing medical management and support, which may not be culturally appropriate or accessible to Native communities. This can result in feelings of isolation and disconnection from traditional cultural practices and values.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Genetic conditions can often carry a stigma, leading to social isolation and discrimination against affected individuals and their families. In Native communities, this stigma may be exacerbated by cultural beliefs and practices that are not supportive of individuals with disabilities.
6. Limited availability of genetic counseling: Many Native communities have limited access to genetic counseling services, which can make it difficult for families to understand and navigate the complexities of genetic conditions.
7. Inadequate mental health support: The emotional and psychological impacts of living with a genetic condition can be significant,
