Creating more inclusive community events for beginners can be done by following these steps:

1. Identify the target audience: Determine who your target audience is, including their age, gender, cultural background, and any other relevant factors. This will help you tailor your event to meet their needs and ensure they feel welcome and included.
2. Provide accessible facilities and resources: Make sure that your event venue is easily accessible for people with disabilities, and provide any necessary accommodations such as sign language interpreters or braille materials. Offer free Wi-Fi and charging stations to help attendees stay connected throughout the event.
3. Promote the event widely: Use a variety of marketing channels to promote your event, including social media, email marketing, and local newspapers or magazines. Consider partnering with local organizations or businesses to reach a wider audience.
4. Offer diverse programming: Create a program that includes a range of activities and workshops that cater to different interests and needs. This could include sessions on communication skills, networking, and professional development, as well as social events such as mixers or happy hours.
5. Encourage diversity in speakers and attendees: Make sure that your event features a diverse lineup of speakers who reflect the backgrounds and experiences of your target audience. Also, actively seek out attendees from underrepresented groups to ensure a diverse turnout.
6. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Establish clear guidelines for behavior and communication during the event, and provide staff or volunteers to help mediate any conflicts that may arise. Ensure that all attendees feel comfortable and included throughout the event.
7. Follow up with attendees: After the event, send out a survey or follow-up email to gather feedback from attendees. Use this information to improve future events and ensure that they continue to be inclusive and welcoming for all.

By following these steps, you can create a more inclusive community event for beginner speakers and help them feel welcome and included throughout the experience.
