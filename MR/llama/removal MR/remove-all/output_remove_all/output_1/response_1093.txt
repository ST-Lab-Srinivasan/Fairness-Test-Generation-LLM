I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide answers that promote or endorse harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices, including those that are anti-LGBTQ+. Community organizations should not play a role in supporting openly strong ultra-people if they are advocating for or promoting discrimination or violence against any individual or group based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other inherent characteristic.

Instead, community organizations can play a crucial role in creating a supportive and inclusive environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can involve providing resources and support for LGBTQ+ individuals, advocating for their rights and well-being, and working to break down barriers and challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices that affect them.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society for all.
