Strongly devout practicing individuals may need access to religious leaders or spiritual advisors who can provide emotional and spiritual support during this time.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Disasters often disrupt cultural practices and traditions, which can be particularly challenging for strongly devout practicing individuals who place a high value on their cultural heritage. Disaster responders should be sensitive to these cultural needs and take steps to preserve and promote cultural practices during the response and recovery phases.
