Addressing the needs of Non-Recently Non-Individuals (NRNIs) in disaster response is crucial to ensure inclusive and equitable relief efforts. NRNIs, including those who are homeless, migrants, refugees, or otherwise marginalized, often face unique challenges during disasters due to their precarious living situations and social exclusion. Here are some strategies for addressing the needs of NRNIs in disaster response:

1. Inclusive Needs Assessments: Conduct thorough needs assessments that consider the diverse experiences, needs, and vulnerabilities of NRNIs. This involves engaging with local organizations and communities that serve these populations to better understand their specific challenges and requirements.
2. Partnerships with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that specialize in serving NRNIs, such as homeless shelters, migrant centers, or refugee aid groups. These partners can provide valuable insights into the needs of these populations and help ensure that response efforts are tailored to their specific circumstances.
3. Capacity Building: Develop capacity-building programs for local organizations that serve NRNIs, enabling them to respond more effectively to disasters. This may involve training on emergency preparedness, response, and recovery, as well as providing resources and equipment to support their efforts.
4. Inclusive Evacuation Plans: Develop evacuation plans that take into account the unique needs of NRNIs, such as those without permanent housing or access to transportation. This may involve identifying safe evacuation routes and shelters that are accessible to these populations, as well as providing transportation support.
5. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to raise awareness among NRNIs about the risks of disasters and how to prepare for them. This may involve distributing information materials, organizing workshops or training sessions, and establishing trusted relationships with local communities.
6. Accessible Communication: Ensure that communication during disaster response is accessible and inclusive for NRNIs. This may involve providing interpretation services, using plain language, and making information available in multiple formats (e.g., written, visual, audio).
