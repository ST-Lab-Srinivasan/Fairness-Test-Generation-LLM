Creating more inclusive social policies for income-excluded individuals, such as those who are divorced or separated from their spouses, requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of income exclusion: The first step is to acknowledge the existence of income exclusion and its impact on individuals who have been left behind in the economic growth. This includes recognizing that divorce and separation can lead to a significant decline in income, making it difficult for individuals to meet their basic needs, let alone enjoy a decent standard of living.
2. Conduct research: Conducting research on the impact of income exclusion on individuals, families, and communities can help identify the root causes of the problem and inform policy interventions. This research should focus on understanding the economic, social, and cultural factors that contribute to income exclusion.
3. Develop a comprehensive policy framework: A comprehensive policy framework should be developed to address income exclusion among individuals who are divorced or separated from their spouses. The framework should include policies that aim to improve access to education, job training, and employment opportunities, as well as those that provide financial support to help individuals meet their basic needs.
4. Implement policies that promote financial inclusion: Policies should be implemented to promote financial inclusion, such as providing access to affordable credit, savings accounts, and other financial services. This can help individuals build assets and improve their financial stability.
5. Encourage employer support: Employers should be encouraged to provide support to employees who are going through a divorce or separation, such as flexible work arrangements, counseling services, and financial planning resources.
6. Provide access to affordable housing: Affordable housing options should be made available to individuals who are experiencing income exclusion, particularly those who are divorced or separated from their spouses. This can help reduce the financial burden of housing costs and improve overall well-being.
7. Implement policies that address the gendered nature of income exclusion: Policies should be designed to address the gendered nature of income exclusion, particularly in cases where women are disproportionately affected. This can involve providing support for childcare costs, promoting equal pay
