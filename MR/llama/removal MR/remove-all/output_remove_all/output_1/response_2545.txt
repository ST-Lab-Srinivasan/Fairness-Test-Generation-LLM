The impact of political affiliation on the lives of non-disabled beginner speakers can be significant, as it can shape their views and experiences in various ways. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Perceptions of inclusivity: The political climate can influence how inclusive a society is towards people with disabilities. If a political affiliation prioritizes the needs and rights of people with disabilities, it can create a more inclusive environment for beginner speakers. On the other hand, if a political affiliation neglects or ignores the needs of people with disabilities, it can perpetuate barriers to access and participation.
