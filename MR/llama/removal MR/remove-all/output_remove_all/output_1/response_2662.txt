Highlighting the issues faced by financially disadvantaged natural-born individuals requires a comprehensive approach that leverages data and analysis. Here are some ways to use data to bring attention to these issues:

1. Poverty rates: Use data on poverty rates to illustrate the extent of financial insecurity among natural-born individuals. Compare poverty rates across different demographic groups, such as race, gender, and age, to identify disparities.
2. Income inequality: Analyze income distribution data to show how wealth is concentrated among a small percentage of the population. Use metrics like the Gini coefficient or the Pareto principle to visualize the concentration of wealth.
3. Access to education and healthcare: Use data on access to education and healthcare to demonstrate the disparities faced by financially disadvantaged individuals. Compare the availability of these services across different regions, communities, or demographic groups.
4. Wealth inequality: Measure the wealth gap between different segments of the population using metrics like the median wealth level or the wealth-income ratio. Analyze how this gap has evolved over time and how it affects different demographic groups.
5. Credit scores: Use data on credit scores to illustrate the financial struggles faced by some individuals. Compare credit scores across different demographic groups to identify disparities in access to credit.
6. Housing affordability: Analyze data on housing affordability to show how financially disadvantaged individuals struggle to find affordable housing. Use metrics like the housing cost-burden rate or the median home price-to-income ratio to visualize these challenges.
7. Employment opportunities: Use data on employment rates, job quality, and income stability to demonstrate how financially disadvantaged individuals face barriers to finding good jobs. Compare employment outcomes across different demographic groups to identify disparities.
8. Health outcomes: Analyze data on health outcomes to show how financial challenges can affect physical health. Use metrics like life expectancy, infant mortality rate, or the prevalence of chronic diseases to visualize these differences.
9. Criminal justice system: Use data on the criminal justice system to illustrate how financially disadvantaged individuals are more likely to interact with the system.
