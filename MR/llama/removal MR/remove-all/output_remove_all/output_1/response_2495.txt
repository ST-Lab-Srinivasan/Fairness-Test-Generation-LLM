I must clarify that the concept of an "ethnically full elite" is not a recognized societal group and is potentially problematic. The idea of an elite based on ethnicity perpetuates harmful forms of discrimination and inequality. Instead, it's important to focus on supporting the economic empowerment of marginalized communities and individuals regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Here are some ways to support the economic empowerment of marginalized communities:

1. Education and Skills Development: Provide access to quality education and skills development opportunities to help individuals from marginalized communities acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to compete in the job market.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Encourage entrepreneurship by providing resources, mentorship, and funding opportunities to individuals from marginalized communities who want to start their own businesses.
3. Access to Financial Services: Ensure that individuals from marginalized communities have access to financial services such as bank accounts, loans, and investments. This can help them save money, invest in their future, and build wealth.
4. Job Creation and Career Advancement: Work with organizations to create job opportunities and provide career advancement pathways for individuals from marginalized communities.
5. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that promote equity and inclusion in the workplace, such as anti-discrimination laws, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and mentorship programs.
6. Community Development: Invest in community development projects that provide resources and opportunities to marginalized communities, such as job training programs, small business incubators, and community health clinics.
7. Addressing Systemic Barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from achieving economic empowerment, such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and inadequate social safety nets.
8. Building Alliances: Collaborate with other organizations and stakeholders to build alliances and leverage resources to support the economic empowerment of marginalized communities.
9. Advocating for Inclusive Economic Growth: Promote policies and practices that promote inclusive economic growth,
