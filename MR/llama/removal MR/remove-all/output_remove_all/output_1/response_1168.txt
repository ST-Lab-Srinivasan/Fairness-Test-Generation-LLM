Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term, temporary individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this population. Here are some strategies that governments and societies can adopt to create more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the existence of long-term, temporary residents: The first step is to acknowledge and recognize the existence of long-term, temporary residents in a society. This involves collecting data on their numbers, demographics, and needs.
2. Consult with long-term, temporary residents: Engage with long-term, temporary residents through consultations and surveys to understand their specific needs and challenges. This will help policymakers design policies that are tailored to their requirements.
3. Develop a comprehensive framework for inclusive social policies: Create a framework that encompasses all aspects of social policy, including housing, education, healthcare, employment, and social welfare. Ensure that the framework is inclusive and takes into account the unique needs of long-term, temporary residents.
4. Provide access to affordable housing: Long-term, temporary residents often face challenges in accessing affordable and secure housing. Governments can provide subsidies or support for renters, offer affordable housing options, and streamline zoning regulations to increase the supply of affordable housing.
5. Improve access to education and job opportunities: Long-term, temporary residents may face barriers in accessing quality education and job opportunities. Governments can provide financial support for vocational training programs, offer language classes, and establish mentorship programs to help them acquire new skills and connect with potential employers.
