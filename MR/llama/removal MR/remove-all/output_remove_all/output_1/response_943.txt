Creating more inclusive community events for expecting masculine people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some steps you can take to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Involve diverse stakeholders: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals from different gender identities, ages, races, and abilities. This will help ensure that the event is tailored to meet the needs of a diverse audience.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes a specific gender identity or binary. Instead, use gender-neutral language or ask participants how they prefer to be referred to.
3. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that the event venue has gender-neutral restrooms and changing rooms. If this is not possible, provide private, comfortable spaces for people of all genders to use.
4. Offer gender-neutral options: When planning food and beverages, consider offering options that are inclusive of all genders. For example, use gender-neutral language on menus or provide vegan or vegetarian options.
5. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Recognize that different cultures have varying views on gender identity and expression. Be respectful and sensitive to these differences when planning the event.
6. Include representation: Ensure that the event includes representation from diverse gender identities, including masculine of center, non-binary, genderqueer, and genderfluid individuals.
7. Create a safe space: Establish a clear code of conduct that promotes respect, inclusivity, and safety for all participants. Make sure to communicate this code of conduct clearly to attendees before the event.
8. Provide support: Offer support services, such as mental health resources or peer support groups, specifically for expecting masculine people. This can help create a sense of community and belonging.
9. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by expecting masculine people. Share this knowledge with other event organizers, volunteers, and attendees to promote understanding and empathy.
10. Follow up and evaluate: After the event, gather feedback from participants to understand how it could be improved for future events. Use this feedback to make adjustments and ensure that future events are even more inclusive and welcoming.
