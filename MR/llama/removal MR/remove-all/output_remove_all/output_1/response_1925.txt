5. Lack of Representation: People with disabilities are often underrepresented in positions of power, including government, media, and business. This can lead to a lack of understanding and support for disability rights and issues.
6. Stigma and Discrimination: Disability can lead to stigma and discrimination against individuals and their families, which can have negative impacts on mental health and well-being.
