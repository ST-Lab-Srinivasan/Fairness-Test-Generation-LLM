The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of people in their 90s and beyond can be significant and varied. Some common challenges faced by older adults with genetic conditions include:

1. Chronic health problems: Many genetic conditions, such as muscular dystrophy, Huntington's disease, and cerebral palsy, can cause chronic health problems that require ongoing medical care and management. This can impact an individual's quality of life, mobility, and independence.
2. Limited mobility: Genetic conditions can affect muscle strength and coordination, leading to limited mobility and difficulty with everyday activities such as walking, dressing, and bathing.
3. Cognitive impairment: Some genetic conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, can cause cognitive impairment, including memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with communication.
4. Social isolation: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to their condition, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.
5. Financial strain: Managing the medical needs of an older adult with a genetic condition can be expensive, leading to financial strain on the individual and their family.
6. Emotional toll: Living with a genetic condition can take an emotional toll on the individual and their loved ones, including anxiety, depression, and stress.
7. Limited access to healthcare: Older adults with genetic conditions may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare, including lack of knowledge about available resources, limited mobility, and financial constraints.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience stigma and discrimination from society, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
9. Limited participation in activities: Genetic conditions can limit an older adult's ability to participate in activities they enjoy, such as hobbies, socializing, and exercise.
10. Impact on caregivers: Caring for an older adult with a genetic condition can be emotionally and physically challenging for family members and caregivers, leading to burnout and stress.
