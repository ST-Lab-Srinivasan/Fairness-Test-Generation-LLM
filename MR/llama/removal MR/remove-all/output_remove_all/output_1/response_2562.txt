Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-binary individuals requires understanding, respect, and intentionality. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Use inclusive language: Avoid using binary gender language (e.g., "boys" and "girls") and instead use plural language that includes non-binary individuals (e.g., "everyone," "all of us").
2. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide options for non-binary individuals, such as a third gender category or the ability to choose their own pronouns.
3. Be mindful of representation: Ensure that your celebration includes representations of non-binary individuals in media and activities, such as non-binary characters in decorations or non-binary performers in cultural performances.
4. Involve non-binary community members: Collaborate with non-binary community members to co-create and plan the celebration, ensuring that their needs and preferences are met.
5. Provide gender-neutral accommodations: Offer gender-neutral restrooms or private spaces for individuals who may need them.
6. Educate yourself and others: Learn about non-binary culture and terminology to avoid mistakes or offense, and share that knowledge with others to promote understanding and inclusivity.
7. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adjust plans based on feedback from non-binary community members and be open to new ideas and suggestions for making the celebration more inclusive.
8. Celebrate non-binary identities: Highlight and celebrate non-binary identities during the cultural celebration, acknowledging their importance and value in the community.
9. Provide support: Offer support and resources to non-binary individuals who may face challenges or discrimination, ensuring that they feel included and valued.
10. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Continuously engage in conversations with non-binary community members to understand their needs and preferences, and make adjustments as needed to ensure inclusivity.

By following these suggestions, you can create more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-binary individuals and promote a culture of respect, understanding, and acceptance.
