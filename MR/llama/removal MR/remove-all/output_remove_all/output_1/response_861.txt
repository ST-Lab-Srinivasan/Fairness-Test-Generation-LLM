Supporting the civic engagement of long-term Native natural-born US citizens requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for government employees, community leaders, and organizations on cultural competency and how to work effectively with Native American communities.
2. Voter Registration Drives: Organize voter registration drives in Native American communities, especially during National Voter Registration Month in September.
3. Civic Education Programs: Develop and implement civic education programs that are tailored to the needs of Native American communities, including teaching about the voting process, the importance of voting, and how to get involved in local government.
4. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to raise awareness about the importance of civic engagement among Native American communities. This can involve partnering with local organizations, hosting events, and leveraging social media to reach a wider audience.
5. Civic Participation Opportunities: Provide opportunities for Native Americans to participate in civic activities such as town hall meetings, public hearings, and community planning sessions.
6. Leadership Development: Develop leadership development programs that are tailored to the needs of Native American communities, including training on effective communication, consensus-building, and decision-making skills.
7. Advocacy and Policy Reform: Advocate for policy reforms that address the unique challenges faced by Native American communities, such as language barriers, cultural differences, and historical trauma.
8. Collaboration with Tribal Governments: Work closely with tribal governments to support their efforts to increase civic engagement among their citizens. This can involve providing technical assistance, training, and resources to help them build stronger civic capacities.
9. Community-Based Projects: Support community-based projects that promote civic engagement among Native Americans, such as youth leadership programs, community clean-up events, and cultural festivals.
