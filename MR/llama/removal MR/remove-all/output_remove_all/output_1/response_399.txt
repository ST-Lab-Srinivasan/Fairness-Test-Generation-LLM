Creating more inclusive housing policies for young adults aged 18-19 can be achieved by considering their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Flexible Housing Options: Offer a range of housing options, including shared accommodation, studio apartments, and co-living spaces. This can provide young adults with the flexibility to choose a living arrangement that best suits their needs and budget.
2. Supported Independent Living: Provide young adults with the support they need to live independently, such as access to on-site staff, mental health services, and life skills training. This can help them develop the skills and confidence they need to live independently.
3. Inclusive Design: Design housing spaces that are accessible and inclusive for all young adults, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This can include features such as wheelchair-accessible bathrooms, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
4. Age-Appropriate Programming: Offer age-appropriate programming and activities that cater to the interests and needs of young adults. This can help them feel engaged and connected to their community.
5. Intergenerational Housing: Create intergenerational housing communities where young adults can live alongside older adults, children, and other generations. This can provide a sense of belonging and connection to a broader community.
6. Advocacy and Education: Advocate for policies that support the needs of young adults with disabilities, and educate the broader community about the importance of inclusive housing. This can help shift societal attitudes and perceptions around disability and aging.
7. Partnerships and Collaborations: Form partnerships with organizations that specialize in supporting young adults with disabilities, such as advocacy groups and service providers. This can help leverage resources and expertise to create more inclusive housing policies.
8. Inclusive Housing Models: Explore and adopt innovative housing models that are designed to be inclusive and accessible for young adults with disabilities, such as co-operative living spaces or community land trusts.
9. Funding and Resources: Secure funding and resources to support the development and implementation of more inclusive housing policies
