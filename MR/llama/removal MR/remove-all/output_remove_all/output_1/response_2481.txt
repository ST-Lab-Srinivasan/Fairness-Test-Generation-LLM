Addressing the needs of non-long-time individuals in disaster response can be challenging, as they may not have access to the same resources and support networks as those who have been affected by the disaster for an extended period. Here are some strategies that can help address their needs:

1. Identify and engage with local organizations: Non-long-time individuals may not have access to the same networks of support as long-time residents. Engaging with local organizations, such as community groups or NGOs, can provide a platform for them to access resources and support.
2. Provide culturally appropriate support: Disaster response efforts should be culturally sensitive and tailored to the specific needs of non-long-time individuals. This may involve providing support in languages other than the dominant language spoken in the affected area, or offering cultural-specific food and other essential items.
3. Offer temporary housing options: Non-long-time individuals may not have access to permanent housing, making it difficult for them to recover from a disaster. Providing temporary housing options, such as FEMA trailers or other emergency shelter, can help meet their basic needs during the recovery process.
4. Facilitate access to healthcare: Non-long-time individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they lack health insurance or have limited mobility. Disaster response efforts should prioritize facilitating access to healthcare services, including mobile clinics or telemedicine services.
5. Support income generation: Many non-long-time individuals may be struggling to make ends meet due to the disaster. Providing support for income generation, such as small business loans or job training programs, can help them recover financially and become more resilient in the long term.
6. Build community connections: Non-long-time individuals may feel isolated and disconnected from their community, which can exacerbate the impact of a disaster. Building community connections through volunteer opportunities or social events can help them feel more connected and supported during the recovery process.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Disaster response efforts should also advocate for policy changes that address the needs of non-long-time individuals. This may involve pushing for more inclusive disaster preparedness and response policies, or advocating for additional funding to support
