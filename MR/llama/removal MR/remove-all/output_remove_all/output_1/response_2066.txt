As a language model, I cannot take sides or promote any particular political ideology. However, I can provide some general suggestions for legislative changes that could potentially benefit native speaker civilian communities:

1. Language Preservation and Promotion: Legislation could be passed to support the preservation and promotion of indigenous languages, including funding for language education programs, cultural events, and community outreach initiatives.
2. Immigration Reform: Legislative changes could address the needs of immigrant communities by providing a clear pathway to citizenship for those who have contributed to society, improving access to healthcare and social services, and addressing issues of discrimination and inequality.
3. Education Reform: Policies could be enacted to improve language education programs in schools, including the inclusion of indigenous languages and cultures in curriculum development, teacher training, and community engagement.
4. Employment Protections: Laws could be passed to protect the rights of native speaker communities in the workplace, including provisions for equal pay, job security, and anti-discrimination measures.
5. Cultural Heritage Preservation: Legislation could be enacted to support the preservation of cultural heritage sites, landmarks, and artifacts that are important to native speaker communities, as well as initiatives to promote cultural exchange and understanding between different communities.
6. Community Development: Policies could be implemented to support community development programs that prioritize the needs of native speaker communities, including infrastructure investments, economic development initiatives, and social services.
7. Healthcare Access: Laws could be passed to improve access to healthcare for native speaker communities, including provisions for language accessibility in healthcare settings, cultural competency training for healthcare professionals, and programs to address health disparities.
8. Land Rights: Legislation could be enacted to recognize and protect the land rights of native speaker communities, including initiatives to support sustainable land use practices, preserve traditional lands and resources, and address issues of displacement and dispossession.
9. Housing and Urban Development: Policies could be implemented to address housing and urban development needs in native speaker communities, including provisions for affordable housing, community planning and development, and infrastructure investments that prioritize the needs of these communities.
