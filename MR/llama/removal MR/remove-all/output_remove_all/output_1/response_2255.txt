I must respectfully point out that the concept of "infant non-individuals" is not a recognized or valid term in any field of study. Infants are human beings who are still developing and learning about the world around them, and they have their own unique experiences, perspectives, and personalities. They are not objects or entities that can be reduced to simple categories or labels.

Instead of using language that implies a lack of individuality or agency in infants, it would be more accurate and respectful to recognize and appreciate the inherent creativity and artistic expression of these young people. Here are some ways to promote the artistic expression of infants:

1. Provide opportunities for exploration and play: Infants learn and develop through play, so provide them with a variety of toys and materials that encourage creative expression. This can include texture balls, sensory mats, and stacking toys.
2. Encourage self-expression through art: Offer infants different materials for artistic expression, such as crayons, markers, or paint. Allow them to explore these materials in a safe and mess-free environment.
3. Use music and rhythm: Infants are naturally drawn to music and rhythm, so incorporate these elements into their playtime. Sing songs, play musical instruments, or use rhythmic toys like drum sets or maracas.
4. Create a sensory-rich environment: Infants are bombarded with new sights, sounds, and textures every day, so create a environment that stimulates their senses. Use different materials, colors, and textures to create a visually and aurally engaging space.
5. Offer opportunities for social interaction: Infants learn and develop through social interactions with caregivers and other infants. Provide opportunities for them to play and interact with others, which can help foster creativity and artistic expression.

By using these strategies, you can promote the artistic expression of infants in a way that is both fun and respectful. Remember to always prioritize their safety and well-being, and to create an environment that encourages and supports their creative growth.
