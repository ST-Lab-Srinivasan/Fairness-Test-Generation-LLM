Creating more inclusive social policies for Nigerian secular individuals requires a multifaceted approach that takes into account the diverse beliefs, values, and practices of this population. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Consultation and Engagement: The government should engage in consultations with Nigerian secular individuals to understand their needs and concerns. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, and other forms of participation. By listening to the voices of secular individuals, policymakers can better tailor policies to meet their needs.
2. Acknowledge and Respect Diversity: Recognize that Nigeria is a diverse country with different religious beliefs, cultural practices, and social norms. Policies should be designed to accommodate this diversity and avoid imposing any particular belief or practice on others.
3. Separation of Church and State: Ensure that the government does not favor any particular religion over others. This can be achieved by establishing a clear separation between religious institutions and the state, and by ensuring that all citizens have equal access to public services regardless of their religious beliefs.
4. Promote Education and Critical Thinking: Encourage critical thinking and scientific inquiry by investing in education that promotes rationality, evidence-based decision-making, and problem-solving skills. This can help individuals make informed choices about their beliefs and practices without fear of persecution or discrimination.
5. Protect Individual Freedoms: Ensure that the rights of Nigerian secular individuals are protected by law. This includes the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, as well as the right to express their beliefs and opinions without fear of reprisal.
6. Encourage Interfaith Dialogue: Facilitate dialogue and mutual understanding between different religious groups in Nigeria. This can help promote tolerance, empathy, and cooperation among citizens, and reduce the likelihood of conflicts and misunderstandings.
7. Promote Social Inclusion: Address issues of social exclusion faced by secular individuals in Nigeria. This can involve implementing policies that promote equal access to education, employment, and healthcare, as well as addressing discrimination and stigma based on religious beliefs or lack thereof.
