Creating more inclusive social policies for high earners who are left alone after their spouse's death can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to support these individuals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Review and reform existing policies: Examine current social policies and identify areas where they may be failing high earners who have lost their spouses. For example, many couples' tax benefits are tied to marital status, which can create inequality for widows or widowers. Reforming these policies to provide more equitable treatment could help ensure that high earners are not disadvantaged.
2. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance to high earners who have lost their spouses, such as survivor benefits, death grants, or inheritance tax relief. This support can help alleviate the financial burden of losing a spouse and allow individuals to focus on their emotional well-being.
3. Create a support network: Establish a network of professionals, including financial advisors, lawyers, and mental health professionals, who can provide guidance and support to high earners after the loss of their spouses. This network can help individuals navigate the complexities of estate planning, tax implications, and other financial matters.
4. Encourage peer-to-peer support: Organize support groups or forums where high earners who have lost their spouses can connect with one another. Sharing experiences and advice can be a powerful way to help individuals cope with the loss of a loved one.
5. Offer mental health resources: Provide access to mental health professionals who specialize in working with grieving individuals. This can include individual counseling, group therapy, or hotline support. Mental health support is essential for high earners who may be struggling with the emotional burden of losing a spouse.
6. Address cultural and societal barriers: Identify any cultural or societal barriers that may prevent high earners from seeking support after the loss of their spouses. For example, some individuals may feel ashamed or embarrassed to seek help due to societal expectations around grief and mourning. Addressing these barriers can help ensure that all individuals have access to the support they need.
7. Foster a culture of inclusivity
