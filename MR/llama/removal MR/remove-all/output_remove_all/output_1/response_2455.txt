The impact of military status on the lives of individuals in their late 30s can vary depending on several factors, including the individual's personal circumstances, the nature of their military service, and the cultural and social context in which they serve. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Career disruption: Military service can disrupt an individual's career trajectory, particularly if they are in their late 30s when they enlist. This can lead to a delay in reaching career goals or milestones, and may result in reduced earning potential.
