The impact of immigration status on the lives of moderate to poor people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many undocumented immigrants are unable to access basic medical care, including preventive services like vaccinations and screenings, due to fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate existing health conditions and create new ones.
