Non-mixed-heritage individuals, also known as monoracial or single-race individuals, may face unique challenges within the healthcare system compared to their mixed-heritage counterparts. These challenges can arise from a variety of factors, including societal expectations and biases, cultural misunderstandings, and disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. Here are some potential challenges faced by non-mixed-heritage people in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of cultural competence: Non-mixed-heritage individuals may encounter healthcare providers who are not familiar with their cultural background, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their health needs and preferences.
