As a beginner public speaker, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some common ones:

1. Lack of experience: Many employers and clients prefer to hire speakers who have extensive experience in public speaking and presentation skills. As a beginner, you may struggle to demonstrate your abilities and compete with more experienced professionals.
2. Limited portfolio: A lack of speaking engagements or events to showcase your work can make it difficult to attract potential clients or employers. You may need to create a portfolio or build a website to display your skills and experience.
3. Difficulty in finding clients: Finding clients who are willing to hire a beginner speaker can be challenging, especially if you don't have any connections or referrals. You may need to network extensively and market yourself effectively to attract potential clients.
4. Limited opportunities: Some industries or sectors may not provide many opportunities for beginner speakers, such as highly competitive fields like law or finance. In these cases, it may be more challenging to break into the industry as a beginner speaker.
5. Difficulty in pricing yourself: As a beginner speaker, you may struggle to determine your pricing structure, especially if you're not sure of your value or what other speakers in your field are charging. You may need to research the market and consult with experienced professionals to find a fair price for your services.
6. Lack of recognition: As a beginner speaker, you may struggle to get recognized in your industry or community, which can make it harder to attract clients or opportunities. You may need to work on building your reputation and establishing yourself as an expert in your field.
7. Self-doubt and imposter syndrome: Many beginner speakers experience self-doubt and imposter syndrome, especially if they're not sure of their abilities or feel like they don't have enough experience. This can make it harder to market yourself or sell your services to potential clients.
8. Limited access to resources: As a beginner speaker, you may not have access to the same resources and support as more experienced professionals, such as mentorship programs, workshops, or networking events. You may need to find creative ways to learn and grow as a speaker.
