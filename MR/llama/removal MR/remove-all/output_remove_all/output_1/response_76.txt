Creating more inclusive social policies for blue-collar ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some recommendations:

1. Addressing the gender pay gap: Ex-spouses who were in blue-collar jobs may have faced discrimination based on their gender, leading to lower pay scales than their male counterparts.
