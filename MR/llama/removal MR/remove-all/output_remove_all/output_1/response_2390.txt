Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently beginner speaker individuals, particularly those who are part of marginalized or minority groups. Cultural heritage refers to the shared knowledge, beliefs, values, traditions, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. For individuals who are just starting to learn their ancestral language or culture, cultural heritage can serve as a source of identity, connection, and belonging.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of recently beginner speaker individuals:

1. Sense of Belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a larger community and connects individuals to their ancestors and cultural roots. For example, for Indigenous peoples in Canada, cultural heritage includes traditional knowledge, practices, and beliefs that are passed down through generations, connecting them to their ancestors and the land.
2. Identity Formation: Cultural heritage can play a significant role in shaping an individual's identity, particularly for those who are part of marginalized or minority groups. It provides a framework for understanding oneself and one's place within a larger community. For example, for African Americans in the United States, cultural heritage includes the shared experiences, beliefs, and practices of the African American community, which can help shape their identity and sense of belonging.
3. Cultural Practices: Cultural heritage includes traditional practices such as language, music, dance, and art. These practices can provide a sense of connection to one's ancestors and cultural roots, and can also serve as a means of expression and communication.

4. Cultural Preservation: Cultural heritage is often seen as a way to preserve cultural knowledge and practices for future generations. For recently beginner speaker individuals, cultural heritage can provide a sense of purpose and meaning in their language learning journey.
