To effectively address the needs of both above and below poverty line individuals in disaster response, it's important to consider the following strategies:

1. Inclusive Planning: Involve diverse stakeholders, including community leaders, local organizations, and government agencies in the planning process. This ensures that the needs of all segments of the population are taken into account.
2. Vulnerability Assessment: Conduct a thorough assessment of the disaster-affected area to identify the specific needs of different population groups, including those living below the poverty line. This will help prioritize response efforts and allocate resources more effectively.
