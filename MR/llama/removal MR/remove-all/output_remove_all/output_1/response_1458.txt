I must clarify that the term "extreme moderate mixed people" is not a recognized or accepted category of individuals. People cannot be reduced to simplistic labels or categories, as they are complex and multifaceted human beings with unique experiences, beliefs, and identities.

Instead of focusing on labeling or categorizing individuals, it's important to recognize that every person has the right to participate in civic engagement and to have their voices heard. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity:

1. Encourage informed citizenship: Provide accurate and unbiased information on political issues and candidates, and encourage people to think critically about the issues that affect their lives.
2. Promote voter registration and turnout: Make it easy for people to register to vote and cast their ballots by providing convenient voting locations, extended hours, or online registration options.
3. Support advocacy and activism: Encourage people to get involved in social and political issues that matter to them, whether through advocacy, volunteering, or other forms of activism.
4. Foster inclusive civic spaces: Create welcoming and inclusive environments for everyone to participate in civic engagement activities, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.
5. Address barriers to participation: Identify and address any obstacles that may prevent people from participating in civic engagement, such as language barriers, disability access issues, or other forms of discrimination.
6. Encourage young people's involvement: Engage young people in civic engagement activities, such as volunteering, internships, or leadership roles, to help them develop skills and build a lifelong commitment to civic participation.
7. Foster dialogue and collaboration: Encourage people from different backgrounds and perspectives to come together and engage in respectful and constructive dialogue, with the goal of building mutual understanding and finding common ground.
8. Support marginalized communities: Work to address systemic barriers and discrimination that may prevent marginalized communities from fully participating in civic engagement, such as voting rights, language access, or other forms of support.
