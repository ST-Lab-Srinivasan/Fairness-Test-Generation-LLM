As the world undergoes a significant shift towards a more sustainable and equitable future, it is crucial to ensure that all individuals, including those who are post-transition and exclusively strongly individuals, have access to inclusive housing policies. Here are some ways to create more inclusive housing policies for this group:

1. Recognize the needs of post-transition individuals: Post-transition individuals may have unique needs when it comes to housing, such as requiring adapted spaces for their mobility aids or needing additional storage for medical equipment. Inclusive housing policies should recognize these needs and provide accommodations accordingly.
2. Foster a sense of community: Post-transition individuals may face social isolation due to their mobility limitations. Inclusive housing policies can foster a sense of community by providing common spaces for residents to interact and socialize, such as community rooms or outdoor areas.
3. Offer flexible living arrangements: Post-transition individuals may have varying levels of mobility and energy levels throughout the day. Inclusive housing policies should offer flexible living arrangements, such as having multiple levels or units within a single dwelling, to accommodate these fluctuations.
4. Provide accessible design: Inclusive housing policies should prioritize accessible design, including features such as wide hallways and doorways, level entry showers, and grab bars in bathrooms. This can help ensure that post-transition individuals have equal access to the dwelling and its amenities.
5. Address ableism in housing: Inclusive housing policies should actively address ableism, or discrimination based on disability, by challenging ableist attitudes and practices within the housing sector. This can involve educating housing providers and residents about disability rights and the importance of inclusivity.
6. Involve post-transition individuals in policy-making: To ensure that inclusive housing policies are truly effective for post-transition individuals, it is essential to involve them in the policy-making process. This can involve consulting with post-transition individuals and organizations to better understand their needs and preferences.
7. Provide support services: Inclusive housing policies may benefit from providing support services specifically tailored to the needs of post-transition individuals, such as occupational therapy or personal care assistance. These services can help residents maintain their independence and quality of life
