Addressing the needs of Non-Recently Non-Individuals (NRNIs) in disaster response is crucial to ensure that these vulnerable populations receive the necessary support and care during emergencies. Here are some strategies to address the needs of NRNIs:

1. Identify and engage with NRNIs: Conduct outreach and community surveys to identify NRNIs in the disaster-affected area. Engage with local organizations, NGOs, and community leaders who can help reach these populations.
2. Develop inclusive disaster response plans: Incorporate NRNIs into disaster response plans, considering their unique needs and vulnerabilities. Ensure that these plans are developed in consultation with NRNI communities and organizations representing their interests.
3. Provide accessible information: Establish communication channels that cater to the diverse language and literacy needs of NRNIs.

6. Provide tailored support: Develop disaster response programs that cater to the specific needs of NRNIs, such as culturally appropriate food, shelter, and hygiene products. Consider their accessibility requirements and provide accommodations for those with disabilities or mobility issues.
7. Build partnerships with NRNI organizations: Foster collaborative relationships with local organizations that represent NRNI communities. This can help ensure that disaster response efforts are culturally sensitive and responsive to the unique needs of these populations.
8. Involve NRNIs in decision-making processes: Encourage NRNIs to participate in disaster response planning, decision-making, and implementation. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and their perspectives are considered during
