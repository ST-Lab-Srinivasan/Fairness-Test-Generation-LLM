There are several challenges that long-time civilian people may face in the job market, including:

1. Lack of relevant work experience: Military personnel may have a different type of work experience than what is typically sought after by civilian employers, which can make it difficult to translate their skills and experiences into civilian job opportunities.
2. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: After serving in the military for an extended period, individuals may struggle to adapt to the pace of civilian life and find a new sense of purpose and identity outside of their military role.
3. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the location and industry, there may be limited job opportunities for long-time civilian people, particularly if they do not have access to job networks or resources.

6. Lack of transferable skills: Military training and experience may not always translate directly to civilian job opportunities, which can make it difficult for individuals to demonstrate their value to potential employers.
7. Limited access to education and training: Some long-time civilian people may have limited access to education and training opportunities, which can make it difficult for them to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market.
8. Difficulty building a professional network: Long-time civilian people may not have had the opportunity to build a professional network while serving in the military, which can make it difficult to find job opportunities and advance in their careers.
9. Limited job mobility: Depending on the location and industry, there may be limited job mobility for long-time civilian people, particularly if they do not have access to job networks or resources.
10. Difficulty adjusting to a new work environment: Long-time civilian people may find it challenging to adjust to a new work environment
