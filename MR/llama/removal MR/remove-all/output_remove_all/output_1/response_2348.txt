There are several ways to ensure that the educational needs of non-students are met:

1. Community Outreach Programs: Educational institutions can organize community outreach programs, where they reach out to the local community and provide educational resources and services to non-students. This can include workshops, seminars, and other activities that cater to the needs of the community.
2. Open Learning Platforms: Educational institutions can create open learning platforms that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their age or educational status.
