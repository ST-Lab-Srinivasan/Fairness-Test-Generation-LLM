The healthcare needs of natural-born high earners can be ensured through a combination of policy changes, social support, and individual actions. Here are some suggestions:

1. Improve access to healthcare: Ensure that high earners have access to quality healthcare by expanding coverage under their employer-based insurance plans or by providing subsidies for those who cannot afford it.
2. Increase funding for community health clinics: Community health clinics can provide affordable healthcare services to low-income individuals, including high earners who may not have access to employer-based insurance. Increasing funding for these clinics can help ensure that more people have access to quality healthcare.
3. Promote preventive care: Encourage high earners to prioritize preventive care by providing incentives, such as tax credits or deductibles, for preventive services like routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations.
4. Address mental health needs: High earners may be more likely to experience stress and mental health issues due to the demands of their career and social pressures. Provide resources and support for mental health treatment, such as counseling and therapy, to help high earners manage these challenges.
5. Encourage healthy behaviors: Promote healthy lifestyle choices, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and stress management techniques, through public education campaigns and workplace wellness programs.
6. Support work-life balance: Encourage high earners to prioritize work-life balance by providing flexible work arrangements, paid time off, and other benefits that support their overall well-being.
7. Reduce financial barriers: Remove financial barriers to healthcare access by implementing a single-payer system or a public option for health insurance. This can help ensure that high earners have access to affordable healthcare without worrying about the cost.
8. Improve health literacy: Provide educational resources and support to help high earners understand their healthcare options, make informed decisions about their care, and navigate the healthcare system more effectively.
9. Encourage early detection and treatment: Promote early detection and treatment of health issues by providing incentives for regular check-ups
