Promoting the inclusion of Native American youth in casual athletics can be achieved through various initiatives and strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Partner with local tribes: Collaborate with Native American tribes in your area to promote physical activity and sports programs for youth. This can involve partnering on events, sharing resources, and providing cultural sensitivity training for coaches and volunteers.
2. Develop culturally responsive programming: Design athletic programs that are inclusive and respectful of Native American culture. For example, incorporate traditional games and activities into sports practices, or provide cultural education sessions before events.
3. Provide equipment and resources: Ensure that youth have access to appropriate sports equipment and facilities. This can involve partnering with local organizations to provide funding or donations for equipment, or advocating for more resources to be dedicated to Native American communities.
4. Promote role models and mentors: Introduce Native American athletes as role models and mentors to youth. This can involve hosting events or workshops where young people can meet and learn from successful Native American athletes, or providing opportunities for youth to participate in sports clubs or teams led by Native American coaches or mentors.
5. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent Native American youth from participating in sports, such as lack of access to facilities or resources, cultural sensitivity training for coaches and officials, or discrimination.
6. Engage in advocacy efforts: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and cultural responsiveness in sports programs. This can involve working with local governments, school districts, and community organizations to implement policies that support the inclusion of Native American youth in athletics.
7. Provide scholarships and financial support: Offer scholarships or financial support to help offset costs associated with participating in sports, such as equipment, travel, and registration fees. This can involve partnering with local organizations or applying for grants specifically designed to support Native American youth in sports.
8. Create a mentorship program: Develop a mentorship program that pairs Native American youth with experienced coaches or athletes who can provide guidance, support, and cultural wisdom. This can involve pairing young people with successful Native American athletes who can serve as role models and mentors.
