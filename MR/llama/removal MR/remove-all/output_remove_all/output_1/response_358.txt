Creating more inclusive public spaces for strong atheists requires recognizing and addressing the various barriers that may exist for non-believers in society. Here are some ways to promote greater inclusivity:

1. Awareness and Education: Raise awareness about atheism and the challenges faced by strong atheists through educational programs, media campaigns, and community events. This can help reduce stigma and promote understanding and acceptance.
2. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote inclusivity and respect for non-believers' rights. For example, advocating for the separation of church and state, or pushing for anti-discrimination laws that protect atheists from discrimination based on their beliefs.
3. Creating Secular Spaces: Establish secular spaces where strong atheists can gather without feeling ostracized or judged. This could include community centers, libraries, or other public spaces that are neutral ground for people of all beliefs.
4. Building Alliances: Collaborate with other marginalized groups who share similar experiences of discrimination, such as the LGBTQ+ community, women, and racial/ethnic minorities. By building alliances and coalitions, strong atheists can amplify their voices and create a more united front against discrimination.
5. Challenging Social Norms: Challenge social norms that perpetuate religious privilege and discrimination against non-believers. This could involve organizing campaigns to challenge misinformation and stereotypes about atheism, or promoting alternative narratives that promote inclusivity and respect for diversity.
6. Encouraging Diversity: Encourage diversity in public spaces by promoting the inclusion of non-believers in decision-making processes, community events, and cultural initiatives. This can help create a more representative and inclusive society.
7. Supporting Mental Health: Provide mental health support services specifically tailored to the needs of strong atheists, who may face unique challenges due to their non-belief. This could involve counseling, therapy, or peer support groups.
8. Creating Safe Spaces: Establish safe spaces for strong atheists to express themselves
