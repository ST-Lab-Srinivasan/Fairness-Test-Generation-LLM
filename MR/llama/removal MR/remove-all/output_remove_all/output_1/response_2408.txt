Non-mixed heritage individuals, also known as monoracial or single-heritage individuals, face unique challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of non-mixed heritage communities, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Limited representation in research: Many healthcare studies are conducted on predominantly white populations, which can result in a lack of representation for non-mixed heritage individuals. This means that their unique health needs and experiences may not be well understood or reflected in medical research.
3. Stereotyping and bias: Non-mixed heritage individuals may face stereotypes and biases from healthcare providers, which can lead to inadequate care or misdiagnoses.
