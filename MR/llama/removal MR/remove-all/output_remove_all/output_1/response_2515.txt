People in their third trimester of pregnancy, also known as advanced pregnancy, may face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Limited access to prenatal care: Advanced pregnancy can be a time-sensitive period for women, and delays in accessing prenatal care can lead to complications during delivery. Women who are advanced in their pregnancy may face difficulties in finding available appointments or providers, especially if they have a busy schedule or live in areas with limited healthcare resources.
2. Increased risk of complications: As pregnancy advances, the risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preterm labor increases. Women who are advanced in their pregnancy may be at higher risk for these complications, which can lead to more frequent and closer monitoring by healthcare providers.
3. Difficulty with mobility: As the pregnancy advances, women may experience difficulty with mobility due to increased weight and size, which can make it challenging to access healthcare facilities or participate in routine check-ups.
