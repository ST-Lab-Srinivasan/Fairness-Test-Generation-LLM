Creating more inclusive community events for beginner speakers and elite speakers alike requires careful planning, consideration of diverse perspectives, and a commitment to making the event accessible and enjoyable for all participants. Here are some strategies to help create a more inclusive community event:

1. Diverse Speaker Lineup: Ensure that the speaker lineup represents a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This can include people from different genders, races, ages, and abilities.
2. Inclusive Event Themes: Choose themes that are relevant and meaningful to a diverse audience. Avoid themes that may be perceived as exclusive or marginalizing.
3. Accessible Venue: Select a venue that is easily accessible for people with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and audio descriptions.
4. Flexible Pricing: Offer flexible pricing options to accommodate different financial means. Consider offering discounts or scholarships for marginalized groups.
5. Volunteer Opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for people of all backgrounds and abilities. This can help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity among attendees.
6. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow attendees to engage with each other and the speakers in a more informal setting. This can help break down barriers and create a more collaborative atmosphere.
7. Safe Spaces: Establish safe spaces for marginalized communities to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or discrimination.
8. Diverse Communication Channels: Use a variety of communication channels, such as live streaming, social media, and email updates, to reach a wider audience and accommodate different learning styles.
9. Inclusive Marketing: Develop marketing materials that are inclusive and representative of the diverse communities you aim to serve. Avoid language or imagery that may be offensive or marginalizing.
10. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish mechanisms for attendees to provide feedback and suggestions for future events. This can help ensure that the event is continuously improving and becoming more inclusive over time.
