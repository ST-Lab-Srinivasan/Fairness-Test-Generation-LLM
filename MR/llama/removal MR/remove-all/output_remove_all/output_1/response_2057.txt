To highlight the issues faced by "strictly partly long-term" individuals (i.e., those who are long-term unemployed or underemployed) using data, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the population: Start by defining the population you want to study. This could be people who have been unemployed for a certain number of months or years, or those who are working in low-paying jobs with limited opportunities for advancement.
2. Collect data: Gather data on the demographics, education levels, and work experience of your population. You can use existing datasets such as the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) or create your own survey to collect data.
3. Analyze the data: Use statistical analysis techniques such as regression analysis or clustering analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data. For example, you could analyze how long-term unemployment affects different demographic groups, such as young people, minorities, or those with lower levels of education.
4. Visualize the data: Use data visualization techniques such as charts, graphs, or maps to present the data in an accessible and easy-to-understand format. For example, you could create a bar chart showing the number of long-term unemployed individuals by age group or a map showing the geographic distribution of long-term unemployment across different regions.
5. Interpret the results: Analyze the findings and interpret the results in the context of the issues faced by long-term unemployed individuals. For example, you could find that young people are disproportionately represented among the long-term unemployed, which highlights the challenges they face in entering the labor market.
6. Present the findings: Share the results with relevant stakeholders, such as policymakers, employers, and community organizations, to raise awareness about the issues faced by long-term unemployed individuals. You could use reports, presentations, or infographics to present your findings in a clear and concise manner.
7. Advocate for change: Use the insights gained from the data analysis to advocate for policies and practices that support long-term unemployed individuals. For example, you could
