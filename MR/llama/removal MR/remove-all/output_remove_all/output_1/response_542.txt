Addressing the needs of Not Recently Beneficiaries (NRBs) in disaster response is crucial to ensure that these individuals, who have been displaced or affected by a disaster but are not recent beneficiaries of humanitarian aid, receive the support they need. Here are some ways to address the needs of NRBs in disaster response:

1. Assess their specific needs: Conduct thorough assessments to identify the unique needs of NRBs, including their socio-economic status, access to basic necessities, and level of vulnerability. This will help tailor responses to meet their specific needs.
2. Develop inclusive response strategies: Involve NRBs in the disaster response planning process to ensure that their perspectives and experiences are taken into account. This can involve establishing community-based organizations or participatory planning processes.
3. Focus on sustainable solutions: Rather than providing short-term fixes, focus on developing sustainable solutions that address the root causes of NRBs' vulnerability. This may involve supporting local economic development initiatives, improving access to basic services like healthcare and education, and promoting community-based disaster risk reduction strategies.
4. Build partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that have a deep understanding of the NRB context, including their cultural, social, and economic dynamics. This can help ensure that responses are culturally appropriate and effective in addressing the needs of NRBs.
5. Provide targeted support: Develop targeted interventions that address the specific needs of NRBs, such as livelihood support, shelter materials, or health services. Ensure that these interventions are designed with the active participation of NRBs themselves.
6. Address social exclusion: Acknowledge the historical and systemic factors that have led to NRBs' marginalization and exclusion, and work towards addressing these issues in disaster response efforts. This can involve promoting inclusive governance structures and advocating for policies that promote equitable access to resources and services.
7. Foster community resilience: Support the development of community-based disaster risk reduction strategies that prioritize the participation of NRBs. This can involve capacity-building activities, such as training on disaster
