Addressing the needs of Non-Newly Non-Individuals (NNIs) in disaster response is crucial to ensure that all members of society are included and supported during emergencies. NNIs may include people with disabilities, older adults, children, and other vulnerable populations who require specific attention and accommodations during disaster response efforts. Here are some ways to address the needs of NNIs in disaster response:

1. Inclusive Planning and Response: Ensure that disaster response plans include provisions for NNIs and that their needs are taken into account during planning and response efforts. This may involve consulting with organizations that represent NNIs, such as disability rights groups or advocacy organizations.
2. Accessibility and Accommodations: Ensure that emergency shelters and evacuation routes are accessible to NNIs, including those with mobility impairments. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair-accessible transportation, sign language interpreters, and assistive technology.
3. Trained Volunteers and Staff: Ensure that volunteers and staff working in disaster response efforts are trained to interact with NNIs in a respectful and supportive manner. This may involve providing training on disability awareness and cultural competency.
4. Communication Accessibility: Ensure that communication during disaster response efforts is accessible to NNIs, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters, written materials in Braille, and other forms of communication that meet the needs of NNIs.
5. Inclusive Feeding and Hydration: Ensure that feeding and hydration efforts during disaster response are inclusive of NNIs' dietary needs, including those with food allergies or sensitivities. Provide a variety of food options that meet the nutritional needs of individuals with disabilities.
6. Mental Health Support: Provide mental health support services that are tailored to the unique needs of NNIs during disaster response efforts. This may involve working with organizations that specialize in serving NNIs, such as mental health clinics or advocacy groups.
7. Inclusive Participation: Ensure that NNIs are included in disaster response
