1. Limited access to health facilities: Many rural areas in Nigeria lack access to basic health infrastructure, such as hospitals and clinics, making it difficult for people living in these areas to receive proper medical care.
2. High cost of healthcare: The cost of healthcare services in Nigeria can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for those living in rural areas or those with low incomes. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems.
3. Shortage of skilled healthworkers: Nigeria faces a shortage of trained and experienced healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas. This can lead to inadequate care and delays in receiving medical attention.
