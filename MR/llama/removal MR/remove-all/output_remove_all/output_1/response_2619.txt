Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-term beginner speakers of a second language. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence the language learning process and identity formation:

1. Cultural values and beliefs: Long-term beginners may bring their cultural values and beliefs to their language learning, which can affect their motivation, attitudes, and behaviors towards language acquisition. For example, some cultures place a high value on respect for elders or authority figures, while others prioritize individualism and self-expression.
