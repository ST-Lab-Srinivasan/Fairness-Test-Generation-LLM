Creating more inclusive social policies for strongly mid-50s individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this age group. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society for this demographic:

To address this, we need to challenge ageist attitudes and behaviors and promote age-friendly environments that value and respect the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their age.
