Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently beginner speakers, particularly those who are learning a second language. Cultural heritage refers to the shared knowledge, beliefs, values, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a cultural group. When individuals begin to learn a new language, they are not only learning a new set of linguistic rules but also immersing themselves in a new culture.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of recently beginner speakers:

1. Cultural values and beliefs: The cultural values and beliefs of the language being learned can influence how individuals perceive themselves and their place within their community. For example, if a person is learning a language that places a strong emphasis on collectivism, they may feel more connected to their community and culture than if they were learning a language that emphasizes individualism.
2. Customs and practices: Cultural customs and practices can also shape the identities of recently beginner speakers. For example, if a person is learning a language that has a strong tradition of oral storytelling, they may feel more connected to their cultural heritage than if they were learning a language that places less emphasis on oral communication.
3. Language and identity: The relationship between language and identity is complex, and cultural heritage can play a significant role in shaping how individuals perceive themselves through the language they speak. For example, if a person is learning a language that is closely tied to their cultural heritage, they may feel more connected to their identity than if they were learning a language that is less tied to their cultural background.
4. Intersectionality: It's important to recognize that cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, and class. For example, a person who is learning a language that is closely tied to their cultural heritage may also experience intersectional identities, such as being a woman of color learning a language that is predominantly spoken by men.
5. Power dynamics: The power dynamics of cultural heritage can also shape the identities of recently beginner speakers. For example, if a person is learning a language that has historically been oppressed or marginalized, they may feel more connected to their cultural heritage than if they were learning a language
