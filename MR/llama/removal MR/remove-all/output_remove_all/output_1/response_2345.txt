I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to support the civic engagement of "natural-born US non-people." This term is not a recognized legal or political concept in the United States, and it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or immigration status, are entitled to full citizenship rights and protections under the US Constitution.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the civic engagement of all eligible voters in the United States, including those who may be non-citizens or have a complex immigration status. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize events or campaigns to register eligible voters, particularly in communities with low voter turnout.
2. Voter education: Provide information and resources on the voting process, candidates, and issues to help individuals make informed decisions at the polls.
3. Get-out-the-vote efforts: Encourage eligible voters to exercise their right to vote by providing transportation, childcare, or other support services.
4. Civic engagement opportunities: Offer opportunities for individuals to participate in civic activities, such as volunteering, advocacy, or community organizing.
5. Language accessibility: Provide language interpretation and translation services at polling stations or during voter registration drives to ensure that all eligible voters can participate.
6. Disability accessibility: Ensure that polling stations are accessible for individuals with disabilities and provide accommodations such as accessible voting machines or audio ballots.
7. Building trust: Work to build trust within communities by providing accurate information, being transparent about voting processes, and avoiding partisanship or bias.
8. Community outreach: Engage with diverse communities through culturally sensitive messaging and outreach strategies to increase voter participation.
9. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that work with immigrant or marginalized communities to promote civic engagement and voting.
10. Advocacy: Advocate for policies that support civic engagement, such as automatic voter registration, same-day registration, or online registration.

Remember, it's important
