7. Lack of culturally appropriate care: Mixed-heritage individuals may require culturally appropriate care that takes into account their specific needs and experiences. However, this care may not be readily available or accessible.
8. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Mixed-heritage individuals may face challenges navigating the complex healthcare system, particularly if they do not identify with a single racial or ethnic group.
9. Lack of trust: Mixed-heritage individuals may have difficulty building trust with healthcare providers due to historical trauma and ongoing discrimination.
