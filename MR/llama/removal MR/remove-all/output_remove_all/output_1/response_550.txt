Addressing the needs of not recently non-individuals in disaster response requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that considers the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by these groups. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Policies: Governments and organizations should develop DRRM policies that recognize the diversity of communities and incorporate the perspectives of not recently non-individuals. This can involve engaging with local organizations and community leaders to ensure that their needs are addressed.
2. Accessibility and Inclusive Evacuation Plans: Evacuation plans should be designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision, or have mobility impairments. This can involve providing accessible transportation, clear signage, and trained evacuees to assist in evacuation processes.
3. Shelter and Accommodation: In the aftermath of a disaster, it is essential to provide safe and accessible shelter for all individuals, including those who are not recently non-individuals. This can involve working with local organizations to identify accessible housing options or providing temporary shelters that are equipped with assistive technologies.
4. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and inclusive of not recently non-individuals. This can involve providing sign language interpretation, braille materials, and other accommodations to ensure that everyone has access to medical care.
5. Inclusive Information Dissemination: Provide information in a variety of formats to reach different communities, including those who are not recently non-individuals. This can involve using multiple languages, sign language interpretation, and braille materials.
6. Community-Led Response: Support community-led response efforts that prioritize the needs of not recently non-individuals. This can involve working with local organizations to identify their specific needs and developing strategies to address them.
7. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for not recently non-individuals to develop skills and knowledge in disaster response and management. This can involve providing training on accessible emergency planning, evacuation procedures, and first aid.
