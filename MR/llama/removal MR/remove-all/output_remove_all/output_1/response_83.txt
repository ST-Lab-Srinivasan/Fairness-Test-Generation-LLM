Ensuring that the voices of beginner speaker mixed-heritage individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to create an inclusive and equitable environment. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space: Beginner speakers may feel hesitant or uncomfortable sharing their thoughts, especially if they are from diverse backgrounds. Creating a safe space where everyone feels valued and respected can help them feel more comfortable expressing themselves.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that can be alienating or marginalizing. Instead, use inclusive language that acknowledges the diversity of voices in the room. For example, instead of saying "the team," say "all of us."
3. Encourage participation: Make sure everyone has a chance to participate in discussions and decision-making processes. Use techniques like "round-robin" or "go-around" to give each person a turn to speak without interrupting or dominating the conversation.
4. Provide support: Offer support and resources to help beginner speakers build their confidence and skills in speaking up. This can include training sessions, mentorship programs, or simply offering encouragement and recognition for their contributions.
5. Listen actively: When beginner speakers do share their thoughts, make sure to listen actively and attentively. Avoid interrupting or dismissing their ideas, and instead, show appreciation and interest in their perspectives.
6. Address power dynamics: Beginner speakers may face barriers due to systemic power imbalances. Be aware of these dynamics and take steps to address them, such as giving everyone an equal voice in decision-making processes or using techniques like "consensus decision-making."
7. Create opportunities for representation: Ensure that beginner speakers have a platform to share their voices and perspectives. This can be done by creating opportunities for representation, such as through leadership roles, advocacy groups, or community projects.
8. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity within the decision-making process. This can involve setting clear expectations and guidelines for respectful communication, providing training on inclusive language and behaviors, and holding everyone accountable for upholding these standards.
