Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare specifically for actively or recently naturalized people:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they build trust and rapport with their patients, particularly those who may have had negative experiences with the healthcare system in the past. Actively or recently naturalized individuals are more likely to feel comfortable sharing their concerns and needs when they perceive that their provider understands and respects their cultural background.
2.

For example, immigrants may have different expectations about healthcare based on their cultural beliefs and practices, which can affect their adherence to treatment plans.

4. Enhanced communication: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can communicate more effectively with actively or recently naturalized patients, taking into account their language proficiency, literacy level, and cultural norms around communication.
