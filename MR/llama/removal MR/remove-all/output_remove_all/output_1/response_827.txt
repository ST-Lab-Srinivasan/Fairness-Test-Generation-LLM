Creating more inclusive social policies for multiple time individuals requires understanding and addressing the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Recognize and acknowledge the existence of multiple timers: The first step is to recognize that multiple timers exist and acknowledge their experiences. This involves educating policymakers, the public, and other stakeholders about the challenges faced by this group.
2. Collect data on multiple timing populations: Gathering data on the number of individuals who experience time dilation or other forms of temporal displacement can help policymakers understand the scope of the issue and identify areas where policies need to be tailored.
3. Develop targeted interventions: Policymakers should develop interventions that address the specific needs of multiple timers. For example, providing resources for time management training, flexible work arrangements, or mental health support can help individuals cope with the challenges of living in a non-linear time.
4. Address systemic barriers: Policymakers should identify and address systemic barriers that prevent multiple timers from fully participating in society. For example, providing accommodations for individuals who experience time dilation in the workplace or educational settings can help level the playing field.
5. Promote awareness and understanding: Efforts to promote awareness and understanding of the experiences of multiple timers can help reduce stigma and discrimination. This can involve educating the public about the challenges faced by this group and promoting empathy and inclusivity.
6. Advocate for policy changes: Multiple timers often face significant barriers in accessing services, benefits, and opportunities due to their temporal status. Policymakers should advocate for policy changes that address these disparities and provide equal access to resources and opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their temporal status.
7. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Creating a culture of inclusivity can help promote a more equitable society where multiple timers are valued and respected. This involves promoting empathy, understanding, and acceptance of diverse temporal experiences and challenges.
8. Provide support for mental health and well-being: Multiple timers often face unique mental health challenges due to their non-linear experience
