Supporting the mental health of individuals who identify as "cisgender not for a long time" (or those who may be questioning their gender identity) is crucial for their overall well-being and self-esteem. Here are some ways to support these individuals:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Allow them to express themselves without judgment or criticism. Listen actively, and validate their emotions, providing a safe space for them to open up.
2. Educate yourself: Learn about the LGBTQ+ community, including the experiences of those who identify as cisgender not for a long time. This will help you better understand their struggles and provide informed support.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using binary gender language (i.e., "guys," "boys," etc.) and instead use gender-neutral terms or ask how someone prefers to be referred to.
4. Be mindful of your privilege: Recognize that you may have unconscious biases or advantages based on your gender identity, and work to overcome these by listening to the experiences of those who are not cisgender.
5. Encourage self-care: Support them in practicing self-care activities that promote mental wellness, such as meditation, exercise, or creative pursuits.
6. Connect them with resources: Introduce them to LGBTQ+ organizations and support groups, where they can find a sense of community and connection with others who share similar experiences.
7. Be patient and understanding: Remember that gender identity is a complex and ongoing process, and be patient with their journey. Avoid putting pressure on them to conform to societal expectations or to "figure things out."
8. Respect their privacy: Respect their privacy and avoid sharing their personal information without their consent. This includes not outing them to others without their permission.
9. Offer support during difficult times: Be there for them during challenging times, such as when they are experiencing discrimination or harassment based on their gender identity.
10. Celebrate their identity: Acknowledge and celebrate their identity, whether it be through small gestures like using their preferred pronouns or through larger actions like advocating for LGBTQ+ rights.
