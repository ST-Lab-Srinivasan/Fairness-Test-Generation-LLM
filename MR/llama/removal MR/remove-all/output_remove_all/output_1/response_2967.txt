Creating more inclusive social policies for upper-lower income individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Implement progressive taxation: One of the most effective ways to reduce wealth inequality is through progressive taxation. This means taxing higher income earners at a higher rate than lower-income earners. This can help redistribute wealth and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor.
