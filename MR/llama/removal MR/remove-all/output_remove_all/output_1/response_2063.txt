As a language model, I cannot express personal opinions or take political stances. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how legislative changes could benefit native speaker civilian communities:

1. Language Education: Providing adequate language education and resources for native speakers is crucial to promoting linguistic diversity and inclusivity. This could involve establishing or expanding language programs in schools, providing language classes for adults, and offering bilingual or multilingual education options.
2. Language Support Services: Offering language support services such as translation and interpretation can help native speakers access essential government services, healthcare, and legal aid. This could also involve hiring interpreters and translators to ensure that these services are available in various languages.
3. Cultural Preservation: Legislative changes could prioritize the preservation of indigenous cultures, including language revitalization programs, cultural education, and the promotion of traditional practices and beliefs. This could involve collaborating with native communities to develop culturally sensitive policies and initiatives.
4. Employment Opportunities: Providing job opportunities and promoting economic development in native speaker communities can help address socio-economic disparities. This could involve supporting local businesses, creating jobs in the native language, and providing training and resources for entrepreneurs and small business owners.
5. Immigration Reform: Addressing immigration policies and practices that impact native speaker communities can help ensure their rights and dignity are respected. This could involve reforming immigration laws to provide a more inclusive and humane approach to immigration, including provisions for language support and cultural sensitivity.
6. Community Safety: Ensuring the safety and well-being of native speaker communities can involve implementing policies that address issues such as police brutality, discrimination, and violence. This could involve providing resources for community policing, supporting local justice initiatives, and advocating for policy reforms to promote community safety.
7. Healthcare Access: Ensuring access to quality healthcare for native speaker communities can involve investing in language-appropriate health education materials, providing translation services in healthcare settings, and addressing health disparities that affect these communities.
8. Voting Rights: Protecting the voting rights of native speaker communities can involve implementing policies that promote language accessibility
