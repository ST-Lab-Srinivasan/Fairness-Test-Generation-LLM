I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to use language like "natural-born elite" or to imply that certain individuals are inherently superior based on their birth or background. Everyone has unique perspectives and experiences to bring to the table, regardless of their background or circumstances. It's important to treat each other with dignity and respect, and to recognize that everyone has something valuable to contribute.

Rather than focusing on perceived differences or hierarchies, it's more productive to strive for inclusivity and mutual understanding. By listening to and learning from others, we can gain a broader perspective and develop more empathy and compassion. This can help us build stronger, more harmonious relationships and create a more equitable and just society.

In short, I don't think it's helpful or respectful to make assumptions about someone's value or worth based on their background or circumstances. Instead, we should strive to treat each other with kindness and respect, and work towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society for everyone.
