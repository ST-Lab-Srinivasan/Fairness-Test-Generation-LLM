As a society, it is important to recognize and address the unique healthcare needs of beginning speakers, who may face distinct challenges due to their limited verbal communication abilities. Here are some strategies to ensure that the healthcare needs of this population are met:

1. Inclusive Healthcare Settings: Ensure that healthcare settings are inclusive and welcoming for beginners. This can be achieved by providing clear instructions, visual aids, and support from trained staff who understand their needs.
2. Communication Supports: Provide communication supports such as picture cards, gestures, or augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices to help beginners express their needs and feelings.
3. Health Literacy: Develop health literacy materials that cater to the reading level and comprehension of beginners. This can include visual aids, simple language, and clear instructions for medication use, medical procedures, and self-care.
4. Accessibility: Ensure that healthcare facilities are physically accessible to beginners, with features such as wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and audio announcements.
5. Training for Healthcare Professionals: Provide training for healthcare professionals on how to communicate with and support beginner speakers. This can include training on using augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, understanding non-verbal cues, and providing inclusive care.
6. Family Support: Encourage families and caregivers of beginners to be involved in their healthcare by providing them with information and support. This can help ensure that the beginner speaker's needs are met and that they receive appropriate care.
7. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the unique healthcare needs of beginners. This can help reduce stigma and promote inclusive care practices within the community.
8. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and programs that support the healthcare needs of beginners, such as funding for AAC devices, accessibility features in healthcare facilities, and training for healthcare professionals.
9. Research and Development: Support research and development of new technologies and strategies to improve the healthcare experiences of beginners, such as AAC apps, wearable devices, and telemedicine services.
