As a traditionalist, you may face several challenges in the job market as a beginner speaker. Here are some of them:

1. Limited exposure to public speaking: Traditionalists may not have had as much practice or experience with public speaking as their younger counterparts, which can make it more difficult for them to feel comfortable and confident when speaking in front of an audience.
2. Outdated communication styles: Traditionalists may be used to communication styles that are no longer effective in today's fast-paced, technology-driven world. For example, they may rely too heavily on written documents or be unfamiliar with digital tools and platforms.
3. Resistance to change: Traditionalists may be resistant to new ideas or approaches, which can make it challenging for them to adapt to the constantly evolving job market.
4. Limited networking opportunities: Traditionalists may have a smaller network of contacts than younger generations, which can limit their access to job opportunities and professional development.
5. Perception of being out of touch: Traditionalists may be perceived as out of touch with current trends and technologies, which can make it harder for them to find employment or advance in their careers.
6. Lack of flexibility: Traditionalists may have a more rigid approach to work and life, which can make it difficult for them to adapt to changing circumstances or take on new challenges.
7. Limited access to training and development: Traditionalists may have fewer opportunities for training and professional development than younger generations, which can limit their ability to learn new skills and stay competitive in the job market.
8. Stereotypes and bias: Unfortunately, traditionalists may face stereotypes and bias based on their age or generation, which can impact their job prospects and opportunities for advancement.
9. Limited access to mentorship: Traditionalists may have fewer opportunities for mentorship and guidance from experienced professionals, which can limit their ability to learn from others and navigate the job market.
10. Challenges in finding a flexible work arrangement: Traditionalists may have difficulty finding flexible work arrangements that accommodate their preferences or needs, such as part-time or remote work.

It's important to note that these challenges can vary depending on individual circumstances
