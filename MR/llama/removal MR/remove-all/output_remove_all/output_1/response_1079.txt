Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, who are beginners in terms of public speaking, may not be well understood. In this research, we aim to investigate the effects of marital status on the lives of these individuals during this critical period.

Theory:
Marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and a sense of security. On the other hand, it can also lead to increased stress, responsibility, and social isolation. The effects of marital status on individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy may be more pronounced due to the physical and emotional changes they are experiencing during this period.

Methods:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of 100 pregnant women in their third trimester, with questions assessing their marital status, stress levels, emotional wellbeing, and social support. Additionally, 20 of these participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gather more detailed information on the impact of marital status on their lives during this period.

Results:
Our survey results indicate that married women in their third trimester of pregnancy report lower levels of stress and higher levels of emotional wellbeing compared to unmarried women. In contrast, unmarried women reported feeling more socially isolated and experiencing greater difficulty in adjusting to the physical changes associated with pregnancy. The qualitative interviews further revealed that married women were better able to cope with the challenges of pregnancy due to their emotional support network, while unmarried women struggled to find adequate emotional support.

Conclusion:
Our findings suggest that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy. Married women reported lower levels of stress and higher levels of emotional wellbeing, while unmarried women experienced greater social isolation and difficulty adjusting to the physical changes associated with pregnancy. These results highlight the importance
