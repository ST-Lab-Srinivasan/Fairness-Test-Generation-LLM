The impact of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Carriers of genetic conditions may face social isolation, as they may feel ashamed or embarrassed about their condition. This can lead to difficulties forming and maintaining relationships, particularly romantic relationships.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Carriers of genetic conditions may experience stigma and discrimination from family, friends, and society at large. This can lead to feelings of low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety.
3. Limited access to education and employment: In Mexico, carriers of genetic conditions may face limited access to education and employment opportunities due to societal attitudes and discrimination. This can limit their future prospects and earning potential.
4. Financial difficulties: Carriers of genetic conditions may experience financial difficulties due to increased healthcare costs, reduced productivity, and limited income. This can lead to poverty and social exclusion.
5. Limited access to healthcare: Carriers of genetic conditions may face limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural or marginalized communities. This can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, exacerbating the condition and reducing quality of life.
6. Emotional burden: Carriers of genetic conditions may experience an emotional burden due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of their condition. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
7. Limited participation in social activities: Carriers of genetic conditions may face limitations in participating in social activities, such as recreational sports or clubs, due to the impact of their condition on their physical abilities.
8. Difficulty with daily living activities: Carriers of genetic conditions may experience difficulty with daily living activities, such as bathing, dressing, and grooming, due to the impact of their condition on their mobility and dexterity.
9. Impact on family dynamics: Carriers of genetic conditions may experience tension within their families due to the emotional burden placed on family members, particularly caregivers.
10. Limited access to psychosocial support
