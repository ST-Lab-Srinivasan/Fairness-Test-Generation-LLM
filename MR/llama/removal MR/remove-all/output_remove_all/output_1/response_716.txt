Creating more inclusive community programs for physically able-bodied older adults (ages 90 and up) requires careful consideration of their unique needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help create more age-friendly and inclusive community programs:

1. Conduct a needs assessment: Engage with the older adult population to understand their interests, preferences, and barriers to participation in community programs. This will help identify areas of focus for program development.
2. Involve intergenerational partnerships: Collaborate with younger generations to create programs that are co-designed and co-delivered by people of different ages. This fosters mutual learning, respect, and a sense of community.
3. Provide accessible facilities and transportation: Ensure that program locations are wheelchair accessible and offer transportation options for those who cannot drive or use public transportation.
4. Offer a variety of activities: Develop programs that cater to diverse interests and abilities, such as art classes, music performances, gardening clubs, or sports teams. This will help older adults stay engaged and active in their communities.
5. Foster social connections: Create opportunities for older adults to connect with others through events, gatherings, or group outings. Social isolation can have negative effects on mental health, so it's essential to encourage social interaction.
6. Provide support for caregivers: Offer resources and respite for family members and caregivers who may be caring for older adults. This can include educational workshops, emotional support groups, or professional counseling services.
7. Promote intergenerational learning: Develop programs that facilitate knowledge sharing between generations, such as mentorship opportunities or cross-age tutoring. This can help build connections and foster mutual respect.
8. Encourage community involvement: Organize events that bring together older adults with the broader community, such as volunteer opportunities, cultural festivals, or civic engagement activities.
9. Provide technology training: Offer computer classes or digital literacy workshops to help older adults stay connected and engaged with their communities through technology.
10. Evaluate and improve programs regularly: Regularly assess the effectiveness of community programs
