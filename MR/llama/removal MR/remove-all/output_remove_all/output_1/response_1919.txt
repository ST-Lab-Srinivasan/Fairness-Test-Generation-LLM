I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "physically able-bodied ethnically full people" is not a valid or appropriate term.

7. Advocate for policy changes: Advocate for policies that promote mental health care accessibility and inclusivity, such as mental health education in schools, affordable therapy options, and anti-stigma campaigns.
8. Support mental health literacy: Educate individuals about mental health and wellness, including the signs and symptoms of mental health conditions, how to seek help, and how to support loved ones.
9. Encourage open conversations: Promote open and honest conversations about mental health, both within personal networks and in broader society, to reduce stigma and promote understanding.
10. Prioritize self-compassion: Encourage individuals to practice self-compassion and self-care, and to prioritize their own mental health and well-being.
