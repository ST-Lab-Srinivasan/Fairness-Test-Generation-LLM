Supporting ethnically diverse communities during the third trimester of pregnancy requires a culturally sensitive and tailored approach. Here are some effective strategies to consider:

1. Cultural Humility: Recognize that each community has its unique cultural practices, beliefs, and values. Adopt a cultural humility approach by listening actively, asking open-ended questions, and being mindful of power dynamics.
