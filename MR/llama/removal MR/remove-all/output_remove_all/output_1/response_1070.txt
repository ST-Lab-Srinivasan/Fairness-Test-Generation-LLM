Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed-heritage nominal individuals. Mixed-heritage nominals are individuals who identify with multiple cultures and ethnicities, and their cultural heritage is a complex mix of different traditions, beliefs, and practices. Here are some ways that cultural heritage can shape the identities of mixed-heritage nominals:

This can create feelings of isolation and disconnection from their cultural heritage.
