Native American natural-born US citizens face a number of challenges within the US healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities and specialized care. This can result in delayed or lack of access to necessary medical treatment, particularly for chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues.
2. Cultural barriers: The US healthcare system can be challenging for Native Americans due to cultural differences and a lack of understanding of traditional healing practices and beliefs. Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the unique needs and practices of Native American communities, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
3. Language barriers: Many Native American communities have their own distinct languages and dialects, which can create a language barrier for healthcare providers who are not fluent in these languages. This can make it difficult for patients to communicate their symptoms and concerns, and can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
4. Discrimination: Native Americans have historically faced discrimination within the US healthcare system, including being subjected to inappropriate or unnecessary medical procedures, such as vasectomies without consent, and being denied access to necessary care based on their race or ethnicity. These experiences of discrimination can lead to mistrust of the healthcare system and difficulty accessing care.
5. Limited availability of culturally competent providers: Many Native American communities lack access to healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to traditional healing practices and cultural beliefs. This can result in a lack of culturally competent care, which can exacerbate health disparities.
6. Limited availability of specialized care: Many Native American communities have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiology, oncology, or pediatrics. This can result in delayed or lack of access to necessary medical treatment, particularly for chronic conditions.
7. High rates of diabetes and other chronic conditions: Native Americans are disproportionately affected by diabetes and other chronic conditions, such as heart disease and respiratory diseases. This can lead to higher healthcare utilization and costs, particularly in rural areas with limited access to specialized care
