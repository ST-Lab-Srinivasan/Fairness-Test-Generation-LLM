7. Stereotyping and bias: Traditionalists may face stereotypes and biases based on their age, culture, or other factors, which can limit their potential for success in the workplace.
8. Lack of mentorship and support: Traditionalists may find it difficult to access mentorship and support from their employers, particularly if they are working in industries that are not traditionally associated with mentorship and support.
9. Limited networking opportunities: Traditionalists may find it difficult to network and build connections in their industries due to a lack of opportunities or support from their employers.
