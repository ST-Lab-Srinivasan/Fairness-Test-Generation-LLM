To use data to highlight the issues faced by strictly party-goers, lifelong learners, and recently retired individuals, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the population: Start by identifying the population you want to analyze. In this case, let's consider individuals who fall into one of the three categories mentioned in the prompt: strictly party-goers, lifelong learners, and recently retired.
2. Gather data: Collect data on various factors that affect these groups, such as their lifestyle habits, interests, income levels, education levels, and more. You can use surveys, questionnaires, or existing datasets to gather this information.
3. Analyze the data: Once you have collected the data, analyze it to identify patterns and trends among these groups. Look for differences in their behavior, attitudes, and preferences. For example, you might find that strictly party-goers are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as excessive drinking or drug use, while lifelong learners are more likely to prioritize education and personal growth.
4. Visualize the data: Use visualization techniques such as charts, graphs, and heat maps to present the data in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. This will help your audience quickly grasp the key findings and insights.
5. Highlight the issues: Based on your analysis and visualization of the data, highlight the specific issues faced by each group. For example, you might find that strictly party-goers are more likely to experience mental health problems due to their lifestyle choices, while lifelong learners may struggle with balancing work and personal life.
6. Provide recommendations: Offer practical recommendations for how individuals in each group can address the issues they face. For example, you might suggest that strictly party-goers prioritize self-care and seek support from friends and family, while lifelong learners may benefit from setting boundaries around work and personal life to maintain a healthy balance.
7. Share your findings: Present your analysis and recommendations in a clear and concise manner, using infographics, reports, or presentations. Share your findings with relevant stakeholders, such as policymakers, community leaders, or organizations that support these groups.
