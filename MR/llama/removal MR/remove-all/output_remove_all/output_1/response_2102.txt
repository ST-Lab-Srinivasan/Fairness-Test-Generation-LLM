To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner speakers who are recent immigrants to the US, you could consider the following steps:

1. Collect data: Gather data on the language proficiency levels of beginner speakers, their country of origin, and their socio-demographic characteristics. You could use surveys, interviews, or existing datasets.
2. Analyze the data: Examine the data to identify trends and patterns among beginner speakers. For example, you might find that beginner speakers from certain countries have lower language proficiency levels than others, or that female beginners face more challenges than male beginners.
3. Create visualizations: Use statistical visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, or scatter plots to present the data in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. For example, you could create a bar chart showing the distribution of language proficiency levels among beginner speakers by country of origin.
4. Write a report: Compile your findings into a comprehensive report that highlights the issues faced by beginner speakers. Include recommendations for addressing these issues and improving language learning outcomes for this population.
5. Share the findings: Present your report to relevant stakeholders, such as language instructors, administrators, or policymakers. You could also share your findings through blog posts, social media, or academic conferences.
6. Use storytelling: Instead of presenting dry data, use narratives and anecdotes to bring the issues faced by beginner speakers to life. For example, you could share a story about a recent immigrant who struggled to find employment due to their language proficiency level.
7. Create interactive tools: Develop interactive tools such as quizzes, games, or virtual reality experiences that allow users to explore the data and learn more about the issues faced by beginner speakers.
8. Use infographics: Create eye-catching infographics that present complex data in a simple and visually appealing way. For example, you could create an infographic showing the most common language barriers faced by beginner speakers and how they can be overcome.
9. Leverage multimedia: Incorporate audio and video elements into your presentation to provide a more engaging and immersive
