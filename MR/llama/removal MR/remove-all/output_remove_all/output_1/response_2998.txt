Advocacy for the rights of Nigerians who have been marginalized, oppressed, or excluded from power and resources is crucial for promoting social justice and equality in the country. Here are some examples of successful advocacy efforts for Nigerian long-time rights:

1. #BringBackOurGirls: In 2014, the Boko Haram terrorist group kidnapped over 270 girls from a school in Chibok, Borno State. The #BringBackOurGirls campaign, led by Nigerian women and supported by international activists, raised awareness about the abduction and advocated for the girls' safe return. While not all of the girls were recovered, the campaign highlighted the importance of protecting children's rights and education in Nigeria.
2. Niger Delta Clean-up: The Niger Delta region has been plagued by environmental degradation and pollution due to oil exploitation. The "Clean Up Niger Delta" campaign, launched in 2015, brought together civil society groups, community leaders, and government agencies to demand a comprehensive clean-up of the region's waterways and land. While progress has been slow, the campaign has helped raise awareness about the environmental impact of oil extraction and the need for sustainable development in Nigeria.
3. Ending Child Marriage: Nigeria has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. The "Girls Not Brides" campaign, launched in 2011, aims to end child marriage by 2030. Through advocacy and community engagement, the campaign has helped raise awareness about the negative impacts of child marriage and secured policy commitments from state governments to adopt laws that protect girls' rights.
4. #SexForGrades: In 2019, a documentary exposed the widespread practice of sexual harassment and exploitation of female students by lecturers in Nigerian universities. The #SexForGrades campaign, launched in response, highlighted the need for accountability and reform within Nigeria's higher education institutions. While progress has been slow, the campaign has helped raise awareness about the prevalence of sexual harassment in Niger
