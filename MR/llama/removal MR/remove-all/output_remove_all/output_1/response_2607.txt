Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong learners, particularly for individuals who are recent beginners. Cultural heritage refers to the shared knowledge, beliefs, values, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society. It includes the history, language, religion, arts, and other cultural expressions of a community.

For lifelong learners who are recent beginners, cultural heritage can serve as a source of inspiration, motivation, and guidance in their language learning journey. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of these individuals:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. When learners engage with the cultural expressions of their target language, they feel more connected to the language and its speakers. This sense of belonging can motivate them to continue learning and using the language.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage shapes individuals' identities by providing a framework for understanding who they are and where they come from. When learners engage with their target language's cultural heritage, they can better understand themselves in relation to the larger cultural context. This can help them form a stronger sense of identity as language learners.
3. Emotional connection: Cultural heritage can evoke strong emotions and connections to a particular group or community. When learners engage with the cultural expressions of their target language, they may feel a deeper emotional connection to the language and its speakers. This emotional connection can motivate them to continue learning and using the language.
4. Authenticity: Cultural heritage provides authentic contexts for language use. When learners engage with their target language's cultural heritage, they can practice the language in a more authentic way, as they are exposed to real-life situations and experiences. This can help them develop a more nuanced understanding of the language and its culture.
5. Respect and appreciation: Cultural heritage teaches learners respect and appreciation for the cultural practices and traditions of the target language community. When learners engage with their target language's cultural heritage, they can develop a deeper appreciation for the language and its speakers, which can enhance their motivation to continue learning and
