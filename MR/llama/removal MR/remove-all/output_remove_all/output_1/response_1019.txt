As a beginner speaker, there are several challenges that monastic people may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of knowledge and understanding: Monastic people may not be familiar with the legal terminology and procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Monastic people may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or online legal databases, which can limit their ability to research and understand the law.
3. Language barriers: For monastic people who do not speak the dominant language of the country they are living in, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging.
4. Cultural differences: Monastic people may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can sometimes conflict with the legal system.
5. Limited financial resources: Monastic people may not have access to the financial resources needed to hire a lawyer or pay for legal services, which can limit their ability to advocate for themselves in the legal system.
6. Lack of representation: Monastic people may not have a voice or representation in the legal system, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights and interests.
7. Discrimination: Monastic people may face discrimination in the legal system due to their religious beliefs or practices.
8. Limited access to justice: Monastic people may have limited access to justice due to factors such as language barriers, cultural differences, and financial resources.
9. Lack of trust: Monastic people may not trust the legal system or lawyers, which can make it difficult for them to seek legal advice or representation.
10. Stigma: Monastic people may face stigma or discrimination from society or the legal system due to their religious beliefs or practices, which can affect their ability to access justice.

It's important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the country and region, and monastic people may face different challenges in different contexts. However, by understanding these challenges, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and accessible legal system for all.
