I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic-based discrimination. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Supporting the civic engagement of any group of people should not be based on their ethnicity, but rather on their individual rights and freedoms.

Instead of focusing on extreme hardcore ethnically full people, it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. Here are some ways to support civic engagement in a more inclusive manner:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about different cultures, histories, and experiences of marginalized communities. This will help you understand their challenges and issues, and provide better support.
2. Listen actively: Listen to the concerns and ideas of marginalized communities, and provide a platform for them to voice their opinions.
3. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity: Work towards creating policies and practices that promote inclusivity and address systemic barriers faced by marginalized communities.
4. Support community-led initiatives: Support initiatives led by marginalized communities, such as advocacy groups, community organizations, and social enterprises.
5. Use your privilege: If you have social, economic, or cultural privileges, use them to amplify the voices of marginalized communities and support their causes.
6. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful dialogue with individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives, and listen to their experiences and views.
7. Challenge systemic barriers: Challenge systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from participating in civic engagement, such as voter suppression laws, language barriers, and lack of access to education.
8. Support voting rights: Support efforts to protect and expand voting rights for marginalized communities, including measures to combat voter suppression and increase voter turnout.
9. Encourage civic participation: Encourage individuals from marginalized communities to participate in civic engagement activities, such as voting, volunteering, and advocacy.
