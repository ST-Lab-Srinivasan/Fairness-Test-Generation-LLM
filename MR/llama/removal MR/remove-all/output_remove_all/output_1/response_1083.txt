Introduction:
Hello everyone, and thank you for joining me today to discuss the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant beginner speakers. As a soon-to-be mother myself, I understand the unique challenges that come with this stage of life, especially when it comes to navigating the public eye as a speaker.
