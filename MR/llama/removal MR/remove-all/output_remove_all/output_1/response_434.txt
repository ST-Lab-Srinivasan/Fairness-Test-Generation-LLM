Creating inclusive community events for beginner speakers can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that event organizers and hosts can use to make the event more welcoming and accessible to all participants. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify and address barriers: Beginner speakers may face various barriers such as lack of confidence, language barriers, or unfamiliarity with the topic. Identify these barriers and take steps to address them. For example, provide resources and support to help build confidence, offer language interpretation services, or provide clear guidelines and instructions for the event.
2. Set clear expectations: Clearly communicate the event's purpose, format, and expectations to all participants. This can help reduce anxiety and ensure that everyone knows what to expect. Provide detailed information about the event, including the agenda, format, and any specific rules or guidelines.
3. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Ensure that the event is free from discrimination, harassment, or other forms of exclusion. Promote a culture of respect, empathy, and inclusivity among all participants. Encourage diverse perspectives and opinions, and create opportunities for open communication and collaboration.
4. Offer support and resources: Provide resources and support to help beginner speakers prepare for the event. This can include workshops, coaching sessions, or other forms of support. Ensure that these resources are accessible and tailored to the needs of each participant.
5. Encourage participation: Make sure that all participants feel comfortable and encouraged to contribute during the event. Use icebreaker activities or other interactive methods to help participants get to know each other and build connections. Provide opportunities for questions, feedback, and constructive criticism.
6. Provide feedback and support: Offer constructive feedback and support to beginner speakers after the event. This can help them identify areas of improvement and develop their skills further. Encourage participants to share their experiences and insights with each other, and provide opportunities for ongoing learning and growth.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace and celebrate the diversity of participants, including their backgrounds, perspectives, and communication styles. Use this diversity as a strength to create a more inclusive and engaging event
