I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "Mexican soft people" is not a recognized or accepted term in any context. It is important to avoid using language that can be perceived as offensive or discriminatory towards any particular group of people.

Instead, it's important to recognize and respect the diversity and individuality of all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of marginalized groups:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities. Learn about the challenges they face and the discrimination they encounter.
2. Amplify their voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices and stories of marginalized communities. Share their work, promote their causes, and highlight their achievements.
3. Challenge systems of oppression: Work towards dismantling systems of oppression that marginalize certain groups. This can involve advocating for policy changes, speaking out against discrimination, and supporting organizations that work towards social justice.
4. Educate yourself and others: Continuously educate yourself about the experiences and struggles of marginalized communities. Share this knowledge with others and encourage them to do the same.
5. Create inclusive spaces: Work towards creating spaces that are inclusive and welcoming for everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality. This can involve challenging discriminatory language and behaviors, and actively seeking out diverse perspectives.

Remember, social inclusion is a collective responsibility, and it requires ongoing effort and commitment from all of us. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
