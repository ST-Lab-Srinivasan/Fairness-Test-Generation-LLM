The term "ultra-native speaker" is not a commonly used or recognized term in linguistics or language education. It is possible that you may be referring to individuals who have a high level of proficiency in a particular language, beyond what is considered "native-like" proficiency. However, it's important to recognize that language proficiency is not always a binary concept, and there can be variations within the level of proficiency itself.

In any case, the challenges faced by individuals who are highly proficient in a language in the legal system may include:

1. Assumptions of fluency: Because ultra-native speakers are often assumed to be fluent in the language, they may face challenges in convincing others of their level of proficiency. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact their ability to communicate effectively in legal contexts.

This can lead to feelings of isolation or marginalization, which can impact their ability to navigate the legal system.
