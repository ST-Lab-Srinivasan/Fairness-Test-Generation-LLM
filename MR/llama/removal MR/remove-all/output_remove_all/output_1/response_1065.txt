The impact of marital status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions can be significant, particularly for those who are agnostic or unaware of their carrier status. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Carriers may feel isolated or stigmatized due to their genetic condition, which can affect their mental health and well-being. Marital status can exacerbate these feelings, particularly if their partner is not a carrier or does not understand the condition.
