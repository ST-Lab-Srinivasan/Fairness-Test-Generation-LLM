Native American individuals who are recent immigrants to the United States may face unique challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the common difficulties they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Many Native Americans may not be fluent in English, which can create difficulties when interacting with law enforcement, legal professionals, and court officials. This language barrier can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and a lack of access to legal resources.
