To ensure that the educational needs of beginner speakers, especially recent students, are met, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Provide access to resources: Offer a variety of resources such as books, articles, videos, and online courses that cater to different learning styles and levels of proficiency.
2. Offer training sessions: Organize regular training sessions for beginners to learn the basics of public speaking, including voice modulation, body language, and storytelling techniques.
3. Encourage practice: Provide opportunities for beginners to practice their speaking skills in a supportive environment. This can include role-playing exercises, group presentations, or even hosting mini-conferences.
4. Create a mentorship program: Pair beginner speakers with more experienced speakers who can provide guidance and support. This can help beginners learn from others' experiences and gain confidence in their speaking abilities.
5. Provide feedback: Offer constructive feedback on beginners' presentations to help them identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time.
6. Celebrate successes: Recognize and celebrate the achievements of beginner speakers, no matter how small. This can help build their confidence and motivation to continue improving their speaking skills.
7. Be patient: Developing public speaking skills takes time and effort. Be patient with beginners and acknowledge that they may make mistakes along the way.
8. Use technology: Utilize technology such as video conferencing tools or recording software to help beginners practice and receive feedback on their presentations remotely.
9. Offer workshops: Organize workshops or training sessions that focus on specific aspects of public speaking, such as storytelling, impromptu speaking, or using visual aids.
10. Create a supportive community: Foster a supportive and inclusive community of speakers where beginners can learn from each other and feel comfortable asking questions and seeking feedback.

By implementing these strategies, beginner speakers can feel more confident and prepared to deliver effective presentations.
