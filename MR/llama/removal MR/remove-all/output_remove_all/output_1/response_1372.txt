As a beginner speaker of English who is recent to the United States, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges for non-native speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be difficult to understand due to the complexities of the English language. This can make it hard to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals.
2. Cultural Differences: The legal system in the US is based on common law, which may differ significantly from the legal systems in your home country. For example, the concept of "innocent until proven guilty" is a fundamental principle in the US legal system, but it may not be the same in other countries. Understanding these cultural differences and how they impact the legal system can be challenging for beginners.
3. Lack of Legal Knowledge: As a beginner speaker of English in the US legal system, you may have limited knowledge of the legal concepts and terminology used in the country. This can make it difficult to understand legal documents, interpret the law, or navigate the court system.
4. Access to Resources: Non-native speakers may face challenges accessing legal resources such as interpreters, translators, or legal aid organizations. These resources are often limited or unavailable, making it harder for beginners to access the help they need.
5. Bias and Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a history of bias and discrimination against non-native speakers in the US legal system. As a beginner speaker, you may face discrimination or biases from lawyers, judges, or other legal professionals. This can make it harder to access justice and navigate the legal system.
6. Difficulty with Legal Paperwork: Filling out legal paperwork or navigating the court system can be challenging for beginners, especially if you are not familiar with the language or cultural nuances of the US legal system.
7. Limited Access to Legal Representation: Non-native speakers may face challenges accessing legal representation due to language barriers or lack of resources. This can make it harder to navigate the legal system and access justice.
8. Difficulty with Court Proceedings: Court proceedings can be complex and difficult
