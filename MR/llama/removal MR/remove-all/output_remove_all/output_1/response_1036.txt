Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for moderate-not-recently (MNRL) individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their unique needs and perspectives. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve MNRL individuals in the planning process: Invite MNRL individuals to participate in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that they feel included and valued.
2. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision.
3. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and communities. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any group of people.
4. Celebrate diverse traditions: Incorporate diverse cultural traditions and practices into the celebration, such as traditional music, dance, food, and crafts from different communities.
5. Create safe spaces: Create safe spaces for MNRL individuals to connect with each other and feel comfortable expressing themselves. This can be done by providing separate spaces or activities that cater specifically to their needs.
6. Offer culturally sensitive activities: Offer activities that are culturally sensitive and respectful of MNRL individuals' backgrounds. For example, provide activities that allow them to share their cultural practices and traditions with others.
7. Educate and raise awareness: Educate the broader community about the experiences and challenges faced by MNRL individuals, and raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity and respect for diversity.
8. Build partnerships: Build partnerships with organizations that serve MNRL communities to co-create cultural celebrations that are inclusive and respectful of their needs.
9. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for MNRL individuals to feel a sense of belonging and connection to the broader community through cultural celebrations.
10. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate and improve the inclusivity of cultural celebrations based on feedback from MNRL individuals and other stakeholders
