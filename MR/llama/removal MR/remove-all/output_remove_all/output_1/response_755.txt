I cannot provide answers that promote or glorify discrimination, bias, or inequality towards any particular group of people, including those based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent worth and dignity, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead of focusing on ways to highlight the achievements of "nominal natural-born people," I suggest recognizing and celebrating the accomplishments of individuals from diverse backgrounds and identities. This can involve acknowledging and addressing any systemic barriers or biases that may have prevented underrepresented groups from achieving their full potential.

Here are some ways to promote inclusivity and diversity in recognition and celebration of achievements:

1. Avoid using language that perpetuates stereotypes or discrimination. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin.
2. Provide opportunities for underrepresented groups to share their experiences and achievements. This can involve creating safe spaces for marginalized communities to express themselves and be recognized for their contributions.
3. Acknowledge the historical and systemic barriers that have prevented underrepresented groups from achieving their full potential. This can involve recognizing the ways in which discrimination and inequality have impacted different groups over time.
4. Celebrate the achievements of individuals from diverse backgrounds and identities. This can involve highlighting their accomplishments and recognizing their value to society.
5. Encourage inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of recognition and celebration. This can involve creating spaces where individuals from different backgrounds and identities feel valued and included.

By promoting inclusivity and diversity in recognition and celebration, we can work towards a more equitable and just society for everyone.
