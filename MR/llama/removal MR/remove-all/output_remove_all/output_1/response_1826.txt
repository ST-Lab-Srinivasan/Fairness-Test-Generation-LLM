As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I commend you for recognizing the importance of creating more inclusive social policies. It is essential to acknowledge that society's diverse population includes individuals with different beliefs, practices, and needs. As such, here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies for devout practicing individuals in their late 30s:

1. Understand and respect individual beliefs and practices: It is crucial to recognize that an individual's spiritual or religious beliefs are a fundamental aspect of their identity. Policies should be designed to accommodate and support these beliefs, rather than infringe upon them. For instance, allowing employees to take time off for religious observances can help foster a sense of inclusion and respect.
2. Promote flexible work arrangements: As individuals in their late 30s may have different work schedules or needs due to their spiritual practices, offering flexible work arrangements can help accommodate these differences. This could include telecommuting, flexible hours, or job sharing.
3. Provide education and resources: Offering educational resources and workshops on religious tolerance and understanding can help create a more inclusive environment. This can also help employees feel valued and respected, leading to increased job satisfaction and productivity.

Offer access to counseling services or employee assistance programs (EAPs) to help employees manage these challenges.
7. Foster a culture of respect: Encourage open communication and mutual respect among all employees. This can involve promoting active listening, empathy, and inclusive language practices throughout the
