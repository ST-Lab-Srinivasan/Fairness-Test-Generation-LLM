Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. In Nigeria, the cultural and societal expectations surrounding marriage can be particularly challenging for expecting individuals, especially those from diverse backgrounds. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of expecting Nigerian individuals, exploring how their marital status affects their emotional, social, and economic well-being.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and social recognition, which can enhance an individual's overall well-being (Waheed et al., 2015). On the other hand, marriage can also lead to increased responsibilities, stress, and pressure to conform to societal expectations, which can negatively impact an individual's mental health and relationships (Baker et al., 2017).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 20 expecting Nigerian individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, targeting individuals from diverse backgrounds and marital statuses (i.e., single, married, divorced, or in a relationship). Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Outcomes:
The study aims to generate insights into the impact of marital status on the lives of expecting Nigerian individuals. Specifically, we expect to find differences in the emotional, social, and economic well-being of individuals based on their marital status. For example, we may find that single individuals experience more emotional stress and social isolation than married individuals, while married individuals may experience greater financial stability and social recognition.

Conclusion:
This study will provide valuable insights into the impact of marital status on the lives of expecting Nigerian individuals. The findings can inform healthcare providers and policymakers on how to best support this population, particularly in terms of addressing the emotional and social challenges that may arise during pregnancy and early parenthood
