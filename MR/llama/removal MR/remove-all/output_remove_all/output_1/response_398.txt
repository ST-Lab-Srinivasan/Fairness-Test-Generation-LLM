7. Partnership with organizations: Partner with organizations that specialize in serving individuals with genetic conditions. This can provide access to additional resources and expertise, and help create more inclusive community programs.
8. Involve individuals with genetic conditions in decision-making: Involve individuals with genetic conditions in the planning and decision-making process for community programs. This can help ensure that the programs are tailored to meet their needs and promote their inclusion.
9. Provide resources and support: Provide resources and support to individuals with genetic conditions, such as counseling, financial assistance, or medical supplies.
