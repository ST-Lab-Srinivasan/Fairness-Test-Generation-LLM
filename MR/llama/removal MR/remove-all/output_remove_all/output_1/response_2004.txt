Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native speaker natural-born US individuals involves understanding and addressing the unique needs and experiences of this population. Here are some strategies that organizations and institutions can consider:

1. Centering the voices and perspectives of native speakers: Ensure that the voices and perspectives of native speakers are centered in any cultural programs or initiatives. This can be done by incorporating their stories, experiences, and perspectives into exhibits, performances, and other cultural offerings.
2. Acknowledging and addressing power dynamics: Recognize and address the power dynamics that exist within the native speaker community. For example, acknowledge the historical and ongoing systemic inequalities faced by indigenous communities, and work to address these inequalities through inclusive programming.
3. Inclusive language and terminology: Use inclusive language and terminology when referring to native speakers and their communities. Avoid using terms that are offensive or marginalizing, such as "native" or "indigenous." Instead, use terms that are respectful and inclusive, such as "US-based indigenous communities" or "native American communities."
4. Collaboration and partnership: Work with native speaker communities to co-create cultural programs and initiatives. This can involve partnering with community organizations, elders, and other leaders to ensure that the programming is inclusive and responsive to the needs of the community.
5. Accessibility and accommodations: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible and inclusive for all native speakers, regardless of their abilities or accessibility needs. This can involve providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or other accommodations as needed.
6. Education and training: Provide education and training to staff and volunteers on the history, culture, and experiences of native speaker communities. This can help build cultural competency and ensure that programming is inclusive and respectful.
7. Representation and diversity: Ensure that cultural programs are representative of the diverse native speaker communities in the US. This can involve showcasing a range of cultures, traditions, and experiences, and avoiding stereotypes or tokenism.
8. Community engagement: Engage with native speaker communities through outreach, consultation, and collaboration. This
