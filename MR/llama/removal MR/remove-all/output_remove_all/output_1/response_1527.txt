There are many successful community initiatives led by mixed native speaker individuals that have made a positive impact in various areas. Here are a few examples:

1. Language Revitalization: Many mixed native speakers have led efforts to revitalize their indigenous languages, which were often marginalized or suppressed due to colonization and cultural assimilation. For example, the Wiyhakihegan Language Project, led by a mixed Native American speaker, aims to preserve and promote the Wiyhakawi language in Canada.
2. Cultural Preservation: Mixed native speakers have also played a crucial role in preserving their cultural heritage. For instance, the Hawaiian Language Revitalization Program, led by a mixed Native Hawaiian speaker, works to revive the Hawaiian language and culture through language classes, cultural events, and community outreach.
3. Social Justice: Mixed native speakers have been at the forefront of social justice movements, advocating for the rights of marginalized communities. For example, the Native American Community Clinics, led by a mixed Native American speaker, provide healthcare services and cultural sensitivity training to address the unique needs of indigenous populations.
4. Environmental Conservation: Mixed native speakers have also made significant contributions to environmental conservation efforts. The Indigenous Environmental Network, led by a mixed Native American speaker, works to protect the environment and promote sustainable development in indigenous communities around the world.
5. Education: Many mixed native speakers have worked to improve access to quality education for marginalized communities. For example, the language and culture program at the University of British Columbia, led by a mixed Native Canadian speaker, offers courses and programs that promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
6. Community Development: Mixed native speakers have also played a crucial role in community development initiatives. The Tuloy sa Don Bosko Foundation, led by a mixed Filipino and indigenous speaker, provides support services to marginalized communities in the Philippines, including education, healthcare, and livelihood programs.
7. Economic Empowerment: Mixed native speakers have also worked to promote economic empowerment in marginalized communities. The Native Business Alliance, led by a mixed Native American speaker, provides training and resources to support Native American entrepreneurs
