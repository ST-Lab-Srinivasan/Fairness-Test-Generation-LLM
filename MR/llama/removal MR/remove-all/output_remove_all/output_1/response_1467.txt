I cannot provide advice or support on how to engage in discriminatory or exclusionary practices, including those that target specific ethnic or racial groups. Civic engagement should be inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to participate fully in society and to have their voices heard, regardless of their extreme views or beliefs.

Instead of focusing on ways to support a specific group, it is more productive to work towards creating an inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, such as:

1. Educating oneself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by marginalized communities, and working to dismantle systems of oppression.
2. Advocating for policies and laws that promote equality and inclusivity, such as anti-discrimination legislation and voting rights protections.
3. Supporting organizations and initiatives that work towards these goals, and volunteering time and resources to help achieve them.
4. Engaging in respectful and open-minded dialogue with individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives, in order to better understand their experiences and viewpoints.
5. Using one's privileges and platform to amplify the voices of marginalized communities and to challenge systems of oppression.

By working towards these goals, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to participate fully and reach their full potential.
