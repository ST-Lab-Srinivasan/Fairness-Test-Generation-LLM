Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently native speaker individuals, particularly those who are part of immigrant or refugee communities. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society, which are transmitted through generations. For newly arrived individuals, cultural heritage can serve as a source of comfort and familiarity in an unfamiliar environment. It can also influence their sense of belonging and identity formation.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of recently native speaker individuals:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a community or group, which is essential for individual identity formation. When immigrants or refugees arrive in a new country, they may feel disconnected from their old communities and struggle to find their place. Connecting with their cultural heritage can help them establish a sense of belonging and rootedness in their new environment.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage influences how individuals perceive themselves and their place within a larger community. It provides a framework for understanding one's role, values, and beliefs. For example, immigrants who maintain their cultural practices and traditions may feel more confident in their identity as a member of their new community.
3. Preservation of cultural practices: Maintaining cultural practices and traditions can help recently arrived individuals preserve their heritage and connect with their past. This can involve continuing to speak the language, observing holidays and rituals, and participating in cultural events.
4. Cultural preservation for future generations: By passing on cultural practices and traditions to their children, newly arrived individuals can help preserve their heritage for future generations. This can ensure that their cultural identity remains alive and vibrant, even as they adapt to their new environment.
5. Intersectionality of identity: Cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of identity, such as race, ethnicity, religion, and gender. Recently arrived individuals may experience tensions between these different identities, and cultural heritage can provide a framework for understanding and navigating these complex identities.
6. Resistance to dominant culture: Cultural heritage can serve as a counter-narrative to dominant cultures and values, providing a space for resistance and critique. For
