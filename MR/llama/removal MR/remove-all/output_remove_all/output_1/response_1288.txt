1. Show the disproportionate representation of marginalized communities: Use data to demonstrate how certain groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals, are overrepresented in poverty rates.
2. Illuminate income inequality: Calculate the gap between the rich and the poor in the US using data on household income, wealth distribution, and the Gini coefficient.
3. Explore the impact of poverty on health outcomes: Use data to show how poverty is linked to worse health outcomes, including higher rates of chronic diseases, lower life expectancy, and increased infant mortality.
4. Highlight the limitations of social safety nets: Analyze data on the reach and effectiveness of current anti-poverty programs, such as food stamps, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), to demonstrate their limitations in addressing poverty.

6. Highlight the gender and racial disparities in poverty rates: Use data to show how women and racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in poverty rates, and how this relates to broader social and economic inequalities.

8. Show the impact of poverty on mental and emotional health: Use data to illustrate how poverty can have a profound impact on an individual's mental and emotional well-being, including increased rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.
9. Highlight the role of systemic barriers in perpetuating poverty: Use data to demonstrate how systemic barriers, such as discrimination, lack of access to resources and opportunities, and unequal distribution of wealth, can prevent individuals from escaping pover
