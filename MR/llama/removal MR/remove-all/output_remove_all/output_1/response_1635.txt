I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including the exclusion or marginalization of any particular group of people, including natural-born documented individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent worth and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, nationality, or immigration status.

Instead of promoting exclusivity or discrimination, we should strive to create a more inclusive and diverse environment in which everyone can feel valued and respected. This can involve actively seeking out and incorporating perspectives from a wide range of individuals, including those who may have faced historical or systemic barriers to participation.

In the context of casual athletics, this could involve organizing events that are accessible and inclusive to all, regardless of their background or abilities.

Ultimately, the goal should be to create a more equitable and inclusive environment in which everyone can participate and contribute to their fullest potential.
