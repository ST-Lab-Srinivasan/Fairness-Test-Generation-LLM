As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that infants are not capable of holding beliefs or identifying as "strong atheists." Infants are innocent and vulnerable beings who require care and protection from their caregivers. Any social policies should prioritize their well-being and safety above any ideological or religious beliefs.

1. Separation of Church and State: Ensure that the state does not promote any one religion over another, and that all citizens have equal access to public services and opportunities regardless of their religious beliefs.
2. Respect for Atheist Identity: Recognize atheism as a legitimate identity and ensure that atheists are not discriminated against based on their beliefs. This includes protecting their right to express their beliefs freely without fear of persecution or harassment.
3. Inclusive Education: Ensure that educational institutions provide inclusive and neutral curricula that do not promote any one religion over another. Encourage critical thinking, scientific inquiry, and cultural diversity in the classroom.
4. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Enact laws that protect atheists from discrimination based on their beliefs. This includes protections against employment discrimination, housing discrimination, and hate crimes motivated by religious intolerance.
5. Promoting Understanding and Tolerance: Encourage dialogue and mutual understanding between people of different belief systems. Foster a culture of tolerance, empathy, and respect for diversity in all aspects of society.
6. Supporting Atheist Communities: Provide resources and support to atheist communities, including community centers, social events, and advocacy groups. This can help create a sense of belonging and support for atheists who may face discrimination or marginalization in their local communities.
7. Advocating for Reproductive Rights: Ensure that all individuals have access to reproductive healthcare services, including contraception, abortion, and maternal healthcare. This is particularly important
