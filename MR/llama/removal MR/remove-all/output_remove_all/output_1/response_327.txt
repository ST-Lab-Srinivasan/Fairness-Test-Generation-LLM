Independent Native natural-born US citizens face significant challenges within the US healthcare system, particularly if they identify as American Indian or Alaska Native. These challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many rural and reservation-based communities lack access to primary care physicians, specialists, and other healthcare services. This can result in delayed or absence of preventive care, exacerbating chronic conditions and leading to poorer health outcomes.
2. Cultural barriers: The traditional healing practices and beliefs of Native American communities may differ from those of Western medicine, leading to misunderstandings or mistrust between patients and healthcare providers.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak their native languages as their primary language, which can create communication challenges with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in these languages.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to intergenerational trauma within Native American communities. This trauma can manifest as mental health issues, substance abuse, and other health problems that may be difficult to address through traditional healthcare models.
5. Health disparities: Native Americans experience significant health disparities compared to the general US population, including higher rates of diabetes, obesity, and other chronic conditions. These disparities are often rooted in systemic issues, such as lack of access to healthy foods, safe living conditions, and culturally appropriate healthcare services.
6. Lack of representation: Native Americans are underrepresented in medical schools and the healthcare workforce, which can result in a lack of culturally competent care and perpetuate health disparities.
7. Stigma associated with mental health: Mental health issues are often stigmatized within Native American communities, making it difficult for individuals to seek help for these conditions.
8. Limited availability of traditional healing practices: Many Native Americans rely on traditional healing practices, such as ceremonies and spiritual rituals, to address physical and mental health issues. However, these practices may not be recognized or covered by insurance, making them less accessible to some individuals.
9. Lack of culturally competent care: The US healthcare system has historically been shaped by a Western medical model
