Creating more inclusive community events for beginner speakers in the upper population requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your event location is wheelchair-accessible, has a clear path of travel, and provides adequate seating and restroom facilities for attendees with disabilities. Provide alternative formats (e.g., large print, Braille) for materials and information.
2. Communication: Offer multiple ways to communicate, such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, live captioning, or audio descriptions. This will help ensure that all attendees can participate and understand the content.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all event materials, avoiding terms that may be offensive or marginalizing to any group. Avoid assuming gender or cultural identities, and use gender-neutral language when possible.
4. Diverse speakers: Ensure that your speaker lineup is diverse and represents a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and provide attendees with role models and mentors.
5. Accommodations: Offer accommodations for attendees who may need additional support, such as audio feedback headphones or sign language interpreters. Provide a quiet room or area for attendees who may be overwhelmed or need a break from the main event.
6. Inclusive programming: Plan events that cater to a range of interests and needs, including topics related to disability, mental health, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation. Ensure that your programming is inclusive and respectful of all attendees.
7. Volunteer training: Provide training for volunteers and staff on how to create a welcoming and inclusive environment. This can include information on accessibility, communication, and cultural sensitivity.
8. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate attendees with different needs and preferences. For example, provide multiple session times or offer online event options for those who cannot attend in person.
9. Community outreach: Reach out to local organizations that serve upper population groups,
