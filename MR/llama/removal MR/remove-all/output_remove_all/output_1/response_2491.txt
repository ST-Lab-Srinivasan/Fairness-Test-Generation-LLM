Addressing the needs of "not recently non-individuals" in disaster response requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Planning: Involve diverse communities in disaster planning and response efforts, including those who have been historically marginalized or excluded. This includes individuals with disabilities, older adults, and those from low-income and minority communities.
2. Accessible Communication: Ensure that communication channels are accessible to all, including those with hearing, visual, or cognitive impairments. Provide information in multiple formats, such as Braille, large print, or audio, and use clear and simple language.
3. Accommodating Needs: Take into account the unique needs of individuals with disabilities, older adults, and those from marginalized communities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpreters, or culturally sensitive messaging.
4. Training and Education: Provide training for response personnel on how to interact with diverse populations and address their specific needs during a disaster. This can include cultural competency training, disability awareness training, and age-appropriate information for older adults.
5. Building Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that serve diverse communities to ensure response efforts are inclusive and effective. This includes partnering with disability groups, community-based organizations, and social service agencies.

These plans should include procedures for evacuation, sheltering, and communication during a disaster.
7. Inclusive Shelters: Ensure that shelters are accessible and accommodating for all individuals, including those with disabilities. Provide accessible amenities such as wheelchair-accessible bathrooms, elevators, and adaptive equipment.
