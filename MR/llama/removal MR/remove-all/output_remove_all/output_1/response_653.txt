Creating more inclusive social policies for nominal individuals requires understanding and addressing the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies that policymakers and advocates can use to promote greater inclusion:

1. Acknowledge and recognize nominal identities: The first step is to acknowledge and recognize the diversity of nominal identities, including non-binary, genderqueer, and third-gender individuals. This involves creating spaces where these identities are validated and respected.
2. Develop inclusive language policies: Develop language policies that recognize and use the full range of nominal identities. For example, use gender-neutral language in official documents and communication, and avoid assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
3. Implement gender-neutral laws and regulations: Review existing laws and regulations to ensure they are inclusive of all genders. For example, create gender-neutral marriage laws, eliminate gender-based discrimination in education and employment, and provide equal access to healthcare for all individuals regardless of their gender identity.
4. Support LGBTQ+ organizations: Provide financial and logistical support to LGBTQ+ organizations that work towards promoting the rights and well-being of nominal individuals. This can include funding for advocacy, education, and healthcare initiatives.
5. Create safe spaces: Establish safe spaces where nominal individuals can socialize, access healthcare, and seek support without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can include gender-neutral restrooms, showers, and locker rooms in schools, workplaces, and public facilities.
6. Offer gender-neutral identification options: Provide gender-neutral identification options, such as "non-binary" or "genderqueer," on official documents like passports, driver's licenses, and birth certificates. This can help validate the identities of nominal individuals and reduce discrimination.
7. Train professionals in LGBTQ+ issues: Provide training for professionals who interact with nominal individuals, such as teachers, healthcare providers, and law enforcement officers. This can help ensure that these individuals receive appropriate support and care without facing discrimination or harassment.
8. Encourage representation in media
