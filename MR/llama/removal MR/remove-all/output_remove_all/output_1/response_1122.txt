I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to economically empower any particular group of people based on their ethnicity or race. The idea of "ethnically full upper upper" individuals is not a recognized societal category, and it is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent value and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Instead of focusing on divisive and exclusionary ideas, it is important to work towards creating an equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. This can involve addressing systemic inequalities and structural barriers that prevent marginalized communities from achieving their full potential.

Some ways to support the economic empowerment of marginalized communities include:

1. Education and job training programs: Providing access to education and job training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market and access better-paying jobs.
2. Microfinance initiatives: Microfinance programs provide small loans and other financial services to individuals who do not have access to traditional banking services, helping them to start or grow their own businesses.
3. Entrepreneurship support: Providing resources and support to entrepreneurs from marginalized communities can help them to launch and grow successful businesses, creating jobs and economic opportunities for themselves and their communities.
4. Community development initiatives: Investing in community development programs can help to build stronger, more resilient communities by providing access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion can help to address systemic inequalities and create a more level playing field for marginalized communities.

It is important to recognize that economic empowerment is not a solo endeavor, but rather a collective effort that requires the involvement of individuals, organizations, and governments working together towards a common goal.
