Promoting the accessibility of public services for nomadic non-individuals, such as homeless people or those living in poverty, requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and political barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Inclusive service design: Ensure that public services are designed with the needs of nomadic non-individuals in mind. This includes providing accessible facilities, adaptable scheduling, and flexible payment options. For example, a city could provide mobile banking services or allow for online payments to make it easier for people without stable addresses to access public services.
2. Outreach and engagement: Reach out to nomadic non-individuals through community outreach programs, street outreach, or partnerships with organizations that serve these populations. Provide information about available services and encourage them to access them. Listen to their needs and concerns to tailor services to meet their specific requirements.
3. Capacity building: Offer training and capacity-building programs for nomadic non-individuals to develop skills in areas such as financial literacy, digital literacy, and advocacy. This can help them navigate the system more effectively and assert their rights.
4. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address the root causes of poverty and homelessness, such as affordable housing, income support, and access to healthcare. Work with government agencies and community organizations to push for policy changes that promote the rights and well-being of nomadic non-individuals.
5. Alternative service delivery models: Explore alternative service delivery models, such as mobile service delivery or pop-up service centers, that can reach nomadic non-individuals where they are. These models can help bridge the gap between public services and marginalized communities.
6. Partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with community-based organizations that serve nomadic non-individuals to provide holistic support and link them to available services. These partnerships can help build trust and increase access to services.
7. Public awareness campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns to educate the broader community about the issues faced by nomadic non-individuals and the importance of inclusive service
