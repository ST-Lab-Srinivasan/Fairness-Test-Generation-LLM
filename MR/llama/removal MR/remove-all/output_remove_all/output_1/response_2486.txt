Addressing the needs of "Not Recently" Non-Individuals in Disaster Response: A Framework
=====================================================================================

Introduction
------------

The term "Not Recently" Non-Individuals (NRNI) refers to individuals or groups who have been historically marginalized, excluded, or overlooked in disaster response efforts. This includes people such as refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), minority communities, and those living in remote or hard-to-reach areas. The needs of NRNI are often overlooked or insufficiently addressed during disaster responses, leading to worsened outcomes for these individuals and communities.

This framework aims to provide a comprehensive approach to addressing the needs of NRNI in disaster response efforts. By prioritizing their inclusion and engagement, we can improve disaster preparedness, response, and recovery outcomes for all individuals affected by a disaster.
