As a beginner speaker of mixed heritage, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Lack of cultural understanding: The legal system is often built on a framework of Western cultural values and assumptions, which can make it difficult for individuals from diverse backgrounds to navigate. For example, the concept of "innocent until proven guilty" may not be universally understood or valued in all cultures.

3. Racism and discrimination: Unfortunately, racism and discrimination are still prevalent in many legal systems around the world.
