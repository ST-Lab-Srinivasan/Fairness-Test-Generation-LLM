To highlight the issues faced by strongly not newly individuals, we can use data to identify and analyze patterns in their experiences. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Create a survey or interview protocol that specifically targets strongly not newly individuals. Ask open-ended questions to gather detailed information about their experiences, such as "Can you describe a time when you felt like an outsider in your own community?" or "How have you experienced discrimination or marginalization based on your identity?"
2. Analyze demographic data: Use demographic data to identify trends and patterns in the experiences of strongly not newly individuals. For example, you could analyze data on the poverty rates, education levels, and employment outcomes of individuals from different racial or ethnic groups to identify disparities.
3. Map data: Use mapping tools to visualize data on the experiences of strongly not newly individuals. For example, you could map the locations of hate crimes or discrimination incidents to identify patterns of where these events are occurring.
4. Use statistical analysis: Use statistical analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data collected. For example, you could use regression analysis to examine the relationship between different factors (such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status) and experiences of discrimination or marginalization.
5. Create data visualizations: Create interactive data visualizations to help communicate the issues faced by strongly not newly individuals. For example, you could create an interactive map that shows the locations of hate crimes or discrimination incidents, or a chart that displays the demographic data on poverty rates and employment outcomes for different racial or ethnic groups.
6. Use machine learning algorithms: Use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data collected. For example, you could use natural language processing techniques to analyze text data from surveys or interviews to identify themes and trends in the experiences of strongly not newly individuals.
7. Compare data across different groups: Compare the data collected on strongly not newly individuals with data collected on other marginalized groups (such as racial or ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, etc.) to identify common themes and trends in their experiences.
8. Use data to advocate for policy change: Use the data collected
