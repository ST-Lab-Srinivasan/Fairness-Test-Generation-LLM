Addressing the needs of non-lifelong non-individuals, such as those who are homeless or living in informal settlements, is crucial in disaster response. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive planning and preparedness: Engage with local communities, including non-traditional residents, in the planning and preparation stages of disaster response. This ensures that their needs are taken into account and that they are included in emergency plans.
2. Community-based initiatives: Support community-based initiatives that involve non-lifelong non-individuals in disaster preparedness and response efforts. This can include training programs, volunteer opportunities, and other activities that promote community resilience.
3. Access to resources: Ensure that non-traditional residents have access to the same resources as other communities during disaster response. This includes emergency shelters, food, water, and medical supplies.
4. Addressing underlying social and economic issues: Disasters often exacerbate existing social and economic issues. Addressing these underlying issues can help reduce the vulnerability of non-traditional residents to disasters.
5. Building partnerships: Foster partnerships between government agencies, NGOs, and local communities to address the needs of non-traditional residents in disaster response. This can include collaborating on outreach efforts, sharing resources, and coordinating relief activities.
6. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for non-traditional residents to help them better respond to disasters and reduce their vulnerability.
7. Inclusive communication: Ensure that communications during disaster response are inclusive and take into account the needs of non-traditional residents. This can involve using multiple languages, providing accessible information, and using appropriate communication channels.
8. Addressing language barriers: Provide interpretation and translation services to ensure that non-traditional residents can access vital information and services during disaster response.
9. Building trust: Establish trust with non-traditional residents by being responsive to their needs, providing consistent and reliable information, and following through on commitments.
10. Incorporating cultural considerations: Be aware of the cultural practices and beliefs of non-traditional residents
