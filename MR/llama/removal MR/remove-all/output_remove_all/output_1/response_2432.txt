Meeting the educational needs of beginner speaker individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and provides them with the necessary tools and resources to improve their speaking skills. Here are some strategies that can help ensure the educational needs of beginner speaker individuals are met:

1. Assess their learning style: Beginner speakers have different learning styles, such as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. Understanding their preferred learning style can help tailor the educational content to meet their needs. For example, visual learners may benefit from watching videos or animations, while auditory learners may prefer listening to audio recordings.
2. Provide interactive content: Interactive content such as quizzes, games, and exercises can help beginner speakers engage with the material and retain information better. For instance, a speaking app could offer interactive activities like voice recording sessions or speech therapy exercises.
3. Offer personalized feedback: Personalized feedback is essential for beginner speakers to identify areas of improvement and track their progress. AI-powered speech recognition technology can provide immediate feedback on pronunciation, intonation, and other speaking skills, helping learners adjust their techniques accordingly.
4. Foster a supportive learning environment: Beginner speakers may feel anxious or self-conscious about speaking in front of others. Creating a supportive learning environment that encourages risk-taking and provides constructive feedback can help them overcome these feelings and build confidence.
5. Encourage repetition and practice: Repetition is key to improving speaking skills, especially for beginner speakers. Encouraging learners to practice regularly, either through self-practice or with the guidance of a speech therapist, can help them develop muscle memory and improve their overall proficiency.
6. Provide opportunities for live interaction: Beginner speakers benefit from interacting with others in a face-to-face setting. Offering opportunities for live interaction, such as group speaking sessions or peer review and feedback, can help them gain practical experience and receive constructive feedback.
7. Use storytelling techniques: Storytelling is an effective way to engage learners and help them retain information. Using narratives or anecdotes to illustrate speaking skills can make the learning process more enjoyable and memorable for beginner speakers
