The challenges faced by native speaker, ethnically full people in the legal system can vary depending on the specific context and location. However, some common challenges that have been identified include:

1. Racial bias: Native speakers of a language may face racial bias or discrimination in the legal system, which can affect their treatment under the law. For example, studies have shown that African Americans are more likely to be wrongly convicted than white Americans due to implicit biases held by jurors and other legal actors.
2. Language barriers: Native speakers of a language may face barriers to accessing legal services or understanding the legal process due to a lack of proficiency in the dominant language of the legal system. This can lead to difficulties in navigating the legal system, particularly for those who are not fluent in the language of the court.
3. Cultural misunderstandings: Native speakers of a language may face cultural misunderstandings or miscommunications within the legal system, which can result from differences in cultural norms and values. For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on collectivism than individualism, which can lead to misunderstandings in a legal system that prioritizes individual rights.
4. Lack of representation: Native speakers of a language may face challenges accessing legal representation due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can result in a lack of understanding of the legal process and limited access to legal resources.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Native speakers of a language may face stigma or discrimination within the legal system, particularly if they are perceived as "foreign" or "other." This can lead to difficulties in accessing legal services or being taken seriously by legal actors.
6. Limited access to legal resources: Native speakers of a language may have limited access to legal resources such as interpreters, translators, and cultural consultants. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access legal services.
7.

This can result in a lack of accountability for legal actors who engage in discriminatory practices.
