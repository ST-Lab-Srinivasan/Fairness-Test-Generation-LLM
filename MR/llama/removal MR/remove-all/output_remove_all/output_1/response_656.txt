Ensuring that the housing needs of devout individuals are met requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach that takes into account their unique requirements and cultural sensitivities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1.

This can be achieved through consultation with community leaders and members, and by conducting surveys or focus groups.

These services can also provide emotional and spiritual support to residents who may be experiencing cultural shock or stress.
