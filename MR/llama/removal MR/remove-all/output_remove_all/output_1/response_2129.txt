Infants born prematurely (before 37 weeks of gestation) or in the first trimester of pregnancy face several challenges in the healthcare system. These challenges can be related to their medical condition, developmental needs, and the complexity of their care. Some of the common challenges faced by infants in this category include:

1. Lack of standardized care protocols: Premature and very low birth weight (VLBW) infants require specialized care that is often not available in all hospitals or regions. A lack of standardized care protocols can lead to variations in the quality of care provided, which can impact outcomes for these infants.
2. Limited access to neonatologists and other specialists: Premature and VLBW infants often require multiple medical interventions, such as oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and medications. Limited access to neonatologists and other specialists can delay or withhold these interventions, compromising the infant's health and well-being.
3. Difficulty in providing adequate pain management: Premature and VLBW infants may experience significant discomfort and pain due to their medical condition. However, they may have difficulty receiving appropriate pain management due to their small size or respiratory problems.
4. Risk of nosocomial infections: Premature and VLBW infants are at increased risk of developing nosocomial infections (infections acquired during hospitalization) due to their immature immune systems and exposure to potentially contaminated equipment and surfaces.
5. Emotional and psychological distress: Parents of premature and VLBW infants may experience significant emotional and psychological distress due to the uncertainty and potential complications associated with their child's condition.
6. Difficulty in coordinating care between multiple providers: Premature and VLBW infants often require care from multiple providers, including pediatricians, neonatologists, and specialists. Coordinating care between these providers can be challenging, potentially leading to delays or errors in treatment.
7. Limited availability of specialized equipment and resources: Some premature and VLBW infants
