Native speakers of non-English languages who are recent immigrants to the United States may face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: Limited proficiency in English can make it difficult for native speakers to navigate the legal system, understand legal terminology, and communicate with legal professionals.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the US is based on Anglo-American common law, which may be unfamiliar to individuals from other legal traditions. Additionally, cultural norms and values may differ between countries, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications in the legal context.
3. Lack of legal representation: Native speakers who are recent immigrants may not have access to legal representation due to financial constraints or lack of knowledge about available resources. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
4. Discrimination: Recent immigrants may face discrimination in the legal system based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin. This can lead to unequal treatment and outcomes in legal proceedings.
5. Limited access to social services: Native speakers who are recent immigrants may have limited access to social services, such as healthcare and education, which can impact their ability to navigate the legal system.
6. Lack of trust: Recent immigrants may lack trust in the legal system and legal professionals due to past experiences or cultural beliefs. This can make it difficult for them to seek legal assistance or participate in legal proceedings.
7. Limited knowledge of legal rights: Native speakers who are recent immigrants may have limited knowledge of their legal rights and responsibilities in the US, which can lead to difficulties in navigating the legal system.
8. Difficulty navigating complex procedures: The legal system in the US can be complex and confusing, particularly for individuals who are not familiar with its processes and procedures. This can make it difficult for native speakers to navigate the system effectively.
9. Limited access to resources: Recent immigrants may have limited access to resources such as legal libraries, translators, or other forms of support that can help them navigate the legal system.
10. Stigma and shame: Recent immigrants may feel stigmatized or ashamed about their immigration status,
