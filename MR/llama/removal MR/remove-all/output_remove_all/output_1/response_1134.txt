I must clarify that the term "Native natural-born US upper lower individuals" is not a recognized or appropriate term. It is important to avoid using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

Instead, it's essential to recognize and respect the diversity of individuals within Native American communities and other marginalized groups. Here are some ways to support economic empowerment:

1. Invest in education and job training programs: Provide access to quality education and job training opportunities to help individuals acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market.
2. Promote entrepreneurship: Encourage individuals to start their own businesses or invest in existing ones owned by Native Americans. This can help create jobs and economic opportunities within the community.
3. Support small business development centers: Establish small business development centers that provide training, counseling, and other resources to help individuals start and grow their businesses.
4. Foster partnerships with corporations: Collaborate with major corporations to create job opportunities, mentorship programs, and other initiatives that support economic growth within Native American communities.
5. Address systemic barriers: Advocate for policies that address systemic barriers to economic success, such as inadequate infrastructure, limited access to capital, and discrimination.
6. Provide financial literacy programs: Offer financial literacy programs to help individuals understand basic financial concepts, create budgets, and make informed financial decisions.
7. Encourage cultural preservation: Support initiatives that promote the preservation of Native American cultures, languages, and traditions, which can also contribute to economic development.
8. Foster innovation: Encourage innovation and entrepreneurship within Native American communities by providing resources for research and development, and supporting start-ups.
9. Build sustainable infrastructure: Invest in sustainable infrastructure projects that support economic growth, such as renewable energy initiatives, transportation systems, and community facilities.
10. Empower local governments: Provide support and resources to local Native American governments to help them develop economic development strategies tailored to their communities' unique needs and opportunities.
