Supporting the health and well-being of Native American communities during the third trimester of pregnancy requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique cultural, social, and economic factors affecting these communities. Here are some effective strategies for supporting Native natural-born US communities during this critical period:

1. Culturally safe and respectful care: Ensure that healthcare providers are trained in cultural safety and humility, recognizing the historical trauma and ongoing discrimination faced by Native American communities. This includes understanding the importance of traditional healing practices and ceremonies in pregnancy and childbirth.
2. Community-based care: Involve local tribal leaders, elders, and community members in the healthcare delivery process. This can include setting up birthing centers or clinics within Native American communities, training traditional healers to work alongside medical providers, and incorporating traditional practices and rituals into prenatal and postnatal care.
3. Addressing social determinants of health: Many Native American communities face significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to factors such as poverty, poor infrastructure, and lack of access to healthy food and clean water. Strategies for addressing these social determinants of health include investing in community development projects, improving access to nutritious food and clean water, and providing economic support for families.

This can include developing culturally appropriate educational materials, providing translation services, and engaging in community outreach and engagement activities.

This can include partnering with tribal health departments, hospitals, and clinics to provide comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care that reflects the unique needs and beliefs of Native American
