Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent to the US bereaved individuals in education requires a culturally sensitive and trauma-informed approach. Here are some strategies that educators and administrators can use to support these students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Incorporate traditional teachings, stories, and cultural practices into the curriculum to help Native American students feel seen and connected to their heritage.
2. Trauma-informed care: Provide training on trauma and its effects on students' learning and well-being. Use this knowledge to create a safe and supportive learning environment that acknowledges and validates the experiences of Native American students.
3. Community partnerships: Collaborate with local Native American communities and organizations to provide opportunities for students to engage in cultural practices, learn from elders, and participate in community service projects.
4. Identity-based programming: Develop programs that promote Native American identity and culture, such as language classes, traditional dance and music instruction, and cultural events.
5. Inclusive curriculum: Infuse Native American history, culture, and perspectives into the curriculum to provide a more accurate and inclusive understanding of US history and society.
6. Restorative justice practices: Implement restorative justice practices that prioritize healing and reconciliation over punishment and retribution. This can help address intergenerational trauma and promote healing and well-being for Native American students.
7. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide ongoing cultural sensitivity training for educators to help them understand the unique needs and experiences of Native American students.
8. Student voice and choice: Incorporate student voice and choice into the learning process to help students feel invested in their education and more likely to succeed.
9. Family engagement: Engage with Native American families through regular communication, community events, and opportunities for parents to participate in educational activities.
10. Tribal consultation: Consult with local Native American tribes and communities on educational initiatives and policies to ensure they are culturally responsive and respectful of tribal sovereignty.
