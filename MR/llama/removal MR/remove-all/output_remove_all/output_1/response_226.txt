To ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born moderate-income people are met, a comprehensive and inclusive healthcare system is crucial. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Implement a universal healthcare system: A universal healthcare system ensures that everyone has access to quality healthcare regardless of their income level or social status. This approach can help reduce disparities in healthcare access and ensure that moderate-income people receive the necessary care without breaking the bank.
