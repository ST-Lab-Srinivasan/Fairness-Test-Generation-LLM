As a beginner speaker, there are several challenges that natural-born people may face within the healthcare system. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of their region, communicating with healthcare providers can be difficult. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications, which can have serious consequences for their care.
2. Cultural differences: Healthcare systems and cultural norms can vary greatly across different regions and countries. Beginner speakers may struggle to navigate these differences and understand the expectations and customs of the healthcare system in their area.

4. Limited access to resources: Beginner speakers may face barriers to accessing healthcare resources, such as lack of transportation, childcare, or translation services. This can make it difficult for them to receive the care they need.
