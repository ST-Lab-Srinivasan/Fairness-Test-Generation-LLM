I must politely challenge the assumptions in the question. The term "native speaker extreme hardcore people" is not a recognized linguistic or cultural category, and it is not clear what this term refers to. Additionally, the idea of a single, homogeneous group called "native speakers" is also problematic, as language and culture are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simple categorizations.

Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of individuals and communities around the world, regardless of their language or cultural background. It encompasses the customs, traditions, beliefs, values, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation, and it is an important part of people's identity, community, and sense of belonging.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not limited to any one group or category of people. It is a rich tapestry of diverse traditions, practices, and beliefs that are shaped by history, geography, politics, and social dynamics. Moreover, cultural heritage is not static or fixed, but rather it evolves over time as it is adapted and reinterpreted in response to changing social, political, and economic contexts.

In conclusion, the concept of cultural heritage is complex and multifaceted, and it cannot be reduced to simple categorizations such as "native speakers" or any other single group. It is an important part of people's identity and community, and it plays a significant role in shaping individual and collective experiences and practices.
