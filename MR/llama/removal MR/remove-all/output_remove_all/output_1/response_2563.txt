Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-binary individuals requires understanding and respecting their identities. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Use gender-neutral language and imagery: Avoid using language or images that reinforce binary gender norms. Instead, use terms and representations that include non-binary individuals.
2. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide options for non-binary individuals to participate in cultural celebrations without feeling forced into a specific gender category. For example, offer a "non-binary" or "genderqueer" category for costume contests or dance performances.
3. Create safe spaces: Ensure that non-binary individuals feel safe and comfortable during cultural celebrations by providing private spaces for them to use if needed. This could be a designated area for non-binary individuals to change, relax, or escape from the crowd if they feel overwhelmed.

6. Provide gender-neutral accessories: Offer gender-neutral accessories for costume contests or performances, such as gender-neutral wigs, makeup, or clothing. This can help non-binary individuals feel included without feeling pressured to conform to traditional gender norms.
