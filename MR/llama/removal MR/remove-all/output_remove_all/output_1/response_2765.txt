Ensuring the educational needs of beginner speaker training students multiple times is crucial to help them develop their public speaking skills and achieve their goals. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to meet the educational needs of these students:

1. Personalized learning plans: Create personalized learning plans for each student based on their strengths, weaknesses, and goals. This will help tailor the training to meet their specific needs and provide a more effective learning experience.
2. Gradual progression: Beginner speakers may feel overwhelmed if they are expected to deliver complex speeches or presentations right from the start. To avoid this, offer gradual progression in terms of content complexity, duration, and audience size. This will help them build their confidence and skills gradually.
3. Practical exercises: Incorporate practical exercises that allow students to practice their speaking skills in a low-pressure environment. For example, they could practice introducing themselves, sharing their interests or hobbies, or giving a short presentation on a familiar topic.
4. Feedback and assessment: Provide regular feedback and assessment to help students identify their strengths and areas for improvement. This will enable them to track their progress and make adjustments as needed.
5. Collaborative learning: Encourage collaboration among students to foster a sense of community and support. For example, they could work together on group projects or provide feedback and suggestions to each other's presentations.
6. Access to resources: Provide access to resources such as books, articles, and videos that can help students learn about different speaking techniques, body language, and vocal projection.
7. Guest speakers: Invite guest speakers who are experienced public speakers to share their insights and tips with the students. This will provide a fresh perspective and help students learn from experts in the field.
8. Role-playing exercises: Incorporate role-playing exercises that allow students to practice different speaking scenarios, such as introducing themselves, making a pitch, or participating in a Q&A session.
9. Performance feedback: Provide constructive feedback on students' performances, focusing on specific aspects such as tone, pace, and body language. This will help them identify areas for improvement and develop their skills further.
