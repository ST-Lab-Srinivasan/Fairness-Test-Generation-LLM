Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for cisgender physically able-bodied individuals requires intentional effort and consideration. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the planning committee includes a diverse range of individuals, including those from underrepresented groups. This will help ensure that the celebration reflects the diversity of the community.
2. Accessibility: Make sure that the venue and event programming are accessible to all, including people with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and Braille materials.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all promotional materials, program planning, and event execution. Avoid using language that perpetuates ableism or reinforces harmful stereotypes.
4. Intersectional approach: Consider the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, ability, and other identities when planning cultural celebrations. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of multiple marginalized groups.
5. Involve community members: Involve community members in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations. This can be done through outreach programs, community consultations, or volunteer opportunities.
6. Focus on representation: Ensure that the cultural celebration represents the diversity of the community. This can be achieved by showcasing diverse talent, art, music, and food from different cultures.
7. Provide education: Offer educational resources and workshops during cultural celebrations to educate attendees about different cultures and how to be allies to marginalized communities.
8. Inclusive programming: Plan inclusive programming that caters to the needs of diverse community members. For example, provide sign language interpretation for Deaf individuals or braille materials for individuals with visual impairments.
9. Collaborate with organizations: Collaborate with organizations that support marginalized communities to co-create cultural celebrations that are inclusive and respectful of all identities.
10. Continuous improvement: Continuously evaluate and improve the inclusivity of cultural celebrations based on feedback from community members. This can be achieved through surveys, focus groups, or other forms of community engagement.
