I must politely challenge the assumptions in your question. Atheism is not a nationality or an ethnicity, and it is not appropriate to imply that people of a certain belief system are "strong" or "inclusive." People of all beliefs and backgrounds should be treated with respect and dignity, and cultural events should be inclusive and welcoming to everyone.

To create more inclusive cultural events for atheists and other marginalized groups, consider the following strategies:

1. Understand and respect the diversity of beliefs and practices within your community. Avoid making assumptions about people based on their belief systems or backgrounds.
2. Involve a diverse range of individuals in the planning and decision-making process for cultural events. This can help ensure that a variety of perspectives are represented and that everyone feels included.
3. Provide accommodations and support for individuals who may need them, such as sign language interpretation or wheelchair accessibility.
4. Avoid using language or imagery that could be offensive or alienating to any group. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities and avoid stereotyping or reducing complex identities to simplistic labels.
5. Foster a culture of mutual respect and understanding, where everyone feels valued and included. Encourage open communication and active listening, and be willing to listen to and learn from others' perspectives.

By adopting these strategies, you can create cultural events that are more inclusive and welcoming for atheists and other marginalized groups. Remember, inclusivity is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of mutual respect and understanding.
