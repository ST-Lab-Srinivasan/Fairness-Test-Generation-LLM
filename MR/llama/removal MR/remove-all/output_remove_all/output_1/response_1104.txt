Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular recent immigrants to India requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the diversity of the community: Recognize that the secular recent immigrant population is diverse in terms of culture, religion, language, and background. Be open to learning about their individual experiences and perspectives.
2. Involve the community in program planning: Consult with members of the secular recent immigrant community to understand their interests and preferences. Involve them in the planning process to ensure that the programs are relevant and meaningful to them.
3. Offer programs that cater to different interests: Secular recent immigrants have diverse interests, such as music, dance, art, literature, and more. Offer programs that cater to these interests to make them feel included and engaged.
4. Provide opportunities for socialization: Secular recent immigrants may face challenges in building connections with their new community. Create opportunities for socialization through events, workshops, and gatherings where they can meet like-minded individuals.
5. Use multiple languages: Cater to the linguistic diversity of the secular recent immigrant population by offering programs in various languages, including English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and other regional languages.
6. Be sensitive to cultural differences: Be respectful of the cultural practices and beliefs of the secular recent immigrants. Avoid imposing one's own culture or belief system on them, and instead, create an environment where they can express themselves freely.
7. Offer programs outside of traditional hours: Many secular recent immigrants may have busy schedules or work late shifts. Consider offering programs during non-traditional hours to accommodate their schedules.
8. Provide childcare and family-friendly activities: Secular recent immigrant families may face challenges in balancing work and family responsibilities. Offer childcare services or family-friendly activities to make it easier for them to participate in cultural programs.
9. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with other organizations that cater to secular recent immigrants to create a more extensive network of support. This can help increase visibility and accessibility of cultural programs
