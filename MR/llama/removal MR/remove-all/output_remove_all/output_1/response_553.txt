Addressing the needs of Non-Recently Displaced Individuals (NRD) in disaster response is crucial to ensure that these individuals, who may have been affected by the disaster but are not recent migrants or refugees, receive the support they need. Here are some strategies that can be used to address the needs of NRD individuals:

1. Inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Policies: Governments and other stakeholders should adopt inclusive policies that take into account the specific needs of NRD individuals, including those with disabilities, children, women, and older adults. These policies should aim to reduce the risk of disasters and mitigate their impact on vulnerable populations.
2. Community-Based Approaches: Community-based approaches can help build resilience among NRD individuals by empowering them to take an active role in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. This can involve establishing local networks of volunteers, community groups, and other organizations that can provide support during disasters.

Accessible Information and Communication: Providing accessible information and communication channels is essential for reaching NRD individuals who may not have access to the same resources as other populations.

This can involve providing adaptable housing solutions, accessible bathrooms and sanitation facilities, and ensuring that the physical environment is safe and accessible for all.
5. Capacity Building and Training: Providing training and capacity building opportunities for NRD individuals can help them prepare for disasters and respond effectively when they occur. This can involve teaching basic first aid, search and rescue techniques, and other essential skills that can help individuals protect themselves and their communities during disasters.
6. Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems: Developing multi-hazard early warning systems that take into account the specific needs of NRD individuals can help them prepare for a range of hazards, including those that may be more likely to affect them than other populations. These systems should provide timely and
