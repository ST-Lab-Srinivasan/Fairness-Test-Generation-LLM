Creating more inclusive community events for people with newly diagnosed genetic conditions requires thoughtful planning and execution. Here are some strategies to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Involve the Community: Engage with local organizations that support individuals with genetic conditions, such as patient advocacy groups or medical clinics. These partners can provide valuable insights and resources to make your event more inclusive.
