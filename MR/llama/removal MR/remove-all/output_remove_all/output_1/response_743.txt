Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individualistic people in various ways. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal and social recognition: Individualistic societies often place great emphasis on legal and social recognition, such as citizenship rights, access to education and healthcare, and social welfare benefits.
