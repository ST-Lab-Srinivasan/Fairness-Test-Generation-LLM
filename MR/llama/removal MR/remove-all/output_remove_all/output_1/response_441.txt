Creating more inclusive community events for native speaker elite people requires careful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies you can use to make your events more inclusive:

1. Use clear and simple language: Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-native speakers. Instead, use plain language that is easy to understand for everyone.
2. Provide interpreters or translators: If you are hosting a large event with many attendees who are native speakers of different languages, consider hiring interpreters or translators to help facilitate communication between them and the other attendees.
3. Offer multilingual materials: Make sure that all event materials, including flyers, programs, and signs, are available in multiple languages. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and informed.
4. Create a welcoming atmosphere: Make sure that your event has a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. This can be done by having a diverse team of organizers and volunteers, and by promoting the event through social media and other channels to reach a wider audience.
5. Encourage participation from all attendees: Plan activities and events that encourage participation from all attendees, regardless of their language proficiency. This can include group discussions, brainstorming sessions, or other interactive activities.
6. Use visual aids: Using visual aids such as pictures, videos, or diagrams can help to communicate information in a way that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their language proficiency.
7. Provide language support: Offer language support services such as language classes or tutoring before the event to help attendees improve their language skills.
8. Be mindful of cultural differences: Be sensitive to the cultural differences and backgrounds of your attendees, and plan activities that are respectful and inclusive of all cultures.
9. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations such as seating areas or quiet spaces for attendees who may need them due to language barriers or other factors.
10. Evaluate and improve: After the event, evaluate what worked well and what could be improved. Use this information to make adjustments for future events to ensure they are even more inclusive and accessible for
