Supporting recently expecting ethnic minority communities can be crucial in ensuring they receive the necessary care and support during this critical period. Here are some effective strategies that healthcare providers, community organizations, and individuals can adopt to support these communities:

1. Culturally Competent Care: Provide culturally competent care by understanding the unique cultural beliefs, practices, and values of the ethnic minority community.
