Creating more inclusive recreational activities for individuals who are not deeply in poverty can be achieved through a variety of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local non-profits, community centers, and other organizations that serve diverse populations to offer recreational activities. These partnerships can help reach a broader audience and provide access to those who may not have the means to participate otherwise.
2. Offer financial assistance: Provide financial aid or scholarships to individuals who cannot afford participation fees. This can include subsidies, grants, or other forms of financial support.
3. Adaptive sports programs: Develop adaptive sports programs for individuals with disabilities or mobility issues. These programs can provide opportunities for individuals to participate in recreational activities despite their physical limitations.
4. Inclusive programming: Offer recreational activities that are inclusive of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds. For example, community centers could offer programs that cater to seniors, youth, or individuals with disabilities.
5. Outreach and marketing: Utilize outreach and marketing strategies to promote recreational activities to under-resourced communities. This can include targeted advertising, community outreach events, and partnerships with local schools and organizations.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for individuals to participate in recreational activities and help provide access to those who may not be able to afford it.
7. Government funding: Utilize government funding sources, such as the National Park Service or the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to support recreational programs in underserved communities.
8. Community-led initiatives: Encourage community members to take ownership of recreational activities by leading initiatives and providing access to under-resourced populations.
9. Mobile recreation: Utilize mobile recreational facilities, such as buses or trailers, to bring recreational activities directly to underserved communities.
10. Advocacy: Advocate for policies that support inclusive recreational opportunities, such as funding for community recreation centers or programs that prioritize accessibility and affordability.
11. Partnerships with local businesses: Partner with local businesses
