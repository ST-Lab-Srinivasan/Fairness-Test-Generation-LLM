As the world becomes increasingly fluid and temporary, it's essential to rethink traditional social policies to accommodate the needs of lifelong recently temporary individuals. Here are some ways to create more inclusive social policies for this growing demographic:

1. Recognize and validate their identity: Acknowledge that temporality is a legitimate aspect of human experience and provide support for individuals who identify as lifelong recently temporary. This can involve recognizing and validating their identities, rather than trying to fit them into fixed categories.
2. Offer flexible benefits and services: Design benefits and services that are flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. For example, provide portable health insurance that follows individuals as they transition between temporary roles or locations.
3. Encourage intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for lifelong recently temporary individuals to connect with younger and older people, fostering intergenerational relationships and a sense of community across age groups.
4. Promote access to education and training: Offer flexible, portable educational programs that can be pursued in various contexts throughout an individual's life. This can help lifelong recently temporary individuals acquire new skills and knowledge without being tied to a specific location or time frame.
5. Support mental health and well-being: Recognize the unique challenges faced by lifelong recently temporary individuals, such as the constant need to adapt and navigate uncertain environments. Provide mental health resources and support networks to help them manage stress and maintain their well-being.
6. Foster inclusive communities: Create welcoming spaces that accommodate the diverse needs of lifelong recently temporary individuals. This can involve designing public spaces, housing options, and community programs that are flexible and adaptable to different life stages and circumstances.
7. Encourage entrepreneurship and innovation: Support the development of innovative products, services, and business models that cater to the needs of lifelong recently temporary individuals. This can involve providing resources and mentorship for startups and small businesses that prioritize flexibility and adaptability.
8. Advocate for policy changes: Work with policymakers to create laws and regulations that acknowledge and support the rights of lifelong recently temporary individuals. This can involve advocating for portable benefits, flexible work arrangements, and other policies
