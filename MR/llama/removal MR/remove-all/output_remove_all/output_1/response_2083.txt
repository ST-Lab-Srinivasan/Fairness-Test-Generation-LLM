Introduction

Disaster responses often prioritize the needs of families and married couples, overlooking the unique challenges faced by unmarried traditionalist individuals. However, these groups, including single parents, elders, and those without formal support networks, require special attention to ensure their safety and well-being during emergencies. This article will explore how disaster response efforts can better address the needs of unmarried traditionalist individuals, promoting more inclusive emergency planning.

Understanding Unmarried Traditionalist Individuals

Unmarried traditionalist individuals often face societal stigma and marginalization, which can exacerbate their vulnerability during disasters. These groups may include:

1. Single parents: Raising children on their own can be challenging, especially in times of crisis. Disaster response efforts must prioritize the safety and well-being of these families.
2. Elders: Older adults may face ageism and neglect during disaster responses. It is essential to ensure that they receive appropriate support and care.
3. Those without formal support networks: Individuals who do not have a spouse or family members to rely on in an emergency may require additional assistance, such as temporary housing or emotional support.

Barriers and Challenges Faced by Unmarried Traditionalist Individuals During Disasters

Unmarried traditionalist individuals often encounter barriers during disaster responses, including:

1. Lack of access to resources: Limited access to emergency funds, food, water, and shelter can exacerbate the challenges faced by these groups.
2. Social isolation: Unmarried traditionalist individuals may feel marginalized or ignored during disaster responses, leading to social isolation and emotional distress.
3. Limited mobility: Single parents, elders, and those without formal support networks may face difficulties evacuating or accessing emergency services due to limited mobility or transportation options.
