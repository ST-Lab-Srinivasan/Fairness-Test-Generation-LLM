Creating more inclusive cultural programs for monasteries can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Understand the needs and interests of the community: Conduct research and gather input from the monastic community to understand their cultural background, interests, and preferences. This will help you create programs that are relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Involve the community in the planning process: Encourage active participation from the monastic community in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. This can be done through consultations, focus groups, or other forms of collaboration.
3. Provide accessible and affordable programming: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to everyone in the monastic community, regardless of their economic status. Offer a range of programs at different price points to make them more inclusive.
4. Showcase diverse perspectives: Incorporate diverse cultures, religions, and traditions into your cultural programs. This can be done by inviting artists, performers, or speakers from different backgrounds to share their experiences and knowledge with the community.
5. Create intergenerational opportunities: Involve people of all ages in cultural programs to create opportunities for intergenerational learning and connection. This can include hosting events that bring together people of different generations, such as workshops, performances, or lectures.
6. Provide translation and interpretation services: Offer translation and interpretation services during cultural programs to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the content being presented.
7. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are physically accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair access, sign language interpretation, or other accommodations as needed.
8. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Create opportunities for monastics and laypeople to engage in dialogue and learn from each other's cultures. This can be done through cultural exchange programs, workshops, or other forms of collaboration.
9. Be inclusive of marginalized groups: Ensure that cultural programs are inclusive of marginalized groups within the monastic community, such as those who identify as LGBTQ+, people of color, or individuals with mental or physical disabilities.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the effectiveness of your cultural programs and make adjustments as
