Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for cisgender infants is important to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their gender identity, feel welcome and included in these events. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Use inclusive language: Avoid using binary language (i.e., "boys" or "girls") and instead use language that is inclusive of all gender identities (e.g., "everyone," "all ages," or "the whole community").
2. Be mindful of costumes and dress code: Encourage participants to dress in a way that makes them feel comfortable and confident, without reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes. For example, avoid requiring boys to wear superhero costumes or girls to wear princess dresses.
3. Incorporate diverse representation: Make sure that the cultural celebration includes diverse representation of individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This can be achieved by incorporating music, dance, art, and other forms of expression that reflect the diversity of the community.
4. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that there are gender-neutral bathrooms or family restrooms available for participants who may not identify with traditional gender categories.
5. Involve marginalized communities in the planning process: Make sure that the cultural celebration is planned and organized by individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who have been historically marginalized or excluded. This can help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of all voices and perspectives.
6. Offer gender-neutral roles and activities: Provide opportunities for individuals of all genders to participate in leadership roles, performances, or other activities. For example, allow anyone to lead a dance or play a musical instrument, regardless of their gender identity.
7. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural celebration is a safe and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can be achieved by providing a clear policy on harassment and discrimination, and having staff and volunteers who are trained to provide support and address any incidents that may arise.
8. Incorporate education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that promote understanding and acceptance of diverse gender ident
