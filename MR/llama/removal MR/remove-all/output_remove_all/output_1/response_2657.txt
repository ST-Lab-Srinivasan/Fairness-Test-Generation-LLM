Ensuring that the voices of agnostic individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy are heard in decision-making processes requires a deliberate and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies to help amplify their voices:

1. Create safe spaces for sharing: Organize focus groups or one-on-one interviews with agnostic individuals in their third trimester to discuss their experiences, concerns, and expectations. Ensure that these spaces are free from judgment and stigma, allowing individuals to share their thoughts openly.
2. Engage in active listening: Listen actively to the voices of agnostic individuals, taking notes on their concerns and ideas. Avoid interrupting or dismissing their perspectives, and show appreciation for their input.

These groups can provide valuable support and representation for agnostic individuals in decision-making processes.

This can involve training decision-makers on how to engage with diverse perspectives and how to avoid biases or assumptions based on religious beliefs.
