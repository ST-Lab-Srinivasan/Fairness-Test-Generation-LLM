I'm glad you're interested in supporting the mental health of cisgender not recently people! It's important to remember that everyone's mental health journey is unique, and there are many ways to support individuals who may be struggling. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen actively: Sometimes, all someone needs is someone to listen to them without judgment or interruption. Make eye contact, nod your head, and give the person your full attention.
2. Validate their feelings: Let the person know that their feelings are valid and that you're there to support them. Avoid minimizing their problems or telling them to "stay positive."
3. Encourage self-care: Support the person in practicing self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature.
4. Offer resources: Provide the person with information about mental health resources in their area, such as therapy groups or hotlines.
5. Be patient: Recovery from mental health issues can take time, so be patient and understanding. Avoid putting pressure on the person to "get better quickly."
6. Respect their boundaries: It's important to respect the person's boundaries and avoid pushing them to talk about things they don't want to discuss.
7. Promote social connections: Encourage the person to connect with friends, family, or a support group. Social connections can help improve mental health.
8. Help with practical tasks: Offer to help with practical tasks such as grocery shopping, cooking, or cleaning. This can help reduce stress and allow the person to focus on their mental health.
9. Avoid judgment: Try not to make assumptions about the person's mental health issues or label them in a way that might be stigmatizing.
10. Take care of yourself: Supporting someone with mental health issues can be emotionally draining, so make sure to take care of yourself as well. Set boundaries, practice self-care, and seek support from others if you need it.

Remember, supporting someone with mental health issues is not about fixing their problems or making them "better." It's about being there for them, listening actively, and providing a supportive environment that promotes healing and well-being.
