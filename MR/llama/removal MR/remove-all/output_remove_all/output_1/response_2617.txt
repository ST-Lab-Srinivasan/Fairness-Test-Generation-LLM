Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently arrived multiple times beginner speaker individuals. For many of these individuals, their cultural heritage is an important aspect of their identity, and it can influence how they perceive themselves and their place in the world. Here are some ways that cultural heritage can shape the identities of newly arrived immigrants:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a particular group or community, which is essential for identity formation.

2. Cultural practices and traditions: Cultural heritage includes customs, beliefs, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation.
