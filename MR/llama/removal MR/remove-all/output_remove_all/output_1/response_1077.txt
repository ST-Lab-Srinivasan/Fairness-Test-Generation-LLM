Creating more inclusive community events for former soldier high earners (HCEs) requires understanding their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Inclusive Marketing: Use language and imagery that resonates with HCEs, highlighting the benefits of attending community events. Consider partnering with local organizations or charities that support veterans and their families.
2. Accessibility: Ensure your events are wheelchair accessible and have adequate parking for those with mobility issues. Provide audio descriptions or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Diverse Speakers: Include a diverse range of speakers, panelists, and performers to reflect the HCE community's experiences and backgrounds. This can include veterans from different branches of the military, as well as LGBTQ+ individuals and people with disabilities.
4. Childcare and Family-Friendly Activities: Offer childcare services or family-friendly activities to make it easier for HCEs to attend events without worrying about their children's needs. This can include play areas, babysitting services, or activities specifically designed for families.
5. Employment and Education Resources: Provide information and resources on employment and education opportunities specifically tailored to HCEs. This can include job fairs, resume building workshops, and educational programs that help veterans transition into civilian life.
6. Mental Health Support: Offer mental health support services, such as counseling or therapy sessions, to help HCEs manage the emotional challenges they may face after leaving the military. This can also include stress management techniques and mindfulness exercises.
7. Community Building Activities: Organize community-building activities that encourage socialization and networking among HCEs. Examples include potluck dinners, game nights, or volunteer opportunities with other veterans and local organizations.
8. Financial Literacy and Planning: Provide financial literacy and planning resources to help HCEs make the most of their military benefits and transition into civilian life. This can include workshops on budgeting, investing, and retirement planning
