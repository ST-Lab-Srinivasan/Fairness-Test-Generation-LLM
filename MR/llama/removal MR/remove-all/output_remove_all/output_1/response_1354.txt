The legal system can be complex and challenging for any individual, regardless of their ethnic background. However, native speaker ethnically full people may face additional challenges within the legal system due to issues such as:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system, navigating court procedures and understanding legal terminology can be particularly difficult. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and missed opportunities for justice.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system is often shaped by Western cultural norms and values, which may not align with the cultural practices and beliefs of non-Western communities. This can result in a lack of understanding or empathy from legal professionals, leading to unfair outcomes.
