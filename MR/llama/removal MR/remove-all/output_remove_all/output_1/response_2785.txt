Creating more inclusive social policies for financially disadvantaged ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Acknowledge the issue: The first step is to acknowledge the existence of financial inequality faced by ex-spouses, particularly those who have been economically disadvantaged due to their marital status. This includes recognizing the ways in which societal norms and legal frameworks can perpetuate this inequality.
2. Address legal barriers: Many laws and regulations can create obstacles for financially disadvantaged ex-spouses, such as unequal distribution of assets, limited access to financial resources, and difficulties in obtaining adequate child support. Policymakers must work to address these legal barriers and create more equitable frameworks.
3. Improve financial literacy: Financial literacy is a critical component of economic empowerment. Governments and organizations should provide educational resources and workshops to help ex-spouses better understand personal finance, budgeting, and investing.
4. Encourage entrepreneurship: Ex-spouses who have been economically disadvantaged may benefit from support for starting their own businesses or pursuing alternative income streams. This can include access to funding, mentorship, and training programs.
5. Provide affordable housing options: Many ex-spouses face significant challenges in finding affordable and secure housing, particularly in areas where the cost of living is high. Policymakers should work to create more affordable housing options, such as subsidized rentals or shared ownership models.
6. Offer mental health support: The emotional toll of divorce can be significant, and many ex-spouses may struggle with anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Mental health professionals should be made available to provide support and counseling services.
7. Advocate for fairer division of assets: In many cases, the division of assets following a divorce can be unfairly weighted in favor of the more financially powerful partner. Policymakers should work to create fairer frameworks for asset division, ensuring that both parties have access to sufficient financial resources.
