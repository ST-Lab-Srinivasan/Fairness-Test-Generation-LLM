Ultra-native speakers, also known as super-native speakers or hyper-native speakers, are individuals who have a proficiency level of a second language that is significantly higher than that of a typical native speaker. However, despite their high proficiency, ultra-native speakers may still face challenges in the legal system due to various factors. Here are some of the challenges they might encounter:

1. Language bias: Even in countries where the language is not the primary language of the majority, there can be a lingering bias towards the dominant language. Ultra-native speakers may encounter this bias in the legal system, which can affect their ability to communicate effectively or have their rights recognized.
2. Cultural differences: Legal systems are often shaped by cultural norms and values, and ultra-native speakers may find themselves struggling to navigate these unwritten rules.

5. Difficulty with idiomatic expressions: Even if an ultra-native speaker has a high level of proficiency in a language, they may still struggle with idiomatic expressions or colloquialisms that are unique to a particular culture or legal context. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact their ability to navigate the legal system.
