Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who are undocumented or have precarious immigration status. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during pregnancy, including language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, and fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Fear of reporting symptoms: Due to fear of immigration authorities, individuals with precarious immigration status may be less likely to report symptoms or seek medical attention during pregnancy, which can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.
3. Limited access to social services: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges when accessing social services such as food assistance programs, housing support, and financial aid. This can exacerbate existing health disparities and limit the ability of pregnant individuals to access essential resources during pregnancy.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Immigration status can contribute to stigma and discrimination experienced by pregnant individuals, particularly those who are undocumented. This can lead to feelings of isolation, shame, and embarrassment, which can negatively impact mental health and well-being.
5. Detention and deportation: In some cases, immigration authorities may detain or deport individuals during pregnancy, which can have severe consequences for both the mother and the baby.
6. Lack of legal rights: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges when seeking legal recourse to protect their rights during pregnancy, including access to abortion care. This can limit their ability to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and well-being.
7. Limited economic opportunities: Pregnant individuals with precarious immigration status may face challenges when seeking employment or accessing financial support during pregnancy, which can limit their ability to meet their basic needs and provide for their families.
8. Separation from support networks: Immigration status can lead to separation from support networks, including family and friends, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation
