As a Nigerian, turning 65 can be a significant milestone, but it also comes with its own set of challenges, particularly in the healthcare system. Here are some of the challenges that elderly Nigerians may face:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Many parts of Nigeria have limited access to healthcare facilities, especially in rural areas. This can make it difficult for the elderly to receive proper medical care, especially for chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.
2. Cost of healthcare: Healthcare in Nigeria can be expensive, and many elderly people may struggle to afford the costs of medical treatment, especially if they are living on a fixed income.
3. Limited awareness of aged-related diseases: Many elderly Nigerians may not be aware of the signs and symptoms of age-related diseases, such as dementia, Alzheimer's, and other cognitive decline. This can make it difficult to identify and address these conditions early on.
4. Limited access to specialized care: Specialized care for elderly patients, such as geriatric care, may not be widely available in Nigeria. This can result in a lack of access to appropriate medical care for elderly patients with complex health needs.
5. Cultural and social challenges: In some Nigerian cultures, elderly people may face discrimination and marginalization, which can affect their mental and emotional well-being.
6. Limited support from family and caregivers: Many elderly Nigerians may not have access to adequate support from family members or caregivers, which can make it difficult for them to manage their health and daily living tasks.
7. Limited availability of homecare services: Homecare services, such as personal care and homemaking, may not be widely available in Nigeria, particularly in rural areas. This can make it difficult for elderly people to receive the support they need to live independently.

9. Limited availability of assistive devices: Assistive devices, such as walking aids and wheelchairs,
