Addressing the needs of multiple times soft individuals in disaster response is crucial to ensure that these individuals, who may have experienced trauma or have ongoing mental health needs, receive the appropriate support and care during and after a disaster. Here are some ways to address the needs of multiple times soft individuals:

1. Trauma-informed approach: Ensure that all disaster response efforts are informed by a trauma-informed approach. This means recognizing the potential impacts of trauma on individuals and communities, and taking steps to mitigate those impacts. Provide training for responders on how to recognize and respond to the needs of trauma survivors.
2. Mental health support: Provide access to mental health support services, such as counseling and therapy, for individuals who have experienced trauma or are struggling with ongoing mental health needs. Ensure that these services are culturally responsive and accessible to all individuals, including those from marginalized communities.
3. Community-based care: Provide community-based care and support services, such as peer support groups and home visits, for individuals who may have difficulty accessing traditional medical or mental health services. These services can help build social connections and provide emotional support during a time of crisis.
4. Inclusive communication: Ensure that disaster response efforts are inclusive and accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities, limited English proficiency, or other marginalized populations. Provide alternative formats for information and communication, such as Braille, large print, or audio messaging, to reach individuals with different access needs.
5. Intersectional approach: Take an intersectional approach to addressing the needs of multiple times soft individuals by considering the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other factors that may impact an individual's experience of trauma and disaster response. This can help ensure that services are tailored to meet the unique needs of each individual or community.
6. Building resilience: Foster resilience within communities by providing opportunities for individuals to build skills and connections that can help them navigate future disasters. This can include training on emergency preparedness, first aid, and other critical survival skills, as well as building social connections and networks of support.
7. Advocacy and policy changes:
