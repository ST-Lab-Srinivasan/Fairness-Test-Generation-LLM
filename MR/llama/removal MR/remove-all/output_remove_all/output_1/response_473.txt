Ensuring the educational needs of non-native Mandarin speakers, also known as "newly" or "late" learners, is a crucial aspect of language instruction. Here are some strategies to meet their needs:

1. Adaptive teaching methods: Design curricula and teaching methods that cater to the individual needs of each student, taking into account their prior knowledge, learning style, and proficiency level.
2. Modified language courses: Offer modified language courses for newly arrived students, tailoring the content, pace, and assessments to their needs. This could involve providing more basic-level courses or offering support classes for those who need extra help.
