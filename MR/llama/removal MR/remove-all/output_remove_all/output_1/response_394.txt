Parent Engagement: Involve parents in their children's education by providing opportunities for them to participate in school activities, attend parent-teacher conferences, and receive regular updates on their child's progress. Encourage parents to share their cultural practices and values with the school community to promote mutual understanding and respect.
7. Community Partnerships: Foster partnerships with local community organizations, non-profits, and government agencies that can provide additional resources and support for recently arrived students. These partnerships can help address issues such as food insecurity, housing instability, and mental health concerns that may impact students' ability to succeed academically.
8. Flexible Learning Environments: Create flexible learning environments that can accommodate different learning styles and needs. Provide access to technology, adaptive equipment
