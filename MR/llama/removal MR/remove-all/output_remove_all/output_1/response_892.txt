Introduction:
Marriage is an important life event that can have significant social, emotional, and economic implications. When an individual becomes pregnant in their first trimester, it can add another layer of complexity to their marital status. In Canada, the impacts of marital status on the lives of individuals experiencing early pregnancy can be diverse and far-reaching. This study aims to examine the effects of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant individuals in their first trimester in Canada.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's mental and physical health, social support networks, and economic well-being. For example, married individuals tend to have better mental health outcomes than unmarried individuals, possibly due to the social support and emotional intimacy provided by marriage (1). Similarly, unmarried individuals may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly in the early stages of pregnancy (2).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 100 recently pregnant individuals in their first trimester who are married or unmarried and residing in Canada. Participants will be recruited through obstetrician-gynecologist clinics, prenatal classes, and online forums. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to collect qualitative data on participants' experiences of early pregnancy, including their emotional states, social support networks, and access to healthcare services. Quantitative data will be collected through a self-administered questionnaire that assesses demographic information, mental health outcomes, social support networks, and economic well-being.

Expected Outcomes:
This study aims to provide insight into the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant individuals in their first trimester in Canada. Specifically, we expect to find that married individuals will experience better mental health outcomes and greater social support networks compared to unmarried individuals. We also expect to find that unmarried individuals may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly those related to early pregnancy.

Conclusion:
The impacts of marital status on
