The concept of "infant non-individuals" is not a commonly used term in economics or any other field. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their age or capacity, have inherent value and deserving of dignity and respect. Therefore, I must challenge the assumption that there are such things as "infant non-individuals" who require economic empowerment.

However, I understand the broader context of your question, which appears to be focused on supporting the economic well-being of marginalized or disadvantaged groups, including children and infants. Here are some ways in which we can support their economic empowerment:

1. Education and skill development: Providing access to quality education and skill development opportunities can help individuals, including children and infants, acquire the knowledge and abilities necessary for economic participation. This can include early childhood education programs, vocational training, and apprenticeships.
2. Access to healthcare and nutrition: Ensuring that all individuals have access to basic healthcare services and nutritious food can help them lead healthy lives and reach their full potential. This is particularly important for children and infants, as their physical and cognitive development is critical for their future economic success.
3. Social safety nets: Implementing and maintaining effective social safety nets, such as cash transfers, food assistance programs, and housing support, can help individuals, including children and infants, overcome financial challenges and improve their overall well-being.
4. Microfinance initiatives: Providing microfinance opportunities to disadvantaged groups, including children and infants, can help them start or grow their own businesses, thereby promoting economic empowerment.
5. Child labor prevention: Efforts to prevent child labor and ensure that children are in school rather than working can help promote their educational and economic development. This can involve addressing issues such as poverty, social inequality, and lack of access to education.
6. Support for women's economic empowerment: Women are often the primary caregivers for infants and young children, and supporting their economic empowerment can have positive effects on the entire family. This can involve providing access to training and credit, as well as promoting gender equality in the workplace.
