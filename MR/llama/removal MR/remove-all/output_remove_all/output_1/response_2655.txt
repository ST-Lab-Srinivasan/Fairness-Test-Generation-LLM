Ensuring that the educational needs of radically marginalized students, including those who identify as hardcore, are met requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to understand and appreciate the cultural backgrounds of their students, including those from hardcore subcultures. This includes being aware of the social, historical, and political contexts that shape their identities.
2. Inclusive curriculum design: Develop a curriculum that actively addresses the experiences and perspectives of radically marginalized students.
