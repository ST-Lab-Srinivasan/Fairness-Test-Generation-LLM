Creating more inclusive social policies for low-income individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and inequality. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase the minimum wage: Raising the minimum wage can help ensure that low-income workers earn a living wage and reduce the number of people living in poverty.
