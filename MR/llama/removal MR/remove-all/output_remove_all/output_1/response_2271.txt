Mexican immigrants have faced significant challenges and discrimination in the United States, leading to a long history of advocacy and activism to protect their rights. Here are some examples of successful advocacy efforts:

1. The passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act: This landmark legislation abolished the quota system based on national origin and ethnicity, opening the doors to immigration for Mexicans and other non-European immigrants.
2. The creation of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF): Established in 1968, MALDEF is a national organization that advocates for the civil rights of Latinos through litigation, advocacy, and community organizing.
3. The passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986: This legislation provided amnesty to millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States, including many Mexicans. While the law was criticized for its lack of comprehensive reform, it did provide a pathway to legal status for some undocumented immigrants.
4. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plyler v. Doe (1982): In this decision, the Supreme Court held that undocumented immigrant children living in the United States had the right to attend public school, regardless of their immigration status. This decision helped to establish the principle of equal access to education for all children, regardless of immigration status.
5. The passage of the DREAM Act (2001 and 2010): The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act aimed to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrant youth who were brought to the United States as minors. While the legislation has been reintroduced multiple times without passing, it has helped to raise awareness about the challenges faced by undocumented immigrant youth and push for more comprehensive immigration reform.
6. The creation of the National Immigration Law Center (NILC): Established in 1979, NILC is a non-profit organization that advocates for immigration policies that promote justice, equity, and human rights. They
