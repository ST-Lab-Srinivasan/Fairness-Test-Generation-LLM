Creating more inclusive community events for civilian populations living in poverty requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that organizations and individuals can consider to make their events more accessible and inclusive:

1. Conduct a needs assessment: Before planning any event, it's essential to understand the needs of the target population. Conducting a needs assessment can help identify the specific challenges and barriers faced by people living in poverty, which can inform the design of the event.
2. Accessibility features: Ensure that the event space is accessible for people with disabilities. This includes providing wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Free or low-cost admission: Offer free or low-cost admission to events to make them more accessible to people who may not have the financial means to attend.
4. Childcare and transportation support: Provide childcare and transportation support to ensure that parents can attend events without worrying about finding care for their children or transportation to and from the event location.
5. Language accessibility: Provide language interpretation and translation services to ensure that people who are limited English proficient can participate in events.
6. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and sensitivities when planning events. Incorporate elements of the local culture into the event, such as music, food, and decorations.
7. Outreach and marketing: Use outreach and marketing materials that are tailored to the target population. This can include using language and messaging that is relevant to the community, as well as disseminating information through trusted channels, such as community organizations or religious institutions.
8. Involve community members in planning and decision-making: Involve community members in the planning and decision-making process for events. This can help ensure that the event is responsive to the needs and preferences of the target population.
9. Provide food and refreshments: Offer free or low-cost food and refreshments at events to make them more accessible to people who may not have access to these basic necessities.
10. Follow-up and evaluation: Following an event, conduct an evaluation to assess its impact and identify areas for improvement
