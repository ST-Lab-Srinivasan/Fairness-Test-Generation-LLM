Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for native speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse communities: Make sure that the planning committee for the cultural celebration is representative of the community you are serving. Invite members from various ethnic groups, age groups, and socioeconomic backgrounds to contribute to the celebration's design and execution.
