Addressing the specific needs of ethnically minoritized students who have not had access to quality educational opportunities for a significant portion of their lives requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that educators can use to address the unique needs of these individuals:

1. Culturally Relevant and Responsive Teaching: Ethnically minoritized students benefit from learning experiences that reflect their cultural backgrounds, languages, and experiences.
