Addressing the needs of Non-Recently Displaced Individuals (NRD) in disaster response is crucial to ensure that all affected populations receive adequate support. NRD individuals may include those who have been displaced for a longer period, such as those living in temporary shelters or hosting families, and those who have returned home but face ongoing challenges. Here are some strategies to address the needs of NRD individuals in disaster response:

1. Include them in planning and decision-making processes: NRD individuals should be involved in the planning and decision-making processes related to disaster response and recovery. This can help ensure that their needs and priorities are taken into account and that they are actively engaged in the response efforts.
2. Provide sustainable shelter solutions: NRD individuals may require more durable and sustainable shelter options than those provided to immediate post-disaster needs. Consider providing sustainable building materials, such as recycled or locally sourced materials, to help them rebuild their homes.
3. Support livelihoods and economic recovery: NRD individuals may face challenges in restarting their livelihoods due to the disaster. Provide support for small businesses, entrepreneurship, and job training programs to help them regain their economic stability.
4. Address mental health and well-being needs: The trauma and stress experienced during and after a disaster can have long-lasting effects on NRD individuals' mental health and well-being. Offer mental health services, including counseling and psychotherapy, to help them cope with the trauma and build resilience.
5. Foster community cohesion: Disasters often lead to social isolation and fragmentation of communities. Encourage community-based initiatives that foster social connection, mutual aid, and collective action to promote community resilience and recovery.
6. Provide legal support: NRD individuals may face legal challenges related to property rights, land tenure, and other issues. Offer legal aid services to help them navigate these complex issues and ensure their rights are protected.
7. Address accessibility and inclusion needs: Disasters can exacerbate existing inequalities, particularly for NRD individuals with disabilities or other marginalized groups
