Here are some successful community initiatives led by ethnically full native speakers:

1. Language and Cultural Education Programs: Many ethnically full native speakers have started language and cultural education programs to teach their native language and culture to others. These programs can be conducted in schools, community centers, or online. For example, the "Navajo Language and Culture School" in Arizona provides language and cultural education to Navajo students, while the "Māori Language and Culture Institute" in New Zealand offers courses on the Māori language and culture.
2. Indigenous Land Restoration Projects: Ethnically full native speakers have led initiatives to restore indigenous lands that were previously damaged or destroyed. For example, the "Tlingit Nation's Land Repatriation Project" in Alaska aims to repatriate ancestral lands to the Tlingit people, while the "Yuchi Nation's Land Restoration Project" in Oklahoma seeks to restore Yuchi ancestral lands and cultural sites.
3. Community Gardens: Many ethnically full native speakers have started community gardens to promote food sovereignty and cultural preservation. For example, the "Navajo Nation's Community Garden Project" in Arizona provides gardening resources and training to Navajo families, while the "Māori Community Gardens" in New Zealand offers gardening workshops and training to Māori communities.
4. Traditional Arts and Crafts Preservation: Ethnically full native speakers have worked to preserve traditional arts and crafts practices by teaching younger generations and promoting their work through exhibitions and sales. For example, the "Tlingit Traditional Arts Program" in Alaska provides training and mentorship in Tlingit traditional arts and crafts, while the "Māori Contemporary Crafts" initiative in New Zealand showcases Māori contemporary crafts and provides training and support to Māori artists.
5. Cultural Tourism Development: Ethnically full native speakers have worked to develop cultural tourism programs that promote their culture and heritage to visitors. For example, the "Navajo Nation's Cultural Tourism Program" in Arizona offers guided tours of Navajo cultural sites, while the "Māori Cultural Tours"
