To ensure that the healthcare needs of newly eligible Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Increase funding for Medicare: Providing adequate funding for Medicare is crucial to ensuring that healthcare providers can continue to deliver high-quality care to this growing population.
