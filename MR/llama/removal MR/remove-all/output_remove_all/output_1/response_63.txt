Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for ethnically full devout practicing individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that acknowledges and respects the diverse backgrounds and beliefs of all participants. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand and appreciate the diversity of cultural practices: Recognize that each individual has their own unique cultural practices, beliefs, and values. Be open-minded and willing to learn about these differences, and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's ethnicity or religion.
2. Involve diverse representation in planning and decision-making: Ensure that the planning committee for cultural celebrations includes individuals from a variety of backgrounds, including those who are ethnically full devout practicing. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of all participants.
3. Provide accommodations for diverse dietary needs: Many cultural celebrations involve food, so it's important to consider the dietary needs of all participants. Provide vegetarian or vegan options, as well as gluten-free or halal options when necessary.
4. Offer interpretation services: For individuals who may not speak the dominant language of the culture being celebrated, offer interpretation services during events or celebrations. This can help ensure that everyone has access to the same information and can fully participate in the festivities.
5. Create inclusive programming: Develop programming that reflects the diverse backgrounds and beliefs of all participants. This could include cultural performances, music, or art that represents a variety of ethnicities and religions.
6. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials or workshops that provide an overview of different cultures and beliefs. This can help increase understanding and respect for the diversity of practices and beliefs within the community.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected. Encourage participants to share their cultural practices and traditions, and create opportunities for intercultural dialogue and exchange.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that may exist within the community. Take steps to address these imbalances by giving a platform to marginalized voices and prioritizing their needs and concerns
