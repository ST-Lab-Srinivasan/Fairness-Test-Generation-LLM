Title: Impact of Marital Status on Lives of Pregnant Women in Third Trimester in Mexico

Introduction:
Marriage is a significant social institution that affects various aspects of an individual's life. In Mexico, the marital status of pregnant women in their third trimester can have far-reaching consequences on their physical, emotional, and financial well-being. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant women in their third trimester in Mexico.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect pregnant women's health outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and infant mortality (1,2). Married women tend to have better prenatal care and lower rates of complications during pregnancy compared to unmarried women (3). However, unmarried women may face more challenges in accessing healthcare services due to social stigma and limited access to healthcare resources (4).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. A convenience sample of 100 pregnant women in their third trimester will be recruited from public hospitals in Mexico City. Participants will complete a self-administered questionnaire to collect socio-demographic information, marital status, and perceived social support. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted to gather more in-depth qualitative data on the experiences of pregnant women with different marital statuses.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the limited existing research on the impact of marital status on the lives of pregnant women in Mexico. Findings will provide insights into the challenges faced by unmarried pregnant women and inform potential interventions to improve their access to healthcare services and overall well-being.

Expected Outcomes:
The study will identify differences in prenatal care, social support, and mental health outcomes between married and unmarried pregnant women in Mexico. Specifically, the study will:

1. Examine the relationship between marital status and access to prenatal care.
2. Investigate the impact of mar
