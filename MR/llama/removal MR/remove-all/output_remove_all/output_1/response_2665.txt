Highlighting the issues faced by jobless natural-born individuals can be done through various methods, including:

1. Data visualization: Use interactive visualizations to showcase the distribution of jobs held by natural-born individuals compared to those held by foreign-born individuals. This can help illustrate the discrepancy in job opportunities between the two groups.
2. Infographics: Create infographics that highlight key statistics related to joblessness among natural-born individuals, such as the percentage of natural-born individuals who are unemployed or underemployed.
3. Case studies: Share stories of individual jobless natural-born individuals to illustrate the challenges they face in finding employment. This can help put a human face on the issue and make it more relatable for readers.
4. Survey research: Conduct surveys among jobless natural-born individuals to gather data on their experiences, such as the reasons why they are unemployed, their level of education, and their career aspirations.
5. Economic modeling: Use economic models to simulate the impact of immigration on the labor market and to estimate the potential gains from immigration-driven economic growth.
6. Policy analysis: Analyze existing policies related to immigration and job creation, and evaluate their effectiveness in addressing the issue of joblessness among natural-born individuals.
7. Comparative analysis: Compare the labor market outcomes of natural-born individuals in different countries or regions to identify best practices and potential solutions for improving job opportunities.
8. Historical analysis: Study the historical trends in immigration and job creation to gain insights into how past policies and economic conditions have affected the issue.
9. Experimental research: Design and conduct experiments to test the impact of different interventions, such as job training programs or changes in labor market regulations, on job opportunities for natural-born individuals.
10. Machine learning: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets related to immigration, job creation, and economic growth to identify patterns and trends that can inform policy decisions.

By using these methods, data can be used to highlight the issues faced by jobless natural-born individuals and to identify potential solutions for improving their job opportunities.
