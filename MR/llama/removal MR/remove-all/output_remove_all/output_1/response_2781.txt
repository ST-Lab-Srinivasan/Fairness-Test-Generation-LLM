Meeting the educational needs of beginner speaker students multiple times can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help ensure their success. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide clear instructions and expectations: Make sure to clearly explain the speaking assignment requirements, the topics to be covered, and the expected outcomes. Establish a clear timeline and deadlines for each stage of the process, including the initial brainstorming, drafting, revisions, and final presentation.
2. Offer support and feedback: Provide regular feedback and support throughout the speaking process. Listen to their ideas and concerns, and offer guidance on how to improve their speaking skills. Encourage them to ask questions and seek help when needed.
3. Use various teaching methods: Cater to different learning styles by using a variety of teaching methods, such as lectures, group discussions, role-playing, and multimedia presentations. This will help keep the students engaged and motivated.
4. Provide opportunities for practice: Offer regular opportunities for students to practice their speaking skills, either individually or in groups. This could include class discussions, small group presentations, or one-on-one coaching sessions.
5. Use technology to enhance learning: Utilize technology to provide additional resources and tools to support the students' learning. For example, you can use video conferencing tools for remote speaking practice, or create online resources for students to access at their own pace.
6. Foster a supportive class environment: Create a safe and supportive learning environment where students feel comfortable taking risks and making mistakes. Encourage peer-to-peer feedback and constructive criticism to help students improve their speaking skills.
7. Offer individualized attention: Provide individualized attention and support to each student based on their unique needs and progress. This could include one-on-one coaching sessions, extra time for practice, or additional resources tailored to their specific areas of improvement.
8. Monitor progress consistently: Regularly assess the students' speaking skills and provide feedback on their progress. Use this information to adjust your teaching methods and accommodate their needs accordingly.
9. Encourage self-reflection: Teach the students how to reflect on their own speaking performance, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategies for overcoming challenges.
