Creating more inclusive public spaces for just-turned 65 nominal individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make public spaces more accessible and welcoming for this age group:

1. Accessibility features: Ensure that public spaces have accessibility features such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable individuals with mobility impairments to move around comfortably.
2. Adaptive technologies: Introduce adaptive technologies like audio descriptions, tactile maps, and braille signage to help individuals with visual impairments navigate public spaces more easily.
3. Age-friendly design: Design public spaces with age-related needs in mind. For example, provide comfortable seating areas, adequate lighting, and easy-to-use facilities like water fountains and waste bins.
4. Social connections: Create opportunities for socialization by incorporating communal areas like community gardens, outdoor sculptures, or public art installations that encourage interaction among individuals.
5. Programs and events: Organize age-appropriate programs and events that cater to the interests of just-turned 65 nominal individuals. This could include cultural festivals, educational workshops, or social gatherings.
6. Intergenerational interactions: Encourage intergenerational interactions by creating opportunities for older adults to engage with younger generations. This can be done through mentorship programs, shared community spaces, or co-created activities.
7. Inclusive wayfinding: Develop an inclusive wayfinding system that provides clear directions and information in multiple formats (e.g., audio, visual, tactile) to help individuals navigate public spaces more easily.
8. Partnerships with age-related organizations: Collaborate with organizations that specialize in aging and disability to gain insights into the needs of just-turned 65 nominal individuals and create more inclusive public spaces.
9. Accessible transportation: Ensure that public transportation is accessible and affordable for individuals aged 65 and beyond, with features like wheelchair ramps, priority seating, and audio announcements.
10. Community outreach: Engage with local communities to understand their needs and preferences
