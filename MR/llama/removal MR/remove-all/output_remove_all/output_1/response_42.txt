Protecting the legal rights of non-combatant civilians during times of conflict or war is crucial to ensuring their safety and well-being. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. International Law: Adhere to international humanitarian law and human rights law, which sets out the rights and protections afforded to civilians in conflict situations. These laws prohibit violence against civilians, require parties to a conflict to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, and provide for the protection of civilian infrastructure and property.
2. Domestic Law: Ensure that domestic laws and policies are consistent with international law and provide adequate protections for civilians. This may involve strengthening legal frameworks, increasing resources for enforcement and monitoring, and raising public awareness of civilians' legal rights.
3. Civil Society Engagement: Encourage civil society organizations to play an active role in protecting the legal rights of non-combatant civilians. This can involve working with local communities, documenting human rights abuses, and advocating for policy changes that prioritize civilian protection.
4. Protection Mechanisms: Establish and support protection mechanisms, such as safe zones, shelter centers, and evacuation corridors, to provide a measure of safety for civilians during conflict. These mechanisms can help to reduce the risk of violence and ensure that civilians have access to basic necessities like food, water, and medical care.
5. Access to Justice: Ensure that civilians have access to impartial and independent justice systems, which can provide redress for human rights abuses and other legal wrongs committed against them. This may involve strengthening judicial institutions, providing legal aid services, and promoting accountability mechanisms that hold those responsible for abuses to account.
6. Community-Based Protection: Encourage community-based protection initiatives that empower local communities to protect themselves and their members from violence. This can involve training community members in conflict resolution and peacebuilding techniques, promoting dialogue and reconciliation between conflicting parties, and supporting community-led security initiatives.
7. Child Protection: Ensure that the rights of children are protected during conflicts. This may involve implementing child protection policies and procedures
