Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, not just for ethnic minorities but also for ethnically diverse populations. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for ethnically full people:

1. Better understanding of cultural differences: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers understand the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of their patients, which can lead to better patient outcomes. Ethnically full people may have different expectations and experiences in healthcare settings, and cultural competence can help providers address these differences effectively.
