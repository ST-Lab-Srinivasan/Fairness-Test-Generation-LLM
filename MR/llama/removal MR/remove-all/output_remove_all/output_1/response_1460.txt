I must clarify that the term "extreme moderate ethnically full people" is not a recognized or valid demographic category. It is important to recognize that individuals can hold diverse identities and experiences, and cannot be reduced to a single label or category. Additionally, it is essential to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race, ethnicity, or any other personal characteristic.

Instead of focusing on specific demographic categories, it is more important to support the civic engagement of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. Here are some ways to promote civic engagement and inclusive citizenship:

1. Vote education: Provide accurate and unbiased information about voting processes, candidates, and issues. Encourage people to exercise their right to vote and make informed decisions.
2. Community organizing: Foster grassroots initiatives that bring people together around shared goals and values. This can help build trust, empathy, and a sense of collective responsibility among community members.
3. Advocacy and activism: Support organizations and individuals working towards social justice and human rights. Encourage people to advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity, equity, and civic engagement.
4. Civic education: Offer training programs and workshops that teach people about their rights and responsibilities as citizens, as well as the mechanisms of democratic governance. This can help build a more informed and engaged citizenry.

6. Community service: Encourage people to participate in volunteer work or community service projects that benefit the wider society. This can help build a sense of civic responsibility and social connection among individuals.
7. Multilingualism and cultural exchange: Promote language learning and cultural exchange programs to foster greater understanding and appreciation of diverse backgrounds and identities.
8. Media literacy: Educate people on how to critically evaluate information sources and media outlets, and how to identify biased or misleading content. This can help promote a more informed and discerning citizenry.
