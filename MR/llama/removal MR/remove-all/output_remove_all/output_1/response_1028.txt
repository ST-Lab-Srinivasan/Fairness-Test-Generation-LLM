People who identify as "pregnant" or "recently pregnant" in the third trimester of their pregnancy may face several challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges can include:

1. Limited access to care: People who are recently pregnant, especially those in the third trimester, may face barriers when trying to access prenatal care or other medical services.

This is particularly concerning during the third trimester when potential complications can be more severe and have a greater impact on both the mother and baby.
