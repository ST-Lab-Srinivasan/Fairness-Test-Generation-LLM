Creating more inclusive community events for civilian working-class people requires careful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies that event organizers can use to make their events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Identify and address barriers: Start by identifying the barriers that prevent working-class people from participating in community events. This could include lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited access to affordable tickets. Once you have identified these barriers, develop strategies to address them.
2. Make it accessible: Ensure that your event is easily accessible for people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions. Provide flexible seating arrangements and accommodate different communication needs.
3. Offer affordable tickets: Make sure that the ticket prices are affordable for working-class people. Consider offering discounts for students, seniors, or low-income individuals. You can also offer free tickets to people who cannot afford them.
4. Promote the event: Use multiple channels to promote your event, including social media, flyers, and posters. Reach out to local community groups, schools, and organizations that serve working-class populations.
5. Provide childcare: Offer free or low-cost childcare services during the event to ensure that parents can participate without worrying about their children.
6. Cater to different tastes: Be mindful of the cultural and dietary preferences of your attendees. Offer vegetarian or vegan options, and make sure that there are gluten-free and halal options available.
7. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for attendees to participate in the event by asking them questions, soliciting feedback, and encouraging them to share their thoughts and ideas.
8. Follow up: After the event, follow up with attendees to thank them for participating and to gather feedback. Use this feedback to improve future events and make them more inclusive.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics present in your community and work to create an event that is accessible to marginalized groups. Be intentional about creating a space where everyone feels welcome and valued.
