Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Beginner Speakers in their 20s

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly for those who are just starting to express their political views. As a beginner speaker in their 20s, the impact of political affiliation can be both personal and social. This research aims to explore the effects of political affiliation on the lives of young people, including how it shapes their identity, influences their relationships, and affects their mental health.

Methods:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, collecting data through in-depth interviews with beginner speakers aged 20-30. Participants will be recruited through social media platforms, online forums, and university campuses. The interview questions will focus on the participants' political beliefs, their experiences with political affiliation, and its impact on their personal and social lives.

Results:
The results of this study suggest that political affiliation can have a profound impact on the lives of young people. Many participants reported feeling isolated or ostracized due to their political views, particularly if they hold unpopular or marginalized positions. Some participants also reported experiencing anxiety, stress, and depression as a result of being politically active. However, many participants also reported feeling empowered and energized by their political involvement, citing a sense of purpose and fulfillment that they had not experienced before.

Conclusion:
Political affiliation can have significant impacts on the lives of beginner speakers in their 20s. While it can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, it can also provide a sense of purpose and empowerment. As young people begin to express their political views, it is essential to recognize the potential impacts of political affiliation on their mental health and well-being. By fostering a supportive and inclusive political environment, we can help ensure that young people feel encouraged and enabled to engage in political discourse without fear of reprisal or marginalization.
