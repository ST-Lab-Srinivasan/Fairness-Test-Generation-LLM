As a social scientist studying disaster response and recovery, I believe that it is crucial to recognize the changing demographics of disaster-affected communities, particularly the influx of formerly leftist individuals. These individuals bring unique perspectives and skills that can significantly improve disaster response efforts. Here are some ways to address their needs:
