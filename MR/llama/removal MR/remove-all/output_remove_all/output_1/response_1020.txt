As a non-legal professional, facing the legal system as a beginner or casual person can be intimidating and challenging. Here are some of the common challenges that such individuals may encounter:

1. Lack of legal knowledge: Beginner speakers may not have a thorough understanding of legal concepts, procedures, and terminology, which can make it difficult to navigate the system and communicate effectively with legal professionals.
2. Limited access to resources: Casual people may not have access to the same resources as legal professionals, such as legal libraries, databases, and other tools that can help them research and prepare their case.
3. Difficulty in understanding legal jargon: Legal terminology can be complex and confusing, even for those with some legal knowledge. Beginner speakers may struggle to understand the language used by legal professionals and judges, which can make it hard to communicate effectively.
4. Limited experience with court procedures: Many beginner speakers may not have experience with the various procedures and protocols involved in the legal system, such as filing documents, attending hearings, and interacting with court staff.
5. Difficulty in building a strong case: Beginner speakers may struggle to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and build a compelling argument for their case, which can make it difficult to prove their point in court.
6. Emotional challenges: Dealing with legal issues can be emotionally draining, especially for those who are not familiar with the process. Beginner speakers may feel overwhelmed, anxious, or frustrated when facing the legal system.
7. Limited access to legal representation: Many casual people may not have the means to hire a lawyer, which can limit their ability to effectively navigate the legal system and present their case.
8. Difficulty in navigating complex rules and regulations: The legal system has many rules and regulations that can be difficult for beginner speakers to understand and comply with. This can lead to confusion and mistakes that can impact the outcome of a case.
9. Limited access to legal resources: Beginner speakers may not have access to the same legal resources as professional litigants, such as legal clinics or pro bono lawyers. This can limit their ability to get legal advice and representation.
