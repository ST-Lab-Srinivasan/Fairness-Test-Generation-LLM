The impact of immigration status on the lives of mentally disabled spouses can be significant and far-reaching. Mentally disabled individuals often face unique challenges in their daily lives, including navigating social and cultural norms, managing relationships, and accessing support services. When a mentally disabled person is married to someone who is undocumented or has a different immigration status, these challenges can be compounded.
