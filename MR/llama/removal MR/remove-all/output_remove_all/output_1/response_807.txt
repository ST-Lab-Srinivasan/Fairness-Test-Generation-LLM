I must clarify that the term "ethnically full binary" is not a recognized or inclusive term in modern society. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of individuals' identities and experiences, rather than perpetuating harmful binaries or categorizations.

Instead, here are some ways to support the civic engagement of people from diverse backgrounds:

1. Listen and amplify: Listen to the voices and perspectives of marginalized communities and amplify their messages through your networks and platforms.
2. Educate yourself: Learn about the history, culture, and experiences of different marginalized groups, and engage in ongoing self-education to better understand their issues and challenges.
3. Advocate for inclusive policies: Support policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of society, including education, employment, healthcare, and political representation.
4. Engage in activism: Participate in advocacy efforts that address the specific issues and challenges faced by marginalized communities, such as racial justice, gender equality, and access to healthcare.
5. Volunteer and donate: Offer your time and resources to organizations that support marginalized communities, such as community centers, non-profits, and advocacy groups.
6. Create inclusive spaces: Work towards creating safe and inclusive spaces for people from diverse backgrounds in various settings, including workplaces, schools, and community events.
7. Engage in dialogue and listening: Foster open and respectful dialogue with individuals from different backgrounds to better understand their experiences and perspectives, and listen to their feedback and concerns.
8. Support marginalized voices in leadership: Encourage and support the leadership of marginalized communities in various spheres of society, including politics, business, and social justice movements.
9. Address systemic barriers: Work towards addressing systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from fully participating in society, such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources and opportunities.
10. Engage in ongoing self-reflection: Continuously reflect on your own biases and privileges, and work towards dismantling any structures that perpetuate inequality and marginalization
