To ensure that the educational needs of non-native speakers, also known as "long-time students," are met, here are some strategies that educators and administrators can consider:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for teachers and staff on cultural competence and how to address the unique needs of non-native speaking students. This can help create a more inclusive learning environment.
2. Bilingual or multilingual education: Offer bilingual or multilingual education programs that cater specifically to the needs of non-native speakers. These programs can provide additional support and resources for language development, academic achievement, and social integration.
3. Language support services: Provide language support services such as English language learners (ELL) classes, translation services, or interpreters to help non-native speakers navigate the educational system.
4. Parent involvement: Encourage parental involvement in their child's education by providing opportunities for parents to learn about their child's academic progress and how they can support their child's language development.
5. Partnership with community organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that specialize in serving non-native speaking populations, such as immigrant advocacy groups or language schools, to provide additional resources and support for students.
6. Flexible learning environments: Create flexible learning environments that can accommodate the diverse needs of non-native speakers, such as adaptable seating arrangements, visual aids, and multimedia resources.
7. Technology integration: Utilize technology to support language development and academic achievement, such as online learning platforms, language learning apps, or multimedia resources.
8. Professional development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to enhance their knowledge and skills in teaching non-native speakers, including strategies for effective communication, cultural competence, and language acquisition.
9. Student support services: Offer student support services such as counseling, academic advising, or mental health services to help non-native speakers navigate the challenges of adapting to a new educational system.
10. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policy changes that address the unique needs of non-native speaking students, such as providing additional funding for language support services or creating more inclusive educational policies.
