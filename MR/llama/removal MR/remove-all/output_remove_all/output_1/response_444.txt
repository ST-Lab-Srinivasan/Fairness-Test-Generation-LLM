Natural-born nominals, also known as non-binary individuals, face a range of challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Lack of recognition and protection: In many countries, the legal system does not provide adequate recognition and protection for non-binary individuals. They may not have access to the same rights and benefits as binary gender categories, such as gender-specific identification documents or legal recognition of their gender identity.
2. Inconsistent laws and policies: Laws and policies regarding non-binary identity vary widely across different jurisdictions, leading to inconsistent treatment and potential discrimination. Non-binary individuals may encounter difficulties when dealing with law enforcement agencies, courts, and other legal authorities due to the lack of clarity and consistency in the application of laws.
3. Limited medical recognition: In some countries, non-binary individuals may face barriers when seeking medical recognition of their gender identity. They may be required to undergo gender confirmation surgeries or hormone therapy to obtain legal recognition, which can be harmful and invasive.
4. Discrimination in employment and education: Non-binary individuals may encounter discrimination in the workplace or educational institutions due to their gender identity. They may face harassment, bullying, or unequal treatment based on their gender identity.
5. Lack of representation and support: Non-binary individuals may have limited access to legal resources and support services, such as lawyers who specialize in non-binary issues or advocacy groups that provide assistance with navigating the legal system. This can exacerbate their challenges and make it more difficult for them to access justice.
6. Stigma and social marginalization: Non-binary individuals may face stigma and social marginalization within their communities, which can lead to mental health issues, social isolation, and other negative consequences. This can also affect their ability to access legal resources and support.
7. Identity document challenges: Non-binary individuals may encounter difficulties when trying to obtain identity documents that accurately reflect their gender identity. This can include passports, driver's licenses, and other forms of identification.
8. Child custody and parental rights: Non-binary parents may face discrimination or unequal treatment in child custody disputes,
