I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to refer to individuals as "natural-born" or "upper people." All people are deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances. It's important to recognize that every person has unique experiences and perspectives to bring to the table, and to avoid making assumptions or generalizations based on race, ethnicity, or any other characteristic. Let's focus on promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or hierarchies. Is there anything else I can help with?
