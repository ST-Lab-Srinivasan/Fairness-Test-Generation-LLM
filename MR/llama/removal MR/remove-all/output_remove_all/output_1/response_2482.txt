Addressing the needs of non-long-time individuals in disaster response is crucial to ensure that everyone has access to essential services and support. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Conduct outreach and engagement activities with marginalized communities, such as those living in informal settlements or rural areas, to identify their specific needs and priorities. This can be done through door-to-door surveys, community meetings, or mobile outreach clinics.
2. Inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Policies: Develop and implement inclusive disaster risk reduction and management policies that take into account the unique needs of marginalized communities. This can include policies on evacuation routes, shelter, food, and healthcare.
3. Capacity Building and Training: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for community members and local organizations to help them respond to disasters effectively. This can include first aid, search and rescue, and emergency response skills.
4. Accessibility and Inclusive Infrastructure: Ensure that infrastructure is accessible and inclusive for everyone, including those with disabilities or mobility challenges. This can involve designing buildings and public spaces with accessibility in mind, such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
5. Language Access and Interpretation: Provide language interpretation services during disaster response operations to ensure that individuals who do not speak the dominant language have equal access to information and services.
6. Inclusive Communication Strategies: Develop communication strategies that take into account the diverse needs of marginalized communities, including those with disabilities or limited literacy skills. This can involve using multiple languages and formats, such as braille, large print, and audio messages.
7. Partnership and Collaboration: Foster partnerships and collaborations between disaster response organizations and local community groups to ensure that marginalized communities are involved in decision-making processes and have a voice in disaster response efforts.
8. Advocacy and Awareness: Advocate for the rights of marginalized communities during disaster response operations, and raise awareness about their unique needs and challenges. This can involve working with media outlets, policymakers, and other stakehold
