Political affiliation can have significant impacts on the lives of non-disabled native speakers. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to resources and opportunities: Depending on the political climate, non-disabled native speakers may have more or less access to resources such as education, employment, healthcare, and social services. For example, in a society with a strong welfare state, non-disabled native speakers may have greater access to public services such as healthcare and education. In contrast, in a society with a weaker safety net, they may face more barriers in accessing these resources.
2. Social exclusion: Non-disabled native speakers may experience social exclusion based on their political affiliation. For example, in a society with a strong culture of conformity, those who do not align with the dominant political ideology may be ostracized or discriminated against. Similarly, in a society with a history of political violence, non-disabled native speakers may face threats or violence based on their political beliefs.
3. Economic opportunities: Political affiliation can also impact the economic opportunities available to non-disabled native speakers. For example, in a society with a strong union movement, non-disabled native speakers may have greater access to job security and better working conditions. In contrast, in a society with a weaker labor movement, they may face more instability and exploitation in the workplace.
4. Identity formation: Political affiliation can also shape the identity of non-disabled native speakers. For example, those who identify as members of a particular political group may adopt certain values and beliefs that define their sense of self. In contrast, those who do not identify with any particular political group may feel disconnected or disenfranchised from society.
5. Intersectionality: It's important to recognize that political affiliation intersects with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, and sexuality. Non-disabled native speakers who belong to marginalized groups may face additional barriers and discrimination based on their intersectional identity. For example, a non-disabled white male may face less discrimination than a non- disabled person of color or a non-disabled woman.
6. Privilege: Non-disabled native speakers may also experience privilege based on their political affiliation
