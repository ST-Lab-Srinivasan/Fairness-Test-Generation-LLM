Ensuring that the educational needs of infants and toddlers who are living in poverty are met is crucial for their cognitive, social, and emotional development. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide access to high-quality early childhood education: Infants and toddlers who attend high-quality early childhood programs have better cognitive and social outcomes compared to those who do not.

These programs have been shown to be effective in promoting positive outcomes for infants and toddlers living in poverty.
