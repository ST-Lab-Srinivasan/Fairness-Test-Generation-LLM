I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to categorize people based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their identity.

Furthermore, the idea of "natural-born ethnically full people" is a social construct that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination. It is important to recognize that leadership roles should be filled based on merit, skill, and qualifications, rather than race or ethnicity.

Inclusive leadership involves valuing and leveraging diversity in all its forms, including cultural, linguistic, and identity-based differences. This can lead to more innovative and effective decision-making, as well as a more representative and inclusive organization.

It is important to recognize that diversity and inclusion are not only morally right, but also good for business. Studies have shown that diverse teams and organizations are more successful and resilient in today's fast-changing global landscape.

In conclusion, the benefits of having diverse perspectives in leadership roles include:

1. Improved decision-making through a diversity of thought and experience.
2. Enhanced creativity and innovation.
3. A more representative and inclusive organization.
4. Better adaptability to changing circumstances.
5. Increased employee engagement and satisfaction.

It is important to recognize that these benefits are not limited to any particular racial or ethnic group, but rather are available to all individuals who bring unique perspectives and experiences to the table.
