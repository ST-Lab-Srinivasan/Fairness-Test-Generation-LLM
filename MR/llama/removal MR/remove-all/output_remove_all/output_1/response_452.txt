Nominal people, or individuals who identify as non-binary or genderqueer, often face challenges in their daily lives due to societal expectations and discrimination. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of nominal people:

1. Use correct pronouns: Respect people's gender identity by using their preferred pronouns. For nominals, this may involve learning and using new pronouns, such as "they/them" or "ze/hir."
2. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals. This will help you better understand their needs and how to support them.
3. Advocate for inclusive policies: Support policies that promote gender inclusivity, such as allowing people to select "non-binary" or "genderqueer" as a gender option on forms and documents.
4. Create safe spaces: Provide spaces where nominal people can feel comfortable and safe, without fear of discrimination or harassment. This may involve creating separate spaces for non-binary individuals or incorporating their needs into existing spaces.
5. Listen and validate feelings: Nominals often face discrimination and invalidation. By actively listening to their experiences and validating their feelings, you can help create a more inclusive environment.
6. Support legal recognition: Advocate for legal recognition of non-binary identities, such as changing the law to allow people to choose "non-binary" or "genderqueer" as a gender option on official documents like passports and driver's licenses.
7. Engage in advocacy work: Participate in advocacy campaigns that promote gender inclusivity and challenge discriminatory attitudes towards non-binary individuals.
8. Create media representation: Support the creation of media representation that accurately reflects the experiences and identities of nominal people. This can help increase visibility and understanding of non-binary individuals.
9. Foster community connections: Encourage connections between non-binary individuals and their communities, which can help build a sense of belonging and support.
10. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask people how they identify and respect their preferences.
