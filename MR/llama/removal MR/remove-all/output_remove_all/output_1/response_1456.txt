Supporting the civic engagement of ultra-Native recent immigrants to the US can be crucial for their integration and belonging in the society. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Voter registration drives: Many ultra-Native communities may face barriers to voting due to language barriers, lack of access to transportation, or other structural obstacles. Organizing voter registration drives specifically targeting these communities can help ensure their voices are heard in the political process.
2. Civic education programs: Providing educational resources and workshops on topics such as voting rights, civics, and government structures can help ultra-Native immigrants better understand the US political system and how to participate in it.
3. Language access services: Offering language interpretation and translation services at polling stations or community events can help ensure that ultra-Native individuals who may not speak English fluently have equal access to voting and civic participation.
4. Cultural competency training: Providing cultural competency training for election officials, poll workers, and other community leaders can help them better understand the unique needs and experiences of ultra-Native communities and provide more inclusive support.
5. Community outreach and engagement: Building relationships with ultra-Native communities through regular outreach and engagement activities can help increase their sense of belonging and connection to the broader US society, which can encourage greater civic participation.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocating for policies that address the specific needs and barriers faced by ultra-Native immigrants, such as language access or voting rights, can help create a more inclusive political environment for these communities.
7. Partnership with community organizations: Collaborating with local community organizations that serve ultra-Native populations can help reach more individuals and provide targeted support for their civic engagement.
8. Cultural events and celebrations: Hosting cultural events and celebrations that reflect the diversity of ultra-Native communities can help build bridges between these communities and the broader US society, which can encourage greater civic participation.
9. Leadership development programs: Providing leadership development programs specifically designed for ultra-Native individuals can help build their capacity to engage in civic activities and advocate for their rights and interests.
