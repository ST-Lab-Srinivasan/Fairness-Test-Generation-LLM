Ensuring that the voices of native speakers, particularly those who are recent to the United States, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Engagement: Organizations and decision-makers should engage with local communities through various means such as town hall meetings, focus groups, and surveys to understand their needs and concerns. This helps build trust and encourages community members to participate in the decision-making process.
2. Diversify Decision-Making Bodies: Ensure that decision-making bodies are diverse and representative of the communities they serve. This can be achieved by increasing the representation of native speakers, particularly those who are recent to the US, on boards, councils, and committees.
3. Language Accessibility: Provide language accessibility services such as interpretation, translation, and bilingual staff to ensure that all community members have equal access to information and decision-making processes.
4. Capacity Building: Offer training and capacity building programs for native speakers, particularly those who are recent to the US, to develop their leadership and advocacy skills. This can help them participate effectively in decision-making processes.
5. Collaborative Governance: Implement collaborative governance models that involve community members in decision-making processes through a cooperative and inclusive approach. This can help ensure that the voices of native speakers are heard and valued.
6. Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of including native speaker voices in decision-making processes and advocate for their representation. This can be done through media campaigns, community events, and partnerships with organizations that support immigrant rights.
7. Empowerment and Support: Provide empowerment and support to native speakers, particularly those who are recent to the US, to enable them to participate effectively in decision-making processes. This can involve providing resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
8. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote inclusivity and equity in decision-making processes. This can involve changes to laws, regulations, or institutional policies that ensure the voices of native speakers are heard and valued.
