Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting recent immigrant communities to the United States, particularly those who are not disabled. Here are some ways in which volunteers can make a positive impact:

1. Language Support: Many recent immigrants may struggle with language barriers, making it difficult for them to access essential services such as healthcare, education, and employment. Volunteers can help bridge this gap by providing language support, including translation and interpretation services.
2. Cultural Orientation: Immigrants often face cultural challenges in their new surroundings, which can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection. Volunteers can help orient them to local customs and practices, fostering a sense of belonging and inclusion.
