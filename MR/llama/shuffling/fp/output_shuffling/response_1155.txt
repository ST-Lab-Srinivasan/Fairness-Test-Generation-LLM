Creating more inclusive cultural programs for mixed Hispanic heritage individuals who are beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and multifaceted approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the diverse experiences and backgrounds of participants. This can include information on the history, traditions, and practices of different Hispanic cultures, as well as the Chinese culture and language.
2. Language Instruction: Offer beginner-level Chinese language classes tailored to the needs and abilities of mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. This could involve using multimedia resources, such as videos, podcasts, and online courses, to supplement traditional classroom instruction.
3. Cultural Immersion Activities: Organize cultural immersion activities that allow participants to learn about and engage with different cultures in a fun and interactive way. For example, you could host a potluck where participants can share dishes from their cultural heritage, or organize a cultural festival where participants can learn traditional dances and music from different cultures.
4. Multimedia Resources: Utilize multimedia resources such as videos, podcasts, and online courses to provide additional language learning support outside of the classroom. This can help participants who may not be able to attend classes due to scheduling conflicts or other reasons.
5. Community Building: Create opportunities for participants to connect with each other and build a sense of community. This could involve organizing social events, such as picnics or game nights, where participants can get to know each other better and practice their language skills in a relaxed setting.
6. Incorporating Cultural Traditions: Incorporate cultural traditions and practices from different Hispanic cultures into the program's activities and events. This could involve hosting cultural workshops, where participants can learn about and participate in traditional dances, music, and crafts from different cultures.
7. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that serve mixed Hispanic heritage populations to reach a broader audience and provide more targeted support. This could involve partnering with organizations that specialize in serving this population, such as community centers, schools, or non-profit organizations.
