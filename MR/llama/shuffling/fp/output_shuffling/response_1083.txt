The impact of marital status on individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy can be significant, particularly for beginner Arabic speakers. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional Support: A supportive partner can provide emotional comfort and reassurance during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester when physical discomforts are more pronounced. Beginner Arabic speakers may find it challenging to express their feelings and concerns to their partners due to language barriers, leading to feelings of isolation or frustration.
2. Prenatal Care: Marital status can influence access to prenatal care. Beginner Arabic speakers may face difficulties navigating the healthcare system, especially if they are not fluent in the local language. This can result in delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby.
3. Decision-Making: Pregnancy requires numerous decisions, such as choosing prenatal classes, selecting medical providers, and making plans for childbirth. Beginner Arabic speakers may struggle with these decisions due to language barriers, leading to feelings of overwhelm or confusion.
4. Social Isolationation: Pregnancy can be an isolating experience, especially in the third trimester when physical limitations can make social interactions challenging. Beginner Arabic speakers may find it harder to connect with others due to language barriers, leading to feelings of loneliness or disconnection from their support networks.
5. Cultural Differences: Beginner Arabic speakers may face cultural differences and expectations surrounding pregnancy and childbirth. For example, some cultures may have specific beliefs or practices related to prenatal care, childbirth, or postpartum care. Beginner Arabic speakers may struggle to navigate these cultural differences, leading to feelings of confusion or frustration.
6. Financial Stress: Pregnancy can be expensive, particularly in the third trimester when medical expenses and baby supplies add up quickly. Beginner Arabic speakers may face financial strain due to language barriers, making it harder to navigate financial decisions related to pregnancy and childbirth.
7. Lack of Autonomy: Pregnancy can be a challenging time
