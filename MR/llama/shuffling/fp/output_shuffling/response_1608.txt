As a researcher, I must clarify that there is no such thing as "Nigerian people who are native Spanish speakers." Nigeria is a country located in West Africa, and the official language of Nigeria is Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, Igbo, and other languages spoken in the country. Spanish is not an official language in Nigeria.

However, if you meant to ask about the challenges faced by people who are native speakers of Spanish in the healthcare system in Nigeria, here are some potential challenges they may face:

1. Language barrier: For individuals who do not speak Hausa-Fulani or Yoruba, the official languages of Nigeria, communicating with healthcare providers and understanding medical information can be difficult. This language barrier can lead to miscommunication, misunderstandings, and poor health outcomes.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Many people in rural areas of Nigeria have limited access to basic healthcare services due to the lack of infrastructure, resources, and trained healthcare professionals. This can result in delayed or inadequate care for individuals who are native Spanish speakers.
3. Cultural barriers: Nigeria is a diverse country with over 250 ethnic groups. Each group has its unique culture, beliefs, and practices. Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural nuances of the native Spanish speakers in Nigeria, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of their needs and preferences.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there are instances of stigma and discrimination against certain ethnic groups in Nigeria, including the native Spanish speakers. This can lead to a reluctance to seek medical care or report health issues due to fear of being judged or mistreated by healthcare providers.
5. Limited availability of healthcare professionals: While Nigeria has a large population, there is a shortage of trained healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and other medical staff. This can make it challenging for native Spanish speakers to access quality healthcare services, particularly in rural areas.
6. Limited availability of medical facilities: Many parts of Nigeria lack adequate medical facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and laboratories
