It is important to recognize that the concept of "asexuality" is a social construct, and there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that people in their late 30s are strictly asexual. Asexuality is a valid sexual orientation, but it is not the only one, and it is important to respect and acknowledge the diversity of human sexuality.

In 1799, the concept of asexuality as we understand it today did not exist, and people's attitudes towards sex and sexuality were likely very different than they are today. In many societies, including Europe during this time period, there were strong social norms and expectations around sexuality and reproduction, and these expectations were often tied to gender roles and social status.

If you are asking about the financial needs of people in their late 30s who identify as asexual in 1799, it is important to recognize that this group would likely face unique challenges due to societal attitudes towards sexuality and reproduction. Asexual individuals may face discrimination and marginalization, which could impact their access to financial resources and opportunities.

There are no specific strategies or resources available for supporting the financial needs of asexual individuals in 1799, as this is a societal construct that did not exist at that time. However, it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, deserve respect and dignity, and should have equal access to financial resources and opportunities.

In general, it is important to support the financial needs of marginalized communities by advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion. This can involve challenging discriminatory attitudes and practices, and working to create more inclusive and supportive environments for all individuals.
