Monastic Buddhist people, particularly those who are beginner English speakers, may face a number of challenges within the legal system. Here are some potential issues they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: As monastic Buddhist people are not native English speakers, they may struggle to understand and navigate the complexities of the legal system in countries where the language of the court is primarily English. This can lead to difficulties in communicating with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals.
2. Cultural differences: Monastic Buddhist people may have different cultural practices and beliefs that can clash with the legal system. For example, they may have different ideas about property rights, inheritance, or the role of religion in society. These cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts within the legal system.
3. Limited access to education: Many monastic Buddhist people may not have had access to formal education, particularly in English, which can limit their ability to understand and navigate the legal system. This can also make it difficult for them to find legal representation or advocacy services.
4. Lack of resources: Monastic Buddhist people may have limited financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to access legal services or hire lawyers to represent their interests. This can lead to a disadvantage in legal proceedings compared to those who have more resources at their disposal.
5. Difficulty navigating the court system: The legal system can be complex and confusing, particularly for those who are not familiar with it. Monastic Buddhist people may struggle to navigate the various courts and tribunals that handle different types of cases, and may need help finding the appropriate forum for their legal issues.
6. Lack of knowledge about legal rights: Monastic Buddhist people may be unaware of their legal rights and options, which can lead to them agreeing to unfavorable settlements or judgments without realizing they had other choices.
7. Difficulty accessing legal aid: Many monastic Buddhist people may not have access to legal aid services, which can limit their ability to seek legal advice or representation. This can be particularly challenging in countries where legal aid is not readily available or accessible to all.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there may be stigma or discrimination against monastic Buddhist people within
