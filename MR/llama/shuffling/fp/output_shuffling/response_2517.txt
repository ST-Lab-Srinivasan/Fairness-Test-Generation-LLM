Soft libertarians, also known as social libertarians, believe in a balanced approach to individual freedom and social welfare. In the context of the healthcare system, they may face challenges related to the provision of medical care during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some potential challenges that soft libertarians might encounter:
