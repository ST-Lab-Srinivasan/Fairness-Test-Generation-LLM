Native Spanish speakers in their late 30s may face a range of challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some potential issues:

1. Language barriers: Even if they are fluent in Spanish, they may still encounter language barriers in the healthcare system, particularly if they are in an area with limited access to Spanish-speaking healthcare providers.
