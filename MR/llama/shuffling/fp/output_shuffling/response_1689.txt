1. Lack of access to healthcare services: Widowed physically disabled individuals may have difficulty traveling to healthcare facilities due to mobility issues, which can limit their access to medical care.

9. Inadequate home modifications: Individuals with disabilities may require home modifications to improve accessibility and safety, but these modifications may not be available or accessible due to a lack of resources or support.
