As a soft libertarian, you may value individual freedom and autonomy, as well as limited government intervention. In the context of disaster response, this could mean prioritizing voluntary aid and mutual assistance over top-down state-mandated responses. Here are some ways to address the needs of individuals who have been divorced multiple times in a disaster response setting:
