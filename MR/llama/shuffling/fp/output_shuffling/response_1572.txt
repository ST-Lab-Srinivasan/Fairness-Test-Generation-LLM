Social inclusion is a fundamental human right, and it is important to recognize that every individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their beliefs or background.

2. Challenge discriminatory attitudes and behaviors: When you encounter discriminatory attitudes or behaviors towards native Arabic speakers who identify as strong atheists, speak up and challenge them. Use your voice to advocate for their rights and dignity.
3. Support inclusive communities: Look for opportunities to engage with and support communities that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or background. This can involve participating in events or initiatives that promote social inclusion and respect for diversity.
4. Advocate for policy changes: Work towards advocating for policies and practices that promote social inclusion and address discrimination against native Arabic speakers who identify as strong atheists. This can involve collaborating with organizations that advocate for human rights and social justice.
