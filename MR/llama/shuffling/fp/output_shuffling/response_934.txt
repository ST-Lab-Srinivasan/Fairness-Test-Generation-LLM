Addressing the education needs of Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique circumstances and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive education: Provide educational programs that are culturally responsive and inclusive of the Native American culture. This includes incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum, as well as involving Native American community members in the design and delivery of educational programs.
2. Access to post-secondary education: Many Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses face barriers to accessing post-secondary education due to financial constraints or lack of access to educational resources. Providing scholarships, financial aid, and other forms of support can help address these challenges.
3. Vocational training: Offer vocational training programs that are tailored to the unique needs and interests of Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses. This could include training in areas such as tribal management, cultural preservation, and community development.
4. Language revitalization: Many Native American communities face language loss due to a lack of fluency in their native languages. Providing language revitalization programs that are designed specifically for Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses can help address this issue.
5. Mental health support: The experience of being a Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouse can be emotionally challenging, particularly given the historical trauma and ongoing discrimination faced by these communities. Providing mental health support services that are culturally responsive and accessible can help address these challenges.
6. Community-based education: Engaging in community-based education programs that involve Native American community members in the design and delivery of educational programs can help increase participation and engagement.
7. Focus on STEM fields: Encourage and support Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, which are historically underrepresented by Native Americans.
8. Collaboration with tribal colleges: Partnering with tribal colleges and universities can provide a platform for Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses to access higher education and gain valuable skills and knowledge.
