Creating more inclusive cultural programs for mixed African-American individuals who are beginner Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency and sensitivity for program staff and volunteers. This can include understanding the experiences and perspectives of mixed African-American individuals, as well as being aware of the nuances of Arabic culture and language.
2. Inclusive Programming: Design programs that are inclusive of all participants, regardless of their race or ethnicity. For example, consider offering cultural events and activities that celebrate both African-American and Arab cultures, such as a Black History Month event that also acknowledges Arab-American contributions.
3. Bilingual Programming: Offer programming that is conducted in both Arabic and English to cater to the diverse language proficiency levels of participants. This can include offering beginner-friendly Arabic classes, as well as providing translation support for participants who may not be fluent in either language.
4. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities to build partnerships and gather feedback on program offerings. Reach out to mixed African-American communities and organizations to better understand their needs and preferences when it comes to cultural programming.
5. Representation Matters: Ensure that program staff and instructors are representative of the communities they serve. Hire bilingual Arabic-English speakers who are familiar with both cultures, and provide opportunities for mixed African-American individuals to take on leadership roles within the program.
6. Flexible Scheduling: Offer programming that caters to different schedules and needs of participants. For example, consider offering weekend or evening classes to accommodate those who may have work or school commitments during the day.
7. Collaboration with Other Organizations: Partner with other organizations that serve mixed African-American communities to cross-promote programming and reach a wider audience. This can include community centers, mosques, churches, and other cultural organizations.
8. Cultural Immersion: Offer opportunities for participants to immerse themselves in Arabic culture through events such as cultural festivals, language exchange programs, and cultural field trips.
9. Technology Integration: Utilize technology to provide accessible programming for mixed African-American individuals
