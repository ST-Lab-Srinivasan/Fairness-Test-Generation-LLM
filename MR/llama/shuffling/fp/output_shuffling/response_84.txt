Ensuring that the voices of full African American individuals, who are ethnically native English speakers, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting equity and inclusion. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen to their experiences: Create spaces where full African American individuals can share their experiences, perspectives, and concerns without fear of judgment or marginalization. This can be done through focus groups, community meetings, or one-on-one interviews.
2. Build trust: Establish relationships with full African American individuals based on mutual respect, empathy, and a commitment to understanding their experiences. This can involve spending time with them, learning from them, and demonstrating that you value their insights.
3. Involve them in decision-making processes: Full African Americans should be actively involved in decision-making processes that affect their communities, such as community planning, policy development, and program implementation. This can involve inviting them to participate in meetings, consultations, or working groups.
4. Provide opportunities for leadership: Full African Americans should have opportunities to take on leadership roles within their communities, organizations, or institutions. This can involve appointing them to leadership positions, providing mentorship and training, or creating spaces where they can develop their skills and expertise.
5. Address power imbalances: Power imbalances can prevent full African Americans from having their voices heard. Address these imbalances by challenging systems of oppression, dismantling barriers to participation, and promoting equitable decision-making processes.
6. Use inclusive language and practices: Ensure that language and practices used in decision-making processes are inclusive and respectful of full African American experiences. This can involve using language that is free from stereotypes and biases, and adopting practices that promote inclusivity and diversity.
7. Provide cultural competency training: Provide cultural competency training for those involved in decision-making processes to help them understand the unique experiences and perspectives of full African Americans. This can involve teaching them about the history, culture, and struggles of this community.
8. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Ongoing dialogue and communication is essential for ensuring that the voices of full African Americans are heard.
