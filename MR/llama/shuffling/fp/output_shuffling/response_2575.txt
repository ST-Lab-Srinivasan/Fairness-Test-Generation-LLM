Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for individuals not recently widowed who are non-libertarian requires thoughtful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse groups in the planning process: Ensure that the planning committee includes representatives from different backgrounds, cultures, and belief systems. This will help create a more inclusive and diverse celebration.
2. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be respectful of the cultural practices and traditions of those involved in the celebration. Avoid cultural appropriation by understanding the significance of cultural symbols, colors, and rituals.
3. Offer accommodations for non-libertarian beliefs: Provide options that cater to the beliefs and practices of individuals who may not identify as libertarian. For example, offer vegetarian or vegan options for meals, or provide non-alcoholic drinks for those who do not consume alcohol.
4. Encourage participation from all: Create opportunities for individuals to participate in the celebration regardless of their cultural background. Offer workshops, performances, or activities that cater to different interests and preferences.
5. Celebrate diversity through music and art: Incorporate music and art forms from diverse cultures into the celebration. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and allow individuals to express themselves in a way that feels authentic to their cultural identity.
6. Provide language support: Offer translation services or provide multilingual materials for individuals who may not speak the dominant language of the area.
7. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair-accessible spaces, sign language interpretation, and braille materials.
8. Encourage cross-cultural exchange: Facilitate opportunities for individuals from different cultures to share their traditions, customs, and practices with each other. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and foster mutual respect and understanding.
9. Avoid stereotyping: Refrain from using cultural symbols or practices as a form of entertainment without proper understanding or permission. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing dominant cultures over minority cultures.
