I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to create or promote content that discriminates or marginalizes any group of people, including those based on their sexual orientation or immigration status. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or immigration status, are entitled to equal rights and dignity under the law.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. This can involve using data to highlight the issues faced by marginalized communities, such as discrimination, inequality, and social injustice, and working towards solutions that promote equality and fairness for all.

Remember, data can be a powerful tool for advocacy and change, but it must be used responsibly and ethically to promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals.
