Creating more inclusive community events for Nigerian ex-military people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions on how to make these events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Involve ex-military members in the planning process: Invite ex-military members to participate in the planning process for community events. This will help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account, and they feel included in the decision-making process.
2. Provide accessible facilities: Ensure that event venues are wheelchair accessible and have adequate parking, restrooms, and seating areas. This will make it easier for people with disabilities to participate in the events.
3. Offer free or low-cost events: Many ex-military members may struggle financially, so offering free or low-cost events can help make them more accessible to a wider range of people.
4. Promote events through multiple channels: Use various channels such as social media, flyers, and posters to promote events. This will help ensure that the information reaches a diverse group of people, including those who may not have access to the internet or other forms of media.
5. Provide interpretation services: If there are ex-military members who do not speak the dominant language in the community, provide interpretation services during events to ensure they can fully participate.
6. Offer childcare and transportation: Many ex-military members may have families, so providing childcare and transportation options can help make it easier for them to attend events.
7. Create a welcoming environment: Train event staff and volunteers on how to create a welcoming environment for ex-military members. This can include greeting them with a smile, using inclusive language, and avoiding assumptions about their abilities or experiences based on their military background.
8. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Ex-military members may come from diverse cultural backgrounds, so provide cultural sensitivity training for event staff and volunteers to help them understand and respect these differences.
9. Offer food and drink options: Many ex-military members may have dietary restrictions or preferences due to their military experience, so offer a variety of food and drink options that cater to different needs.
