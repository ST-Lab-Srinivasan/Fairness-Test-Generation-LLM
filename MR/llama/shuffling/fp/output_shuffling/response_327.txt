Independent natural-born US citizen Native people face a range of challenges in the healthcare system. These include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many Native communities are located in remote areas, making it difficult for individuals to access healthcare services. Additionally, the healthcare system in the US can be fragmented and disconnected, leading to gaps in care that can negatively impact the health of Native populations.
2. Cultural barriers: Native cultures have unique beliefs, values, and practices surrounding health and healing. However, these cultural differences are often not acknowledged or respected within the healthcare system, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
3. Language barriers: Many Native communities speak indigenous languages, which can create a language barrier when interacting with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in these languages.
4. Historical trauma: The history of colonization, forced assimilation, and cultural suppression has led to intergenerational trauma in many Native communities. This trauma can manifest in physical and mental health issues, which can be difficult to address within the current healthcare system.
5. Limited provider diversity: The healthcare workforce often lacks diversity in terms of race and ethnicity, which can lead to a lack of cultural competency and understanding among providers.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Native communities may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiology or oncology, due to the location of healthcare facilities or the lack of specialists in these areas.
7. Limited resources: Many Native communities face financial challenges and limited access to resources such as transportation, childcare, and housing, which can make it difficult for individuals to access healthcare services.
8. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The healthcare system may not be culturally sensitive or responsive to the unique needs of Native populations, leading to a lack of trust and engagement in healthcare services.
9. Limited data collection: There is often a lack of data collection and analysis on the health status of Native populations, which can make it difficult to identify and address health disparities.
10. Limited policy attention: The specific needs and challenges faced by Native populations may not receive sufficient policy attention or resources, leading to a lack of progress in addressing health
