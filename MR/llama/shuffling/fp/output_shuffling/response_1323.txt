Ensuring that the voices of individuals who are beginner English speakers and recently divorced multiple times are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to include and empower these marginalized groups. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide language support and interpretation services during decision-making processes to ensure that non-English speakers can participate fully. This could involve providing translation services, using visual aids, or hiring interpreters who are fluent in the languages spoken by the marginalized groups.
2. Inclusive Communication: Use plain language and avoid technical jargon to make decision-making processes more accessible to individuals with limited English proficiency. Provide written materials in multiple languages and offer supportive services, such as childcare or transportation, to ensure that everyone can participate.
3. Capacity Building: Offer training and capacity-building programs specifically designed for marginalized groups, including beginner English speakers and recently divorced individuals. These programs can help build skills in areas like leadership, advocacy, and decision-making, which can enhance their ability to participate fully in these processes.
4. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to raise awareness about the importance of inclusive decision-making processes. This could involve collaborating with local organizations, hosting community events, or using social media platforms to reach a wider audience.
5. Accountability Mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms to ensure that marginalized groups are included in decision-making processes and their voices are heard. This could involve setting clear targets and indicators of success, establishing monitoring and evaluation frameworks, or implementing grievance redressal mechanisms.
6. Partnerships and Collaborations: Foster partnerships and collaborations with organizations that work specifically with marginalized groups. These partners can provide valuable support and expertise in ensuring that the voices of these groups are heard in decision-making processes.
7. Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of inclusive decision-making processes and advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion. This could involve working with media outlets, engaging in public campaigns, or collaborating with influencers and thought leaders to amplify the message.
