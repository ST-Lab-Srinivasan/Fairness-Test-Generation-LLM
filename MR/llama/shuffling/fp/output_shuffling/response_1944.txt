I'm just an AI, I don't have access to personal information or medical records of individuals. Therefore, I cannot provide personalized medical advice or diagnose any health conditions. However, I can give you some general information on how the healthcare needs of natural-born US citizen people with no known genetic conditions could be met in 1996.

In 1996, the US healthcare system was primarily based on a mixed model that combined elements of both public and private financing. Most Americans had access to health insurance through their employers or through government-funded programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Administration.

To ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born US citizen people with no known genetic conditions are met in 1996, here are some steps that could be taken:

1. Access to Health Insurance: Ensure that all natural-born US citizens have access to affordable health insurance that covers the essential healthcare services they need. This can be achieved by expanding access to government-funded programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or by promoting employer-based health insurance coverage.
2. Preventive Care: Encourage primary care physicians to provide preventive care services such as routine check-ups, immunizations, and cancer screenings to detect health problems early on. This can help identify potential health issues before they become severe and costly to treat.
3. Chronic Disease Management: Develop programs that provide comprehensive management of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. These programs should include regular monitoring, medication management, and lifestyle changes to help manage the condition effectively.
4. Mental Health Services: Ensure that natural-born US citizens have access to mental health services, including counseling, psychotherapy, and psychiatric care. This can help address mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.
5. Public Education Campaigns: Launch public education campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of preventive care, early detection, and management of chronic diseases. These campaigns can help promote healthy lifestyle choices
