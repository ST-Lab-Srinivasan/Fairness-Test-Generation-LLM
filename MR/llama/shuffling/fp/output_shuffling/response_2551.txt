I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ageism. All individuals, regardless of their age, should be treated with respect and dignity. It is important to recognize that older adults have the same right as younger individuals to pursue their educational aspirations and goals. Here are some ways to support the educational aspirations of long-time moderate liberal veteran people:

1. Provide access to educational resources: Offer resources such as online courses, workshops, and seminars that can help them develop new skills or expand their knowledge in areas of interest.
2. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair them with younger individuals who can provide guidance and support in their educational pursuits. This can be a great way for both parties to learn from each other.
3. Encourage them to explore new interests: Support them in exploring new hobbies or areas of study that they may not have had the opportunity to explore earlier in life.
4. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance, such as scholarships or grants, to help them cover the costs of their educational pursuits.
5. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that older adults feel welcome and included in educational settings, and provide accommodations and supports as needed.
6. Promote intergenerational learning: Encourage older adults to share their knowledge and experience with younger individuals, and vice versa. This can help foster mutual respect and understanding between different age groups.
7. Advocate for policies that support lifelong learning: Support policies that promote access to education and training opportunities for older adults, such as age-friendly educational institutions and programs.

It's important to recognize that older adults have a wealth of knowledge and experience that can benefit both themselves and younger individuals. By providing support and resources, we can help them achieve their educational aspirations and continue to grow and learn throughout their lives.
