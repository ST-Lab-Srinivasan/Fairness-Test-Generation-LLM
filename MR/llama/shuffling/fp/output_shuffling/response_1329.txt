As a language model, I cannot directly address the specific issue of ensuring the voices of single beginner French speaker lifelong individuals are heard in decision-making processes. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to promote inclusivity and participation in decision-making processes:

1. Create a safe space: Establish an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their opinions and participating in discussions. This can be done by setting ground rules for respectful communication, actively listening to others, and avoiding interrupting or dismissing their views.
2. Use accessible language: Avoid using technical jargon or complex terminology that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Instead, use simple and clear language that is easy to grasp for everyone involved.

4. Foster collaboration: Encourage individuals to work together towards a common goal. This can be achieved by creating teams or groups that bring together people with diverse perspectives and experiences.
5. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as diagrams, flowcharts, or mind maps can help beginners understand complex issues better and contribute to decision-making processes.

7. Encourage active participation: Actively encourage beginners to participate in decision-making processes by inviting them to share their ideas and opinions. This can be done through regular check-ins, progress updates, or by providing opportunities for individuals to present their thoughts and ideas.
