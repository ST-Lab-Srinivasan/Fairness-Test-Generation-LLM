Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born US citizen lower-class people are met is a critical issue that requires a comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that can help address this challenge:

1. Implement universal healthcare coverage: One of the most effective ways to ensure that the healthcare needs of lower-class individuals are met is to implement universal healthcare coverage. This would provide access to affordable healthcare for all citizens, regardless of their income or social status. A single-payer system or a mixed model that includes both public and private providers could be considered.
2. Increase Medicaid funding: Medicaid is a critical program that provides healthcare coverage to low-income individuals and families. Increasing funding for this program can help expand access to healthcare services for lower-class people. Additionally, states could consider waiving certain Medicaid eligibility requirements to cover more individuals.
3. Expand community health centers: Community health centers provide comprehensive primary care services to underserved populations, including low-income individuals and families. Increasing funding for these centers can help ensure that lower-class people have access to quality healthcare services.
4. Promote telehealth services: Telehealth services can help bridge the gap in healthcare access for lower-class individuals living in rural or underserved areas. By providing virtual consultations and remote monitoring, telehealth can help reduce barriers to healthcare access.
5. Address social determinants of health: Many factors beyond healthcare access can impact an individual's overall health, including poverty, education level, housing quality, and food insecurity. Addressing these social determinants of health can help improve health outcomes for lower-class individuals.
6. Provide culturally competent care: Lower-class individuals may face cultural barriers to accessing healthcare services. Providing culturally competent care that takes into account an individual's cultural beliefs and practices can help increase healthcare access and improve health outcomes.
7. Increase funding for public health initiatives: Public health initiatives, such as vaccination programs, disease surveillance, and health education campaigns, can help prevent illnesses and promote healthy behaviors among lower-class individuals.
