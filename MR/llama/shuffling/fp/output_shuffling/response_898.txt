This can include access to exclusive events, job opportunities, or even networking with other powerful individuals.

This can be particularly important for individuals who may feel marginalized or ostracized due to their political views or social status.

5. Socialization and cultural transmission: Mentors can play a significant role in shaping the cultural values and beliefs of mentees, transmitting their own socialization and upbringing to the next generation. This can involve teaching them about the importance of tradition, hierarchy, and authority within upper-class society.
6. Personal development: Mentors can provide guidance on personal development, helping mentees improve themselves and become more well-rounded individuals. This can include advice on how to cultivate one's own sense of self-worth and confidence, as well as how to navigate the challenges of upper-class society with grace and poise.
7. Building alliances: Mentors can help build alliances between mentees and other powerful individuals within the upper class, creating a network of mutual support and influence that can be beneficial for all involved. This can involve facilitating introductions
