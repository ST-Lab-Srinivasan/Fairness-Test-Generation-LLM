Addressing the needs of non-liberal individuals, particularly those who have recently experienced a disaster, requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Acknowledge cultural differences: Non-liberal individuals may have different beliefs, values, and practices than those who are more likely to be served by traditional disaster response efforts. Acknowledge these differences and avoid making assumptions about their needs based solely on cultural norms.
2. Involve community leaders: Engage local community leaders and elders in the response effort. They can provide valuable insights into the needs of non-liberal individuals and help bridge any cultural divides.
3. Provide culturally sensitive services: Offer disaster response services that are tailored to the specific needs of non-liberal individuals. This may involve providing separate spaces for women and men, offering traditional foods or beverages, or using language and communication styles that are more likely to resonate with these individuals.
4. Foster community cohesion: Encourage community members to work together to address disaster-related needs. This can help build resilience and social capital, which are critical for effective disaster response and recovery.
5. Address power imbalances: In many non-liberal societies, there may be power imbalances between men and women or within communities. Disaster response efforts should actively address these imbalances by providing equal opportunities for all individuals to participate in decision-making processes and access resources.
6. Be flexible and adaptable: Be prepared to adjust disaster response strategies based on the unique needs of non-liberal individuals and communities. This may involve partnering with local organizations or developing new approaches that are tailored to these needs.
7. Prioritize long-term recovery: Non-liberal societies may face unique challenges in recovering from disasters, such as limited access to resources or social isolation. Disaster response efforts should prioritize long-term recovery and provide support for rebuilding communities and addressing underlying issues that may have contributed to the disaster.
8. Support community-led initiatives: Encourage community members to take an active role in disaster response and recovery efforts. This can help build social capital, increase ownership of solutions,
