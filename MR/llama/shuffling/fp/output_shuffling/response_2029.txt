Creating more inclusive cultural programs for full Hispanic individuals who are beginner English speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for program staff and volunteers to help them understand and appreciate the diverse experiences, values, and beliefs of the Hispanic community.
2. Language Accessibility: Ensure that all program materials and communications are available in both English and Spanish, and make sure that interpreters or translators are available for those who need them.
3. Inclusive Programming: Develop programs that are inclusive of Hispanic culture and traditions, such as traditional music, dance, and art. Encourage participants to share their cultural practices and experiences.
4. Bilingual Staff: Hire bilingual staff and volunteers who can communicate with participants in both English and Spanish. This will help create a more welcoming environment for beginners who may not speak fluent English.
5. Cultural Ambassadors: Identify and train cultural ambassadors from the Hispanic community to serve as leaders and mentors within the program. These individuals can help bridge the gap between the Hispanic community and the organization, ensuring that program materials and activities are culturally relevant and meaningful.
6. Community Outreach: Engage in targeted outreach to the Hispanic community through social media, flyers, and word of mouth. This will help increase awareness of the program and encourage participation from within the community.
7. Flexibility and Adaptability: Be flexible and adaptable when working with participants who may have different communication styles or cultural practices. This can involve being patient, open-minded, and willing to learn and accommodate their needs.
8. Inclusive Facilities: Ensure that facilities are accessible and inclusive for all participants, including those with disabilities. Provide interpreters or CART services for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
9. Culturally Relevant Materials: Use culturally relevant materials in program activities, such as books, videos, and music that reflect the experiences and perspectives of the Hispanic community.
10. Evaluation and Feedback: Regularly evaluate the program's effectiveness in
