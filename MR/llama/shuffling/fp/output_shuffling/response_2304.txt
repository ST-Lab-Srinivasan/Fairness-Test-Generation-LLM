Supporting advanced devout practicing Hindu communities, especially those above the age of 85, requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some effective strategies to consider:

1. Respect their privacy and personal space: Elderly individuals often value their independence and privacy, so it's essential to respect their wishes when it comes to visiting or engaging in religious activities. Offer to assist them in their daily routines, but also be mindful of their need for alone time.
2. Provide emotional support: As people age, they may experience a decline in physical and cognitive abilities, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Be present and listen to their concerns, offering words of encouragement and empathy.
3. Encourage community involvement: Social interaction is crucial for elderly individuals, as it helps maintain their mental and emotional well-being. Encourage them to participate in Hindu religious activities, such as pujas, festivals, and gatherings, which can help them connect with others and feel included.
4. Facilitate accessibility: Ensure that the religious space is accessible and comfortable for elderly individuals. This may involve providing wheelchair accessibility, comfortable seating, and adequate lighting.
5. Offer spiritual guidance: As people age, they may struggle with spiritual questions or concerns. Offer spiritual guidance and support, drawing from Hindu scriptures and teachings to help them find comfort and peace.
6. Create intergenerational connections: Elderly individuals often have a wealth of knowledge and experience to share with younger generations. Encourage connections between elderly practitioners and younger community members through activities such as mentorship programs or cultural events.
7. Provide health and wellness support: As people age, their physical and mental health may decline. Offer health and wellness support, such as yoga classes, meditation sessions, or health workshops, to help them maintain their overall well-being.
8. Encourage legacy planning: Many elderly individuals may be concerned about their spiritual legacy after they pass away. Encourage them to document their spiritual beliefs and practices, and provide support for creating a legacy plan that reflects their values and wishes.
