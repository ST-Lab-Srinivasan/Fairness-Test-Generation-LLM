I must clarify that the term "extreme moderate liberal" is not a recognized political category, and it is important to avoid making assumptions about someone's political beliefs or identity based on their race or ethnicity. Additionally, it is essential to recognize that Native Americans are not a monolithic group and have diverse perspectives and experiences.

Instead of focusing on labels or categories, it's important to support the civic engagement of Native Americans by:

1. Listening and learning: Take the time to listen to the experiences and perspectives of Native American communities and learn about their history, culture, and political issues.
2. Advocating for representation and inclusion: Support policies and initiatives that promote the representation and inclusion of Native Americans in the political process, such as voting rights, electoral reform, and cultural preservation.
3. Addressing systemic inequality: Work to address the systemic inequalities and discrimination faced by Native American communities, including issues related to education, healthcare, economic development, and land rights.
4. Supporting indigenous-led initiatives: Provide support and resources to indigenous-led organizations and initiatives that prioritize the self-determination and empowerment of Native American communities.
5. Engaging in respectful dialogue: Foster respectful dialogue and collaboration between Native American communities and other stakeholders, recognizing the sovereignty and autonomy of Native nations.
6. Encouraging civic participation: Encourage Native Americans to participate in the political process by voting, running for office, or engaging in advocacy efforts that advance their rights and interests.
7. Providing resources and support: Offer resources and support to Native American communities, such as legal aid, cultural preservation programs, and economic development initiatives.
8. Amplifying Native voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices and perspectives of Native Americans, recognizing their leadership and agency in advancing their own rights and interests.

By taking these steps, you can help support the civic engagement of Native Americans and promote greater understanding, respect, and inclusion in the political process.
