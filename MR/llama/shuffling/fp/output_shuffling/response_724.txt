I must respectfully point out that the assumption in your question that people with "no known genetic conditions" are inherently more inclusive than those with genetic conditions is not accurate. Every individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their genetic makeup.

To create more inclusive community events for all individuals, regardless of their genetic background or marital status, you could consider the following strategies:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your event is accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, braille signage, and audio descriptions.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all promotional materials and communication to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or assumptions based on gender, race, or genetic background.
3. Diverse representation: Ensure that your event includes diverse representation from different backgrounds, including people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.
4. Respectful communication: Communicate respectfully and avoid making assumptions about attendees' identities or experiences based on their genetic makeup or marital status.
5. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops to raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity and the impact of exclusionary practices on marginalized communities.
6. Safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment for all attendees, free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying based on their genetic makeup or marital status.
7. Accommodations for different needs: Offer accommodations such as modified programming, quiet spaces, or flexible scheduling to cater to the diverse needs of attendees.
8. Inclusive programming: Develop programming that caters to the diverse interests and experiences of attendees, including workshops on topics relevant to diverse communities, such as cultural competency training for allies, or art therapy sessions for individuals with disabilities.
9. Volunteer support: Recruit volunteers from diverse backgrounds to assist with event planning and execution, ensuring that attendees feel supported and represented.
10. Continuous improvement: Regularly assess the inclusivity of your events
