I apologize, but the question you provided does not make sense. The phrase "not divorced multiple times" is a contradictory statement as divorce is a life event that typically involves the termination of a marriage. Therefore, it is not possible for someone to have been divorced multiple times and still be in the job market.

If you meant to ask about the challenges faced by people who have been through a divorce in the job market, here are some potential challenges:

1. Stigma: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma associated with divorce in many cultures, which can make it difficult for individuals to be open about their marital history when searching for work.
2. Limited job opportunities: Divorced individuals may face discrimination or limited job opportunities due to the perception that they are less reliable or committed than their married counterparts.
3. Financial challenges: Divorce can be financially draining, and individuals may struggle to make ends meet after a divorce, particularly if they were dependent on their spouse for financial support.
4. Career disruption: Divorce can disrupt an individual's career trajectory, particularly if they had to take time off to care for children or handle family responsibilities during the marriage.
5. Emotional challenges: Going through a divorce can be emotionally draining, and individuals may struggle to cope with the emotional fallout of the split. This can impact their performance in the job market.

It is important to note that these challenges can vary depending on individual circumstances and cultural context. However, by acknowledging and addressing these challenges, organizations and society as a whole can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for all individuals, regardless of their marital status.
