6. Technology training: Provide technology training for seniors, teaching them how to use digital tools and platforms to stay connected with family and friends, access information, and engage in social activities.
7. Legal support: Offer legal support services specifically tailored to the needs of senior Mexicans, including assistance with wills, powers of attorney, and other legal matters that may be challenging for them to navigate alone.
