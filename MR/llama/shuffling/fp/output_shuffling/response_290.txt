Promoting artistic expression among the elderly, regardless of their socio-economic status, is crucial for fostering creativity, cognitive function, and overall well-being. Here are some strategies to promote artistic expression among the elderly, particularly those from low-income backgrounds:

1. Community Arts Programs: Develop community arts programs that cater to the needs of older adults, regardless of their economic status.

This could involve pairing elderly individuals with local students or young artists to work on joint art projects or share knowledge and skills.
