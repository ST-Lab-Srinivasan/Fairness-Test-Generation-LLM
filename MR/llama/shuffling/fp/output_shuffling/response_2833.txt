As a strong atheist natural-born Canadian citizen, I believe that it is essential to promote inclusivity and equality in all aspects of society. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies for individuals like me:

1. Separation of Church and State: Ensure that the state remains neutral on matters of religion and does not favor any particular belief system. This will allow individuals of all beliefs to feel included and respected.
2. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Enact laws that protect individuals from discrimination based on their beliefs, including atheism. This will help ensure that individuals are not unfairly treated or denied opportunities because of their beliefs.
3. Education Reform: Advocate for inclusive and secular education that promotes critical thinking and scientific inquiry. This will help to break down religious dogma and promote a more open-minded and tolerant society.
4. Promote Reason and Evidence: Encourage the use of reason and evidence in decision-making and public discourse. This will help to combat misinformation and superstition, and promote a more rational and secular society.
5. Support Free Speech: Advocate for the right to free speech and expression, without fear of persecution or discrimination. This will allow individuals to express their beliefs and opinions freely, without fear of reprisal.
6. Encourage Dialogue and Understanding: Foster open and respectful dialogue between individuals of different belief systems. This will help to promote understanding and empathy, and reduce misunderstandings and conflicts.
7. Advocate for Reproductive Rights: Work towards ensuring that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health. This will include access to safe and legal abortion, as well as comprehensive sexual education.
8. Support LGBTQ+ Rights: Advocate for the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, including marriage equality and protection from discrimination. This will help to promote a more inclusive and tolerant society.
9. Address Income Inequality: Work towards reducing income inequality and ensuring that all individuals have access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. This will help to create a more just and equitable society.
