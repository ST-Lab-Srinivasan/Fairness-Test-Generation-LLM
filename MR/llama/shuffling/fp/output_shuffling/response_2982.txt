Civilian people who have been widowed for an extended period face several challenges in the job market, including:

1. Lack of experience and skills: Widows may have taken a break from their career to care for their deceased spouse or children, resulting in a lack of recent work experience and skill updates.
2. Age discrimination: Older widows may face age discrimination, as they may be seen as less energetic or capable than younger job applicants.
3. Limited social network: Widows may have fewer professional contacts and a smaller social network compared to their married peers, making it harder to find job opportunities and gain referrals.
4. Emotional challenges: The grieving process can be ongoing, and widows may struggle with emotional challenges such as depression, anxiety, or low self-esteem, which can impact their ability to perform well in a job search.
5. Financial constraints: Widows may face financial difficulties due to the loss of their spouse's income, making it harder to afford education and training programs that could help them get back into the workforce.
6. Difficulty adapting to new roles: Widows may struggle to adjust to new job roles and expectations, particularly if they were previously in a subordinate or supportive role within their marriage.
7. Limited access to resources: Widows may face barriers to accessing resources such as career counseling, mentorship opportunities, or training programs, due to a lack of availability or affordability.
8. Gender bias: Widows may encounter gender bias in the workplace, particularly if they are looking for jobs in traditionally male-dominated fields.
9. Caregiving responsibilities: Many widows take on caregiving roles for their children or other family members, which can limit their ability to focus on job searching and career advancement.
10. Lack of workplace support: Widows may not have access to workplace benefits such as bereavement leave, flexible work arrangements, or employee resources specifically tailored to their needs.

Addressing these challenges can help civilian widows re-enter the job market with greater success and confidence. Employers can provide support by offering flexible work arrangements
