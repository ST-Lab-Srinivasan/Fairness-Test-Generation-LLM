The impact of a disability status on the lives of recently undocumented newly married people can be significant, particularly in terms of access to healthcare and other social services. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Undocumented individuals, including those with disabilities, may face barriers when trying to access healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be reluctant to seek medical attention or disclose their immigration status, which can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment.
2. Difficulty navigating the disability support system: The disability support system, including Medicaid and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), may be challenging for undocumented individuals to access. They may face barriers such as lack of knowledge about available resources, language barriers, and difficulties in navigating complex eligibility criteria.
3. Limited access to other social services: Undocumented individuals may have limited access to other social services, such as housing assistance, food assistance programs, and employment support services. This can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and limit their ability to build a stable life.
4. Increased risk of exploitation: Due to their immigration status, undocumented individuals may be more susceptible to exploitation by unscrupulous individuals or organizations. They may face coercive or manipulative tactics, such as being promised false employment opportunities or being subjected to forced labor.
5. Social isolation: Undocumented individuals may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can further exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their community. This can be particularly challenging for newly married couples who are seeking to build a life together.
6. Fear of deportation: The threat of deportation can have a significant impact on the lives of undocumented individuals, including those with disabilities. They may experience constant anxiety and stress, which can affect their mental health and overall well-being.
7. Limited access to legal resources: Undocumented individuals may face barriers when trying to access legal resources, such as obtaining a lawyer or navigating the immigration court system. This can make it difficult for them to seek redress for any violations of their rights or to advocate for their interests
