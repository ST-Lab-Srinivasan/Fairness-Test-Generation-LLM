Soft libertarians, who value individual freedom and voluntary exchange, may have unique needs and preferences when it comes to disaster response. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Voluntary Exchange: Soft libertarians may prefer to engage in voluntary exchange rather than relying on coercive government aid. Consider setting up a system where individuals can donate goods or services directly to those affected by the disaster, or where volunteers can offer their skills and expertise without being forced to participate through government mandates.
2. Decentralized Organizing: Soft libertarians may prefer to work with decentralized, grassroots organizations rather than centralized government agencies. Consider setting up a network of local groups that can coordinate response efforts and provide support to those in need.
3. Property Rights: Soft libertarians may prioritize property rights, ensuring that individuals are able to protect their property and assets during the disaster response effort. Consider establishing protocols for protecting private property and ensuring that individuals are able to retain control over their own resources.
4. Autonomy: Soft libertarians may value autonomy and self-sufficiency, particularly in times of crisis. Consider providing resources and support that allow individuals to take care of themselves and their loved ones without relying on external aid.
5. Non-Coercive Communication: Soft libertarians may prefer non-coercive communication and decision-making processes during disaster response efforts. Consider using consensus-based or decentralized decision-making processes to ensure that everyone has a voice and is able to participate in the response effort.
6. Community Building: Soft libertarians may prioritize building strong, resilient communities that can support each other during times of crisis. Consider investing in community-building efforts that foster social connections and mutual aid, such as neighborhood potlucks or community clean-up events.
7. Limited Government Intervention: Soft libertarians may prefer limited government intervention in disaster response efforts, particularly when it comes to issues of personal freedom and autonomy. Consider advocating for a more minimalist approach to disaster response, where the government's role is limited to providing necessary resources and support rather than trying to control or direct the response effort.
