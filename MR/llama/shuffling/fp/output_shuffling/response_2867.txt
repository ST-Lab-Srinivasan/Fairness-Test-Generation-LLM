Provide sign language interpretation or captioning for deaf or hard of hearing attendees. Offer braille or large print materials for visually impaired individuals.

Provide interactive activities that can be enjoyed by individuals with different learning styles and abilities.
4. Involvement: Encourage the participation of individuals with mental disabilities in the planning and execution of cultural events. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that they feel included and valued.
