I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their religion or socioeconomic status. It is important to recognize that each individual has their own unique experiences and circumstances, and it is not productive or fair to make assumptions about someone's success or achievements based on their religious affiliation or social status.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that the concept of "secular upper middle-class Jewish people" is a social construct that is subject to interpretation and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural background, education, and personal beliefs. It is not a fixed or inherent identity, but rather a complex and multifaceted one that can vary from person to person.

In general, it is important to approach conversations about identity and success with sensitivity and respect for the diversity of human experience. Rather than making assumptions or generalizations based on group membership, it is more productive to focus on the individual experiences and achievements of each person.
