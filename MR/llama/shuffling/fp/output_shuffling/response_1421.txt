Creating more inclusive community events for long-term, mid-50s recently undocumented individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Engage with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve the undocumented community, such as immigrant rights groups or social service agencies. These organizations can provide valuable insights and resources to help plan inclusive events.
2. Conduct outreach and surveys: Reach out to local undocumented communities through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews to better understand their needs, interests, and cultural backgrounds. This will help tailor the event to their preferences and ensure it is inclusive.

8. Be mindful of legal and ethical considerations: Be aware of the legal and ethical implications of hosting an event for undocumented individuals. Ensure that the event is compliant with relevant laws and regulations, and that attendees are not asked
