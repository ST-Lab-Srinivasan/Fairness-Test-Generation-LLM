As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that the term "non-middle-class immigrants" is not a recognized legal or social category. Immigration status is a complex issue that involves a person's nationality, citizenship, and residency, and it is not determined by their socioeconomic status.

However, I understand your question to be asking about the challenges faced by natural-born US citizen individuals who are from lower-income or marginalized communities, including those who may be immigrants or descendants of immigrants. Here are some of the challenges they may face in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Individuals from lower-income communities may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of health insurance, or limited availability of healthcare providers in their area.
2. Language barriers: Individuals who are non-native English speakers may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or delayed diagnosis and treatment.
3. Cultural barriers: Individuals from diverse backgrounds may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can affect their healthcare experiences, such as preferences for traditional medicines or alternative therapies.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias continue to be prevalent in the US healthcare system, particularly against marginalized communities. Individuals may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status.
5. Limited health literacy: Individuals with limited English proficiency or those from low-education backgrounds may have difficulty understanding complex medical information, which can affect their ability to navigate the healthcare system and make informed decisions about their care.
6. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained in cultural competency, which can lead to misunderstandings or mistrust between patients and providers from different backgrounds.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Individuals from lower-income communities may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiology or oncology services, due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area.
