1. Culturally responsive teaching: Mixed-Caucasian students may face unique challenges related to their racial identity and may benefit from culturally responsive teaching practices. This approach focuses on creating learning environments that value and respect the cultural backgrounds of all students, including those who are mixed-race.

Educators can provide support for identity development by creating safe spaces for students to explore and express their identities, and by offering resources and referrals for identity-related counseling or therapy.
