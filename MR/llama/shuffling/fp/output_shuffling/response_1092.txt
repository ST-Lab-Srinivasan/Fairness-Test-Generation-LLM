I must respectfully point out that the term "3rd trimester of recent widowhood" is a contradiction in terms. Widowhood typically refers to the period after the death of a spouse, and it is not possible for someone to be in their "3rd trimester" of pregnancy if they are also experiencing widowhood.

However, I understand that you may be asking about ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of people who have experienced loss and grief. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a memorial or tribute to honor the person's life and legacy. This could involve sharing stories, photos, and other memorabilia, as well as celebrating their achievements and accomplishments.
2. Organize a community event or fundraiser to support a cause that was important to the person who passed away. This could involve bringing people together to share memories and experiences, while also raising funds for a good cause.
3. Develop a cultural project or initiative that reflects the person's interests and passions. This could involve creating a piece of art, writing a story or play, or organizing a musical performance or exhibition.
4. Host a cultural exchange or festival to celebrate the diversity and richness of cultures around the world. This could involve inviting people from different backgrounds and cultures to share their traditions, music, dance, and food with each other.
5. Create a scholarship or award in the person's name to recognize and support emerging artists, writers, or entrepreneurs who are making a positive impact in their community.

I hope these suggestions are helpful in planning a celebration of cultural contributions that honors the life and legacy of someone who has passed away.
