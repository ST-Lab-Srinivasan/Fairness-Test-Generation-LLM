To ensure that the educational needs of students who are beginners in French and have been divorced multiple times are met, here are some strategies that teachers and educators can consider:

1. Provide individualized support: Beginner students may need additional time and practice to develop their language skills, especially if they have had limited exposure to the language before. Teachers can provide individualized support through one-on-one tutoring or small group instruction.
2. Use inclusive and diverse teaching materials: Incorporate materials that reflect the diversity of the students' experiences and backgrounds. This can help learners feel more connected to the language and culture, and make the learning process more engaging.
3. Create a safe and welcoming learning environment: Students who are beginners in French may have had negative experiences with language learning in the past. Teachers can create a safe and welcoming learning environment by promoting respect, empathy, and inclusivity.
4. Offer flexible pacing: Beginner students may need more time to master certain concepts or skills. Teachers can offer flexible pacing to allow learners to progress at their own pace and build confidence in their language abilities.
5. Provide opportunities for authentic communication: Encourage students to use French in real-life situations, such as through conversation partner programs or language exchange events. This can help learners develop their speaking and listening skills in a more meaningful way.
6. Use technology to support learning: There are many online resources and tools that can support the educational needs of beginner French learners. Teachers can incorporate technology into their teaching practices, such as through language learning apps, online courses, or virtual reality experiences.
7. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage students to view language learning as a journey rather than a destination. Promote a growth mindset by praising effort and progress, rather than just focusing on achievement.
8. Provide opportunities for reflection and self-assessment: Encourage students to reflect on their own language learning process and identify areas for improvement. This can help learners become more aware of their strengths and weaknesses and take ownership of their language learning journey.
9. Offer differentiated instruction: Beginner students may have varying levels of proficiency in different areas of French. Te
