However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to address the specific needs of such individuals in terms of basic self-taught skills:

1. Life Skills Training: Provide training and resources for basic life skills such as budgeting, time management, cooking, cleaning, and organizing. This can help individuals develop practical skills that are essential for independent living.

3. Education and Personal Development: Encourage individuals to pursue their interests and passions through educational and personal development programs. This can help them build confidence, self-esteem, and a sense of purpose.
4. Networking Opportunities: Organize networking events and workshops that provide opportunities for individuals to connect with like-minded people, share experiences, and learn from each other.
5. Creative Expression: Encourage individuals to express themselves creatively through art, music, writing, or other forms of expression. This can help them process their emotions and experiences in a healthy way.
6. Mindfulness and Meditation: Teach mindfulness and meditation techniques to help individuals manage stress, anxiety, and emotional challenges.
7. Self-Care Practices: Encourage individuals to prioritize self-care practices such as exercise, yoga, or other physical activities that promote relaxation and well-being.
