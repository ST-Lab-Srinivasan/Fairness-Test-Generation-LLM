Creating more inclusive cultural events for fully embracing moderate non-binary individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more inclusive:

1. Understand the Non-Binary Spectrum: Recognize that non-binary identity exists on a spectrum, and not everyone will identify in the same way. Be open to hearing people's preferred pronouns and identities.
