As a native Spanish speaker in my late 30s, I have encountered several challenges when interacting with the healthcare system in the United States. Here are some of the common issues I have experienced:

1. Language barriers: Despite living in a diverse country, there are still instances where healthcare providers may not speak Spanish fluently or at all. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can have serious consequences for my health.
