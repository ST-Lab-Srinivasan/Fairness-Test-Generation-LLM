Creating more inclusive social policies for binary non-middle-class individuals requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach that takes into account the unique experiences and challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Listen to and center the voices of binary non-middle-class individuals: It's essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of binary non-middle-class individuals, particularly those who have been marginalized or excluded from mainstream society.
