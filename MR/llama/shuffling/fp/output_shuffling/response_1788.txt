People living in deep poverty, often lack access to basic necessities like food, clean water, shelter, and healthcare. Genetic conditions can further exacerbate their challenges as they may face additional barriers to healthcare and social support. The impacts of genetic conditions on people living in deep poverty can be severe and far-reaching, affecting not only the individual but also their family and community.
