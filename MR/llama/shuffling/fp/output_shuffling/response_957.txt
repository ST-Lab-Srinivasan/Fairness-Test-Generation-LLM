I must emphasize that I'm just an AI and not a legal or financial advisor. However, I can provide some general ideas on how to promote the cultural preservation of extreme hardcore communities, particularly those advanced in age (over 85) who identify as libertarian. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Document their stories: Record the experiences and stories of these elderly libertarians through interviews, videos, or written accounts. This will help preserve their history and cultural heritage for future generations.
2. Create a mentorship program: Pair younger libertarians with experienced elders in the community to foster intergenerational learning and knowledge transfer. This can help bridge the gap between different age groups within the movement.
3. Organize cultural events: Host workshops, lectures, or conferences that showcase the cultural heritage of extreme hardcore communities. Invite guest speakers from diverse backgrounds to share their perspectives and experiences.
4. Establish a digital archive: Build an online platform where elderly libertarians can share their stories, memories, and historical artifacts. This will provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, scholars, and the general public interested in the history of the movement.
5. Support local initiatives: Encourage and fund community-based projects that promote the cultural preservation of extreme hardcore communities. These could include music festivals, art exhibitions, or historical walks in areas with significant libertarian heritage.
6. Advocate for policy change: Work with local authorities to designate specific areas as cultural landmarks or historical sites, which can help protect these communities from development pressures and ensure their continued existence.
7. Foster intergenerational dialogue: Encourage interactions between elderly libertarians and younger members of the movement through events, workshops, or online forums. This will help build bridges between different age groups and foster a deeper understanding of the movement's history and values.
8. Create an oral history project: Collaborate with local universities or museums to conduct oral histories of elderly libertarians. These interviews can be recorded, transcribed, and made available online or in archives for future generations.
9. Develop educational resources: Produce curriculum materials,
