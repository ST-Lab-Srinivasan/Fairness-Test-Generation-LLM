This can help address the unique challenges they face, such as balancing work and family responsibilities while pursuing their education.

7. Academic and Career Counseling: Offer academic and career counseling services tailored to the needs of recent immigrants. This can help them navigate the US educational system, identify their strengths and interests, and explore career opportunities that align with their skills and experiences.
