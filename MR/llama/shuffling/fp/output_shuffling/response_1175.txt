Creating more inclusive recreational activities for people who are not deeply in poverty can be achieved through a combination of several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local community centers, non-profit organizations, and social service agencies to reach a wider audience. These organizations may have existing relationships with low-income communities and can help promote the recreational activities to their networks.
2. Offer scholarships or sliding scale fees: Provide financial assistance to individuals who cannot afford the full cost of participation. This can include offering scholarships, sliding scale fees, or payment plans to make the activities more accessible.
3. Host events in underserved areas: Organize recreational activities in areas where there may be limited access to resources and opportunities. This can help bring the benefits of recreation to communities that are often overlooked.
4. Incorporate culturally relevant activities: Ensure that the recreational activities are inclusive and culturally relevant to the diverse populations you are trying to reach. This can involve incorporating elements of different cultures into the activities, or partnering with community leaders to ensure that the activities are responsive to local needs.
5. Provide transportation and childcare: Offer transportation and childcare services to help individuals overcome barriers to participation. This can include organizing bus trips, providing carpooling options, or offering on-site childcare during events.
6. Promote activities through multiple channels: Use a variety of marketing channels to reach a wider audience. This can include leveraging social media, partnering with local schools and community organizations, and advertising in local publications.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Incorporate opportunities for older adults to mentor or participate alongside younger individuals. This can help build intergenerational connections and foster a sense of community among participants.
8. Offer adaptive equipment and accommodations: Provide adaptive equipment and accommodations for individuals with disabilities, including wheelchairs, walkers, and accessible restrooms. This can help ensure that everyone has access to the recreational activities.
9. Provide language support: Offer language support services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to ensure that individuals who are limited English proficient can participate
