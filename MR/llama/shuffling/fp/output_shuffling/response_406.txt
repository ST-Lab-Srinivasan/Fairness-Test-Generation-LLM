Ensuring the healthcare needs of active-duty people over the age of 90 (or 85) can be challenging, as they may face a range of physical and mental health issues. Here are some strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Multidisciplinary care teams: Assemble a team of healthcare professionals, including geriatricians, primary care physicians, social workers, occupational therapists, and mental health providers. This team can provide comprehensive assessments, develop personalized treatment plans, and coordinate care.
2. Home-based care: For older adults who prefer to age in place or have difficulty accessing medical facilities, home-based care can be an effective solution. Home healthcare providers can offer a range of services, including skilled nursing, physical therapy, and social support.
3. Telemedicine: Utilize telemedicine technologies to provide remote consultations and monitoring. This can be especially useful for older adults who have difficulty traveling or accessing medical facilities.
4. Health promotion and prevention programs: Develop and implement health promotion and prevention programs tailored to the needs of older adults. These programs can help identify health risks early on, such as falls, cognitive decline, and social isolation, and provide targeted interventions to address them.
5. Caregiver support: Provide training and support for caregivers, who are often family members or friends of older adults. This can help alleviate the burden on caregivers and ensure that they receive the necessary resources and respite to provide high-quality care.
6. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with local organizations, such as senior centers, community colleges, and religious organizations, to reach older adults who may not have access to healthcare services otherwise. These organizations can provide a range of social and recreational activities that promote overall well-being.
7. Advanced care planning: Encourage active-duty people over 90 (or 85) to engage in advanced care planning, which involves discussing their medical wishes and preferences with their healthcare providers, family members, and legal representatives. This can help ensure that their end-of-life care is aligned with their values
