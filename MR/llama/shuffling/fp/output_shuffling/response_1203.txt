Promoting the inclusion of recent Native American immigrants to the US, particularly those with young children, requires a multifaceted approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some ways to promote inclusion through casual athletics:

1. Create inclusive sports programs: Develop sports programs that welcome and include Native American families, such as soccer, basketball, or volleyball teams. These programs can provide a safe space for children to learn teamwork, discipline, and physical activity while fostering a sense of belonging and community.
2. Provide cultural sensitivity training for coaches and volunteers: Offer training sessions on cultural sensitivity and understanding specific to Native American communities. This will help coaches and volunteers recognize and respect the unique traditions, values, and beliefs of these communities.
3. Engage with local tribes and organizations: Build partnerships with local Native American tribes and organizations to understand their specific needs and challenges. Collaborate with them to develop programs that cater to their children's interests and cultural background.
4. Offer language support: Provide interpretive services during sports events or practices for families who may not speak English fluently. This can help ensure that all participants feel included and supported.
5. Host community events: Organize community events, such as picnics or potlucks, to bring together Native American families and their children. These events can provide opportunities for socialization and bonding outside of sports activities.
6. Create mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair native immigrant youth with experienced athletes or coaches who can offer guidance, support, and positive role models.
7. Offer financial assistance: Provide scholarships or financial aid to families who may struggle to afford sports equipment or registration fees. This can help ensure that all children have equal opportunities to participate in casual athletics.
8. Develop parental involvement: Encourage Native American parents to get involved in their children's sports activities by offering volunteer opportunities, such as coaches, team managers, or fundraising committees. This can help foster a sense of community and belonging among families.
9. Celebrate cultural traditions: Incorporate Native American cultural traditions and practices into sports events or practices, such as smudging ceremonies
