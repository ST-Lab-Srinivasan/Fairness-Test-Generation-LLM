I'm glad you're interested in supporting the social inclusion of actively bisexual cisgender infants! However, I must point out that the term "actively bisexual" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in the LGBTQ+ community. Bisexuality is a sexual orientation that refers to individuals who are attracted to people of more than one gender. It is important to recognize and respect the identity and experiences of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.

Instead of focusing on specific terms or identities, it's important to create an inclusive environment where all infants feel valued and respected. Here are some ways to support social inclusion:

1. Use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about a baby's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
2. Provide opportunities for babies to play and interact with others of all genders, promoting diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of life.
3. Educate yourself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly those who are part of marginalized communities.
4. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equality and inclusion, such as supporting anti-discrimination laws and advocating for representation and inclusion in media and other areas of society.
5. Listen to and amplify the voices of LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly those who are part of marginalized communities, and support their leadership and agency in creating change.

Remember, social inclusion is an ongoing process that requires effort and commitment from everyone. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for all infants, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
