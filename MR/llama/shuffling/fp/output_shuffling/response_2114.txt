3. Student voice and choice: Encourage AA students to take an active role in their education by providing opportunities for student voice and choice. This includes allowing students to choose topics for assignments, projects, and presentations that are relevant to their lives and experiences.
4. Inclusive assessment practices: Develop inclusive assessment practices that consider the unique strengths and challenges of AA students. This includes providing accommodations and modifications that address individual needs and abilities.
5. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship and support to AA students, particularly those who may be navigating academic and social challenges. This can include pairing students with peers or educators who share similar experiences and backgrounds.
6. Cultural competence training: Offer cultural competence training for educators and administrators to help them better understand the needs of AA students and how to support them effectively.
7. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local African American communities and organizations to provide opportunities for students to engage in community-based learning and to access resources and supports that can enrich their educational experiences.
8. Relevant and inclusive curriculum: Develop and implement a curriculum that is relevant and inclusive of AA history, culture, and experiences. This includes incorporating diverse perspectives and voices into the curriculum and promoting critical thinking and reflection on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
