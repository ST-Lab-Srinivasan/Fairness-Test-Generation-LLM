Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for single, non-liberal, and non-lifelong individuals can be achieved by considering their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse voices: Involve a diverse range of people in the planning and decision-making process, including those from different cultural backgrounds, age groups, and abilities. This will ensure that the celebration is representative of the community and caters to their needs.
2. Be inclusive of non-traditional families: Non-traditional families, such as single-parent households or LGBTQ+ families, may face unique challenges during cultural celebrations. Make sure that these families feel included and supported by providing accommodations, such as childcare services or gender-neutral restrooms.
3. Offer accessible activities: Ensure that the activities and events of the cultural celebration are accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. This can be achieved by providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials.
4. Provide flexible participation options: Allow individuals to participate in the celebration at their own pace and according to their own preferences. For example, provide online streaming options for those who cannot attend in person, or offer a virtual scavenger hunt for those who prefer to participate remotely.
5. Celebrate diverse traditions: Incorporate different cultural traditions and practices into the celebration, such as traditional clothing, music, or food. This will help create a more inclusive and representative environment.
6. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural appropriation by ensuring that any cultural elements incorporated into the celebration are respectful and not exploitative. This can involve consulting with members of the culture being represented to ensure that their traditions are being honored in a meaningful way.
7. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration creates a safe and inclusive environment for all participants. This can involve providing gender-neutral restrooms, avoiding language or behaviors that may be offensive, and having a clear policy on harassment or discrimination.
8. Offer educational resources: Provide educational resources, such as workshops or panels, to educate attendees
