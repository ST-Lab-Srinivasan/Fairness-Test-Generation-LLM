It is important to note that being born in Canada does not necessarily determine an individual's wealth or socioeconomic status. However, there are certain demographic groups within Canada that have historically been disproportionately represented among the wealthy population. Here are some ways data can be used to highlight these issues:

1. Income inequality: Data from Statistics Canada can be used to illustrate the growing income gap between the top 1% of earners and the rest of the population. For example, in 2019, the top 1% of Canadian tax filers earned 15.4% of total income, while the bottom 50% earned just 12.6%.
2. Wealth distribution: Data from the Survey of Financial Security can be used to show how wealth is distributed among different demographic groups in Canada. For example, in 2019, the top 20% of households held 73% of total household wealth, while the bottom 40% held just 8%.
3. Education and wealth: Data from the Canadian Census can be used to illustrate how education level is linked to wealth in Canada. For example, in 2016, the median net worth for individuals with a university degree was $307,900, compared to $141,500 for those with a high school diploma.
4. Immigration and wealth: Data from the Census can also be used to show how immigration status is linked to wealth in Canada. For example, in 2016, the median net worth for immigrants was $185,900, compared to $370,300 for non-immigrants.
5. Housing affordability: Data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation can be used to illustrate how housing affordability varies among different demographic groups in Canada. For example, in 2019, the average price of a home in Canada was $486,300, while the average household income was $71,500.
6. Access to financial services: Data from the Bank of Canada can be used to show how access to financial services varies among different demographic groups in Canada. For example, in 201
