It is important to recognize that the experiences of African-American people in the healthcare system can vary greatly based on factors such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare resources, and cultural background. Here are some challenges that may be faced by African-American people who are ethnically full but non-upper-class in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to healthcare: African-Americans may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to financial constraints or lack of transportation, which can result in delayed or inadequate care.
2. Health disparities: African-Americans are more likely to experience health disparities, such as higher rates of chronic diseases, poorer health outcomes, and lower life expectancy compared to other racial groups.
3. Bias and discrimination: Discrimination and bias within the healthcare system can lead to unequal treatment and a lack of culturally competent care, which can result in poorer health outcomes for African-American patients.
4. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the patient population, leading to a lack of cultural understanding and representation for non-white patients.
5. Language barriers: For African-Americans who are non-upper class, language barriers can be a significant challenge, particularly if they do not speak English fluently or have limited access to interpreters and translators.
6. Limited health literacy: Non-upper-class African-Americans may have limited health literacy, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complex healthcare system, understand their treatment options, and make informed decisions about their care.
7. Mistrust of the medical system: Historical abuses and discrimination within the medical system can lead to mistrust and skepticism among African-Americans, making it challenging for them to seek or receive appropriate care.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Non-upper-class African-Americans may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or other subspecialists, which can result in delayed or inadequate treatment.
9. Insurance and financial barriers: Non-upper-class African-Americans may face insurance and financial bar
