I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular racial or ethnic group. Cultural diversity can enrich the lives of individuals from any background, and it is important to recognize that all people have inherent value and deserving of respect and dignity regardless of their race or ethnicity.

It is also important to recognize that socioeconomic status and access to resources can impact an individual's quality of life, and that lower middle-income individuals from any racial or ethnic background may face unique challenges. However, it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about people based on their race or ethnicity.

Instead, we should strive to create a society that values and embraces diversity, and works to address the systemic inequalities that can limit the opportunities and resources available to individuals from marginalized communities. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, and working to dismantle racism and discrimination in all its forms.

In short, cultural diversity can enrich the lives of any individual, regardless of their race or ethnicity, and it is important to work towards creating a society that values and respects all individuals equally.
