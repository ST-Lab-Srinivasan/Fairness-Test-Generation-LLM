I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on social class. Every individual, regardless of their socioeconomic status, has the right to access quality healthcare. The United States has a complex healthcare system, and ensuring that the needs of all citizens are met is a multifaceted challenge. Here are some strategies that could help:

1. Improve access to health insurance: Ensure that all citizens have access to affordable health insurance, regardless of their income level. This can be achieved by expanding Medicaid programs, creating more affordable private insurance options, or implementing a single-payer system.
2. Invest in preventive care: Encourage primary care and preventive services to help identify health issues early on, reducing the likelihood of costly interventions later on. This can be achieved through increased funding for community health centers, public health programs, and medical education reform.
3. Promote health equity: Address disparities in healthcare access and outcomes by implementing targeted interventions that focus on underserved populations. This can involve culturally sensitive care, language access services, and addressing social determinants of health such as housing, food security, and transportation.

This can involve referral pathways, shared care plans, and coordinated care management.
5. Leverage technology: Utilize digital health technologies such as telemedicine, mobile health apps, and electronic health records to improve access to care and streamline care delivery. These tools can help bridge gaps in care and reduce disparities in healthcare access.
6. Support community-based care: Invest in community-based care models that prioritize patient-centered, holistic care. This can involve partnerships with community organizations, non-profits, and faith-based groups to provide comprehensive care beyond the clinical setting.
