I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their background, should have equal opportunities and be treated with dignity and respect. The concept of an "upper upper class" is also problematic, as it implies a hierarchy of wealth and status that can lead to social exclusion and inequality.

Instead of focusing on the economic empowerment of specific racial or ethnic groups, it is important to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and inequalities, such as discrimination, unequal access to education and job training, and limited access to capital and credit.

There are many ways to support the economic empowerment of individuals from marginalized communities, including:

1. Providing access to education and job training programs that help individuals develop the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market.
2. Offering financial assistance, such as loans or grants, to help individuals start businesses or invest in their future.
3. Advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as fair hiring practices and anti-discrimination laws.
4. Supporting community-based organizations that provide resources and support to marginalized communities.
5. Encouraging diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and working to dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination.

Ultimately, the goal should be to create a society where everyone has equal opportunities to succeed, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. By working towards this goal, we can build a more just and equitable society for all.
