Highlighting the issues faced by recent immigrants to the US, including native French speakers, requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach that takes into account the complex experiences and challenges of this population. Here are some ways data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Mapping immigration patterns: Use geospatial data to map the locations where recent immigrants have settled in the US. This can help identify clusters of immigrant populations and reveal trends in immigration patterns over time.
2. Collecting survey data: Conduct surveys among recent immigrants to gather information on their experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Survey questions can be tailored to capture the specific issues faced by native French speakers, such as language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination.
3. Analyzing employment data: Examine labor market data to identify industries and occupations that are more likely to hire immigrants, and analyze wage and employment trends among recent immigrant groups.

This can help identify areas where immigrants face barriers to academic success or where they are underrepresented in certain fields.
6. Monitoring discrimination: Use data from surveys or administrative records to monitor instances of discrimination against recent immigrants, including hate crimes and employment discrimination. This can help identify areas where immigrant populations face significant barriers to integration.
7. Examining housing data: Analyze data on housing affordability and access to quality housing among recent immigrants. This can help identify areas where immigrants face challenges in finding affordable and secure housing.
8. Investigating criminal justice data: Examine data on immigration status and criminal justice outcomes, including rates of
