Losing a spouse can be one of the most challenging experiences in life, especially for recently widowed native Chinese speaker students who may face additional cultural and linguistic barriers. As educators, it is crucial to identify and address their unique educational needs to help them navigate this difficult time. This article provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the educational needs of recently widowed native Chinese speaker students are met.
