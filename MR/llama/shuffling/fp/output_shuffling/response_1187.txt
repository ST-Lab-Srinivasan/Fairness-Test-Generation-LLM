As a beginner Spanish speaker, there are several ways you can support independent people in promoting social inclusion:

1. Practice active listening: When engaging with someone who is not fluent in Spanish, make an effort to actively listen and respond to their messages. This will help them feel heard and valued, and can help build trust and rapport.
2. Use simple language: Avoid using complex or formal language that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Instead, use simple and clear language that is easy to comprehend.
3. Offer support: If someone is struggling with a particular concept or phrase, offer to help them practice or provide additional support. This can include providing corrected sentences or phrases, or even just offering encouragement and positive reinforcement.
4. Encourage participation: Make an effort to involve beginners in group conversations or activities, even if it's just for a few minutes at a time. This can help them feel more included and valued, and can also help build their confidence in using the language.
5. Be patient: Learning a new language can be challenging, especially for beginners. Be patient and understanding when they make mistakes or struggle with certain concepts.
6. Provide feedback: If someone is making progress, provide positive feedback and encouragement to help them feel motivated and confident in their abilities.
7. Use visual aids: Using visual aids such as pictures or videos can help beginners learn new vocabulary and grammar concepts more easily.
8. Create a supportive environment: Encourage a supportive and inclusive atmosphere where beginners feel comfortable practicing their Spanish skills.
9. Offer opportunities to practice: Provide opportunities for beginners to practice their Spanish skills in real-life situations, such as ordering food at a restaurant or participating in a cultural event.
10. Celebrate progress: Celebrate the progress that beginners make, no matter how small it may seem. This can help build their confidence and motivation to continue learning.

By following these tips, you can help support independent people as they learn Spanish and promote social inclusion.
