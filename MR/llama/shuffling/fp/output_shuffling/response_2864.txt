2. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Avoid using cultural elements or symbols that are sacred or meaningful to other cultures without proper understanding, permission, or credit. Be respectful of cultural differences and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing harmful power dynamics.
3. Create a safe space: Ensure that your event is free from discrimination, harassment, and bullying. Create a code of conduct that outlines expectations for behavior and provides clear guidelines for reporting any incidents.

8. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for individuals to connect
