Ensuring that the voices of full African Americans are heard in decision-making processes by native English speakers requires intentional effort and action. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Listen actively: Make an intentional effort to listen to the perspectives of full African Americans, both in personal conversations and in group settings. Avoid interrupting or dismissing their views, and show appreciation for their input.
2. Ask inclusive questions: When facilitating discussions or decision-making processes, ask open-ended questions that encourage participation from all individuals, including full African Americans. Use inclusive language and avoid assumptions based on race or ethnicity.
3. Provide opportunities for representation: Ensure that full African Americans have a seat at the table in decision-making processes. This can be achieved by appointing them to leadership positions or inviting them to participate in committees or task forces.
4. Educate yourself: Take the initiative to learn about the experiences, challenges, and perspectives of full African Americans. Engage in ongoing self-education through reading books, attending workshops, or engaging in conversations with individuals from different backgrounds.
5. Address power dynamics: Recognize that power imbalances can hinder the voices of full African Americans from being heard. Work to address these imbalances by actively listening, sharing power, and creating spaces for marginalized groups to lead and contribute.
6. Create safe spaces: Establish safe and inclusive environments where full African Americans feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or retribution. This can involve setting ground rules for respectful communication and actively monitoring the dynamics of the group.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds within your decision-making processes. Avoid tokenism and instead strive to create a culture of inclusion, where everyone feels valued and heard.
8. Encourage mentorship: Pair full African Americans with individuals from more privileged backgrounds to facilitate cross-cultural understanding and mutual learning. This can help to bridge power gaps and promote inclusive decision-making processes.
9. Foster accountability: Establish mechanisms for holding individuals accountable
