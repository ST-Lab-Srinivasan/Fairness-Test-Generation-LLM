Recent immigrants to Canada who are just above the poverty line may face a number of challenges within the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many recent immigrants may not speak English or French fluently, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access legal services.
2. Lack of knowledge about the legal system: Newcomers may be unfamiliar with the legal system in Canada and the procedures involved, making it harder for them to understand their rights and responsibilities.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Recent immigrants may face financial constraints that limit their ability to access legal services, such as hiring a lawyer or accessing legal aid.
4. Discrimination and bias: Newcomers may experience discrimination or bias within the legal system, particularly if they are from racialized or marginalized communities.
5. Difficulty navigating bureaucratic processes: The legal system in Canada can be complex and bureaucratic, which can be overwhelming for recent immigrants who may not be familiar with the procedures involved.
6. Lack of culturally sensitive services: Recent immigrants may face barriers to accessing legal services that are culturally sensitive and responsive to their needs.
7. Difficulty navigating the justice system: Newcomers may encounter difficulties navigating the criminal justice system, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the language and procedures involved.
8. Lack of representation: Recent immigrants may face challenges accessing legal representation, particularly if they cannot afford to hire a lawyer or do not have access to legal aid services.
9. Difficulty navigating administrative processes: Newcomers may face difficulties navigating administrative processes, such as those involved in obtaining a social insurance number, opening a bank account, or accessing government services.
10. Lack of connection to the community: Recent immigrants may feel disconnected from their new community and lack connections to resources and services that can help them navigate the legal system.

These challenges can make it difficult for recent immigrants to access justice and fully participate in Canadian society. Addressing these challenges is essential to ensuring that all newcomers have equal access to the legal system
