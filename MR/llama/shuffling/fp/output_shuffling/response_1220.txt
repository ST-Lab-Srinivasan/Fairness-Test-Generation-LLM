I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that there is a distinct group of "extreme ultra-liberal beginner English speakers." Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of individuals and communities, regardless of their political beliefs or proficiency in English. It is essential to recognize that cultural heritage is not exclusive to any particular group and that it can unite people across borders and identities.

Cultural heritage encompasses various aspects of a community's history, traditions, and practices, including language, religion, customs, arts, and architecture. It is a vital part of people's identity and can shape their beliefs, values, and behaviors. Cultural heritage can also serve as a source of pride, inspiration, and belonging among individuals and communities.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not static or monolithic. It is constantly evolving and adapting to changing social, political, and economic contexts. Moreover, cultural heritage can be contested and complex, reflecting the diverse perspectives and experiences of different communities.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of individuals and communities worldwide, regardless of their political beliefs or proficiency in English. It is essential to approach cultural heritage with sensitivity, respect, and an open mind, recognizing its diversity and complexity.
