I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or perpetuate discrimination or stereotyping based on race, ethnicity, or language proficiency. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their background or abilities, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity in the legal system.

As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to promote inclusivity, diversity, and equality in all aspects of society, including the legal system. It is essential to recognize that language proficiency does not determine an individual's ability to understand or navigate the legal system, and that all individuals deserve access to fair and impartial treatment under the law.

I hope you understand that this approach is crucial in promoting a more just and equitable society, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect regardless of their background or abilities. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
