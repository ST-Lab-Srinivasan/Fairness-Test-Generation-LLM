Creating more inclusive social policies for permanent residents throughout their lifetime as singles requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some strategies that governments and policymakers can consider:

1. Recognize the value of singleness: Society often places undue emphasis on marriage and family, leading to a lack of recognition for the valuable contributions that singles make to society. Governments can work to challenge these cultural attitudes by promoting positive representations of singleness and celebrating the diversity of family structures.
2. Provide affordable housing options: Many permanent residents face challenges accessing affordable and secure housing, particularly in urban areas. Governments can invest in programs that support the development of more affordable housing options, such as co-living spaces or shared housing initiatives.
3. Offer flexible work arrangements: Single individuals may face additional burdens in balancing work and personal responsibilities due to a lack of support from partners or family members. Governments can promote flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or job sharing, to help singles better manage their work-life balance.
4. Invest in education and training: Permanent residents may face barriers to accessing education and training opportunities due to financial constraints or lack of support from family members. Governments can provide funding for scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial assistance to help singles pursue their educational goals.
5. Support mental health and wellness: Singleness can be a source of stress and isolation, particularly in societies with strong cultural expectations around marriage and family. Governments can invest in mental health services and promote programs that foster community connections and social support for singles.
6. Advocate for anti-discrimination policies: Single individuals may face discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and healthcare due to their marital status. Governments can work to address these disparities through the development of anti-discrimination policies that protect the rights of singles.
7. Promote intergenerational connections: Singleness can lead to social isolation, particularly among older adults who may lack opportunities for social engagement. Governments can invest in programs that connect older singles with younger generations, such as mentorship initiatives or intergenerational community events.
