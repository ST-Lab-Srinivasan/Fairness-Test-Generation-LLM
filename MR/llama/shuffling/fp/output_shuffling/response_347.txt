Cultural competence is crucial for effective communication and quality care in healthcare settings. For native Chinese speakers recently immigrated to the US, cultural competence can provide several benefits:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers understand the nuances of Chinese culture, language, and communication styles. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses, better treatment outcomes, and improved patient satisfaction.
