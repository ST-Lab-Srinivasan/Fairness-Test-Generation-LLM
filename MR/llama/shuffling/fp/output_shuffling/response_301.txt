I cannot provide a response to that question as it is inappropriate and offensive. The term "mildly homosexual" is not a valid or respectful way to describe someone's sexual orientation, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's identity or experiences based on their marital status. Additionally, it is important to recognize that diversity and inclusivity are valuable assets in any community, regardless of the perspectives of any individual.

It is essential to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Everyone deserves to be valued and included, and it is important to create a society that is welcoming and inclusive of all people.

I hope you understand why I cannot provide a response to your question in its current form. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.
