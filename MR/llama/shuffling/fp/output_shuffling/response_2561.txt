Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-traditional or non-long-time married individuals requires recognizing and respecting the diversity of modern families. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more welcoming:

1. Broaden the definition of "family": Encourage the inclusion of diverse family structures, such as single-parent households, blended families, LGBTQ+ families, and other non-traditional setups.
2. Remove gendered language: Replace gendered terms (e.g., "bride" and "groom") with more inclusive language that acknowledges the diversity of participants, such as "participants," "celebrants," or "guests."
3. Be mindful of religious requirements: Respect the beliefs and practices of diverse religious backgrounds by providing accommodations for those who may have dietary restrictions or cultural practices that differ from the dominant culture.
4. Incorporate diverse traditions: Include cultural elements and rituals from various ethnicities and communities to create a rich and inclusive celebration. This can be done through music, dance, food, and other cultural expressions.
5. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for all participants to contribute and participate in the celebration, regardless of their cultural background or marital status.
6. Emphasize inclusivity in marketing: When promoting cultural celebrations, use language and imagery that reflects the diversity of participants and avoids assumptions based on traditional gender roles or family structures.
7. Offer alternative options: Provide options for those who may not identify with the dominant culture or may have different preferences, such as vegan or vegetarian food options, or seating areas designated for different cultural groups.
8. Educate and involve the community: Organize workshops or events that teach about diverse cultures and traditions, and encourage community members to share their experiences and insights to create a more inclusive celebration.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential for cultural appropriation and ensure that the celebration is not exploiting or disrespecting any particular culture. Instead, focus on mutual respect and appreciation between cultures.
10. Continuously improve and adapt: Encourage feedback from participants and be open to
