Art and literature can play a significant role in helping us understand the experiences of children who are expecting, as they provide a platform for expression and communication. Here are some ways in which art and literature can aid in this understanding:

1. Empathy building: Through art and literature, we can gain insight into the emotions and thoughts of children who are expecting. By depicting their experiences, feelings, and struggles, these mediums help us build empathy and understanding towards them.

By depicting diverse experiences and perspectives, these mediums can help break down barriers and promote inclusivity.
