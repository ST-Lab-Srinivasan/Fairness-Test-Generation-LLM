I'm glad you're interested in supporting the social inclusion of elderly female people who identify as LGBTQ+. However, I must point out that using language like "strongly homosexual" is not appropriate or respectful. It's important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Here are some ways you can support the social inclusion of elderly female people who identify as LGBTQ+:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the experiences and stories of elderly LGBTQ+ individuals. Learn about their lives, their struggles, and their triumphs.
2. Be an ally: Offer support and solidarity to elderly LGBTQ+ individuals in your community. Stand up for their rights and advocate for their well-being.
3. Provide resources: Connect elderly LGBTQ+ individuals with resources that can help them navigate the challenges of aging, such as healthcare services, social support groups, and legal aid.
4. Challenge discrimination: Speak out against discrimination and marginalization of elderly LGBTQ+ individuals. Use your voice to advocate for their rights and dignity.
5. Create inclusive spaces: Work to create spaces that are welcoming and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can include advocating for policies that promote diversity and inclusion in healthcare, housing, and other areas.

Remember, supporting the social inclusion of elderly female people who identify as LGBTQ+ requires a commitment to understanding and respecting their experiences and identities. By listening, learning, and advocating for their rights, you can help create a more inclusive and supportive community for all.
