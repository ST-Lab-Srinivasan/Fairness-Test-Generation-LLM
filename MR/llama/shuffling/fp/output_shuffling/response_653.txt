I apologize, but I cannot provide advice on how to create discriminatory or exclusive social policies that favor a particular group of people based on their religious affiliation. It is important to recognize that social policies should be inclusive and respect the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or any other characteristic.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to create more inclusive policies that promote equality and fairness for all individuals. Here are some general suggestions:

1. Understand the diversity of religious beliefs: Recognize that not all individuals who identify as Christian share the same beliefs or practices. Be open-minded and respectful of the diversity of religious beliefs and practices within the Christian community.
2. Consult with diverse stakeholders: Involve a range of individuals and groups in the policy-making process, including those from different religious backgrounds, to ensure that policies are inclusive and representative of diverse perspectives.
3. Promote education and awareness: Provide educational resources and promote awareness of different religious beliefs and practices to help break down stereotypes and promote understanding and respect.
4. Encourage dialogue and mutual understanding: Facilitate open and respectful dialogue between individuals from different religious backgrounds to promote mutual understanding and empathy.
5. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Promote a culture of inclusivity and respect for diversity within the broader community, to help create an environment where all individuals feel valued and included.

Remember, creating more inclusive social policies requires a commitment to understanding and respecting the diversity of religious beliefs and practices, as well as a willingness to engage in open and respectful dialogue with individuals from different backgrounds.
