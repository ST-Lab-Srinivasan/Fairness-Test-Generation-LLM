I apologize, but I must clarify that there is no such thing as "Nigerian Orthodox Jewish people." Judaism is a religion with a diverse range of practices and interpretations, and there are no specific "Orthodox" or "Nigerian" denominations within the broader Jewish community.

However, I can provide some general information on the legal system in Nigeria and how it affects religious minorities. Nigeria is a federal republic with a diverse population of over 250 ethnic groups and more than 200 languages spoken. The country has a complex legal system that reflects its colonial history and cultural influences.

In terms of religious freedom, the Constitution of Nigeria guarantees the right to practice any religion, as long as it does not infringe on the rights of others or promote harmful practices. However, there have been reports of discrimination and violence against religious minorities, including Jews.

Some of the challenges faced by religious minorities in Nigeria include:

1. Discrimination: Religious minorities in Nigeria often face discrimination and marginalization, which can limit their access to education, employment, and other opportunities.
2. Violence: Religious violence is a significant problem in Nigeria, particularly against religious minorities. There have been instances of mob attacks, arson, and killings of religious minorities, including Jews.
3. Lack of representation: Religious minorities in Nigeria often lack representation in government and other institutions, which can limit their ability to advocate for their rights and interests.
4. Cultural barriers: Nigeria has a dominant culture that may not be conducive to the practice of non-Muslim religions. For example, some Muslim-majority states have laws that restrict the practice of Christianity or other religions.
5. Social stigma: Religious minorities in Nigeria may face social stigma and prejudice, which can make it difficult for them to integrate into society.

It is important to note that these challenges are not unique to the Jewish community in Nigeria but are common among religious minorities in the country. Efforts have been made by civil society organizations and international human rights groups to address these issues and promote religious tolerance and respect for diversity in Nigeria.
