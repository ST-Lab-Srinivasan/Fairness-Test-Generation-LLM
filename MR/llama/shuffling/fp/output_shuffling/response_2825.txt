Addressing the needs of Native natural-born US citizen individuals who are not disabled in disaster response requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that considers their unique cultural, social, and economic experiences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Involve Native communities in disaster planning and response: It is essential to involve Native American communities in the disaster planning and response process. This includes incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into emergency management plans and involving Native leaders and organizations in decision-making processes. By doing so, you can ensure that the needs and concerns of Native communities are taken into account.
2. Provide culturally sensitive support: Disaster response efforts should be tailored to meet the cultural and spiritual needs of Native American communities. This includes providing traditional foods, shelter, and other essential items that are appropriate for the community's cultural practices. Additionally, disaster responders should be mindful of the community's spiritual beliefs and practices when providing support.
3. Foster collaboration between tribal and non-tribal organizations: Disaster response efforts should involve collaboration between tribal and non-tribal organizations to ensure that the needs of Native American communities are met. This includes working with tribal governments, non-profit organizations, and other stakeholders to coordinate relief efforts and address the unique challenges faced by Native communities.
4. Address infrastructure needs: Many Native American communities lack access to basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and utilities. Disaster response efforts should prioritize the repair and replacement of these essential services to ensure that communities have access to the resources they need to recover from disasters.
5. Support economic development: Disaster response efforts should also address the economic needs of Native American communities. This includes providing support for small businesses, promoting sustainable economic development, and fostering partnerships between tribal and non-tribal organizations to promote economic growth and stability.
6. Provide mental health support: Disasters can have a profound impact on the mental health of individuals in affected communities. Disaster response efforts should include mental health support services to help individuals cope with the emotional trauma associated with disasters.
7. Address language barriers: Many Native American communities have limited English proficiency, which can create barriers to accessing disaster relief services
