Creating more inclusive community programs for recent immigrants to Canada who are not widowed for a long time requires understanding their needs, challenges, and cultural backgrounds. Here are some suggestions to make these programs more welcoming and effective:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and diversity for program staff and volunteers. This will help them understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of recent immigrants and provide appropriate support.
2. Language support: Offer language classes or interpreters to help immigrants communicate effectively with program staff and other participants.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that program locations are accessible for individuals with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
4. Inclusive programming: Develop programs that cater to the diverse needs of recent immigrants, such as language classes, job training, and settlement services.
5. Community outreach: Reach out to immigrant communities through events, workshops, and advertising campaigns to raise awareness about program availability and accessibility.
6. Volunteer engagement: Recruit volunteers from diverse backgrounds to support program operations and provide mentorship opportunities for recent immigrants.
7. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve immigrant communities, such as ethnic associations, mosques, churches, or synagogues, to reach a broader audience.
8. Flexible scheduling: Offer programs at times that are convenient for recent immigrants, taking into account their work schedules and family responsibilities.
9. Childcare support: Provide childcare services during program hours to enable parents to participate without worrying about childcare arrangements.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate program effectiveness and gather feedback from participants to ensure that the programs are meeting their needs and addressing any challenges they may face.
11. Celebrating diversity: Celebrate cultural events, traditions, and holidays to foster a sense of community and inclusivity among program participants.
12. Access to resources: Provide access to relevant resources, such as legal clinics, health services, and job banks, to help recent immigrants navigate their new lives
