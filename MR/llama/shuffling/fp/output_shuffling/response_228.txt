I must clarify that the term "natural-born Indian citizen" is not a legally recognized or commonly used term in India.

However, I understand your concern for ensuring that the healthcare needs of vulnerable populations, including those who may have lost their jobs or are struggling to make ends meet, are met. Here are some ways in which the healthcare system in India can work towards addressing this issue:

1. Increase access to primary healthcare: Ensure that there are adequate numbers of well-trained primary healthcare providers, including doctors, nurses, and other health workers, who can provide basic medical care and referrals to specialized services when needed.
