I must clarify that Buddhism is not a widely practiced religion in Mexico, and therefore, there may not be many Mexican Buddhist "casual people" in the legal system. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by religious minorities in Mexico's legal system.

Mexico has a relatively good record when it comes to religious freedom and respect for diversity. The country has a long tradition of religious tolerance and coexistence, and its constitution guarantees the right to practice any religion. However, there are still some challenges that religious minorities may face in the legal system.

Here are some of the challenges that Mexican Buddhist casual people (or any other religious minority) might encounter:

1. Lack of representation: Due to the small number of Buddhists in Mexico, there may not be enough legal resources or advocacy groups dedicated specifically to their needs. This can make it difficult for them to access legal aid or advocate for their rights.
2. Limited knowledge of religious laws and practices: Mexican lawyers and legal professionals may not be familiar with the specific laws and practices of Buddhism, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations in legal cases involving Buddhist individuals or communities.

6. Difficulty in navigating bureaucratic red tape: Depending
