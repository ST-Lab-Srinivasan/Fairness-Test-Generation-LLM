Nigeria's healthcare system faces numerous challenges that affect the country's elderly population, particularly those who have reached the age of 65. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Many parts of Nigeria lack adequate healthcare infrastructure, making it difficult for older adults to access quality medical care, especially in rural areas.
2. Financial barriers: Older adults may face financial difficulties in affording medical care, as many are living on a fixed income and struggle to cover the costs of treatment, medication, and other healthcare expenses.
3. Limited availability of geriatric care: Nigeria has a limited number of specialized geriatric care facilities, which can result in older adults receiving suboptimal care or being unable to access appropriate services.
4. Brain drain: Many skilled healthcare professionals have left Nigeria to seek better opportunities abroad, leading to a shortage of trained staff in the country's healthcare system.
