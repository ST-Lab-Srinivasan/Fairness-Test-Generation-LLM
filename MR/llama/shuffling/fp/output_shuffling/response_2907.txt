I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic discrimination. Celebrating the cultural contributions of any group of people should be done in a respectful and inclusive manner, without promoting harmful stereotypes or marginalizing other groups.

Instead of focusing on the "ethnic fullness" of individuals, it's important to recognize and appreciate the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all people. Here are some ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of independent African-American people without perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination:

1. Learn about and appreciate the history and culture of African Americans, including their struggles and achievements. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, and engaging in respectful dialogue with members of the community.
2. Support independent African-American artists, writers, musicians, and other creatives by attending their performances, purchasing their work, and sharing their content with others.
3. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as diversifying workplaces, schools, and other institutions. This can involve advocating for hiring practices that prioritize diverse candidates, providing mentorship opportunities for underrepresented groups, and promoting inclusive curricula in education.
4. Engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with members of the African-American community, listening to their experiences and perspectives without judgment or assumptions. This can involve attending community events, participating in discussions, and engaging in respectful conversations on social media.
5. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about independent African-American people based on their race or ethnicity. Instead, get to know them as individuals with unique experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of any group should be done in a respectful and inclusive manner that promotes understanding, empathy, and mutual appreciation.
