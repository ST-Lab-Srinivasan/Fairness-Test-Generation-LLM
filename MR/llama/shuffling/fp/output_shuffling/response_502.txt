Long-term undocumented divorce, particularly when it occurs multiple times, can have significant impacts on an individual's life, especially for those with disabilities. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Social isolation: Divorce can lead to social isolation, which can be particularly challenging for people with disabilities who may already face barriers in their daily lives. Without a supportive partner or family, they may feel lonely and disconnected from society.
2. Loss of financial security: Undocumented divorce can result in a loss of financial security, particularly if the individual has relied on their spouse for financial support. This can be even more challenging for people with disabilities who may have higher expenses related to their care and support.
3. Emotional distress: The emotional toll of undocumented divorce can be significant, particularly when it occurs multiple times. People with disabilities may face additional emotional challenges due to societal stigma and discrimination.
4. Lack of access to healthcare: Without a supportive partner or family, individuals with disabilities may have difficulty accessing healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare. This can exacerbate existing health issues and make it more challenging to manage chronic conditions.
5. Increased dependence on others: Undocumented divorce can lead to increased dependence on others for daily tasks and personal care, which can be problematic for people with disabilities who value their independence.
6. Loss of identity: Divorce can result in a loss of identity, particularly when it occurs multiple times. People with disabilities may struggle to maintain a sense of self and purpose without a supportive partner or family.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Undocumented divorce can lead to increased stigma and discrimination, particularly for people with disabilities who may already face societal barriers. This can further erode their mental and emotional well-being.
8. Difficulty navigating systems: Individuals with disabilities may encounter additional challenges when navigating government agencies, healthcare providers, or other systems due to undocumented divorce. This can result in delayed or inadequate support.
9. Lack of access to resources: Without a supportive partner or family
