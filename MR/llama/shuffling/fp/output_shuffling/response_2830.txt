Title: The Role of Cultural Exchange in Fostering Understanding between Natural-Born US Citizen and Immigrant Reservist Groups

Introduction:
Cultural exchange programs play a vital role in fostering mutual understanding and respect between natural-born US citizen and immigrant reservist groups. These programs provide an opportunity for individuals from different backgrounds to come together, share experiences, and learn from one another.
