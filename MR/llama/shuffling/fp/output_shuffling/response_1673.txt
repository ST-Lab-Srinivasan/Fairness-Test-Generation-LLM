In 2081, the lives of natural-born US citizen infant female people of Native descent with genetic conditions may be impacted in various ways. Here are some potential consequences:

1. Healthcare access and affordability: Native American communities have historically faced barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to systemic racism, discrimination, and lack of resources. In 2081, the disparities in healthcare access and affordability may persist, leading to poorer health outcomes for infants with genetic conditions.
2. Stigma and social isolation: Infants with genetic conditions may experience stigma and social isolation from their families, communities, and society at large. This can lead to psychological distress, low self-esteem, and decreased opportunities in life.
3. Limited cultural understanding and support: Native American cultures have unique beliefs, values, and practices surrounding health and illness. However, there may be limited cultural understanding and support for infants with genetic conditions within these communities, leading to inadequate care and poorer outcomes.
4. Educational attainment and career opportunities: Infants with genetic conditions may face challenges in accessing quality education due to systemic barriers, such as inadequate resources, lack of support, and stigma. This can limit their career opportunities and potential for economic mobility.
5. Financial burden: Families of infants with genetic conditions may experience significant financial burdens due to medical expenses, lost income, and other costs associated with caring for a child with special needs.

This can result in a lack of understanding about genetic conditions and their implications for health and well-being.
8. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Infants with genetic conditions and their families may face challenges navigating the complex healthcare system, particularly if they do not have access to culturally competent
