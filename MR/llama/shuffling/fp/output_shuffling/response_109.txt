Creating more inclusive cultural events for single civilian individuals who are recent immigrants or refugees requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct research to understand the cultural backgrounds, values, and preferences of the single civilian individuals you want to engage. This will help you tailor your events to their specific needs and interests.
2. Provide language support: Offer translation services or interpretation during events to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the content. This can include providing printed materials in multiple languages, using visual aids, or hiring interpreters.
3. Incorporate cultural elements: Infuse cultural elements from the target audience's background into the event, such as music, dance, food, or decorations. This will help them feel more comfortable and connected to the event.
4. Offer childcare and transportation: Many single civilian individuals may have children or face challenges with transportation. Provide childcare services or organize transportation options to ensure that everyone can attend the events without stress.
5. Create a welcoming environment: Train staff and volunteers on how to create a welcoming environment for newcomers, including being sensitive to their cultural practices and beliefs.
6. Involve the community: Engage with local communities and organizations to co-create events that are inclusive and representative of the diverse population. This can include collaborating with cultural centers, festivals, or community groups.
7. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that the event space is accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, or audio descriptions.
8. Offer diverse programming: Plan events that cater to a variety of interests and preferences, such as language classes, cultural workshops, or social gatherings. This will help single civilian individuals find activities that resonate with them.
9. Use technology: Utilize digital platforms to reach a wider audience, provide virtual events or activities, or offer online resources for those who cannot attend in person.
10. Evaluate and improve: Continuously assess the effectiveness of your events and gather feedback from attendees to identify areas for improvement. This will help you refine your approach
