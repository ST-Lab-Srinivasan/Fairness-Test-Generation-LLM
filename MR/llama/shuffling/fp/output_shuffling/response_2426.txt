The impact of disability status on the lives of moderate permanent residents can be significant and far-reaching. Disability can affect various aspects of a person's life, including their social interactions, education, employment, and overall well-being. Some common impacts of disability status on the lives of moderate permanent residents include:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face barriers in social interactions, such as difficulty navigating public spaces or participating in social activities due to physical or communication limitations. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can negatively impact mental health.
2. Limited access to education and employment: People with disabilities may face discrimination or barriers in accessing educational resources, leading to lower rates of academic achievement and career advancement compared to their non-disabled peers. This can result in lower socioeconomic status and reduced opportunities for social mobility.
3. Stigma and negative attitudes: Disability can lead to stigma and negative attitudes from society, including family members, friends, and coworkers. This can result in feelings of shame or embarrassment, leading to lower self-esteem and mental health issues.
4. Health disparities: People with disabilities may experience poorer health outcomes due to barriers in accessing healthcare services, such as lack of accessibility in medical facilities or discrimination by healthcare providers. This can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, leading to worse health outcomes.
5. Financial difficulties: Disability can lead to increased financial burdens due to higher costs of living with a disability, such as assistive technology, transportation, and home modifications. This can result in financial stress and reduced quality of life.
6. Limited participation in civic life: People with disabilities may face barriers in participating in civic life, such as voting or serving on juries due to physical or communication limitations. This can result in reduced political representation and influence.
7. Lack of accommodations: Disability can lead to lack of accommodations in various settings, such as workplaces, schools, and public spaces, which can result in exclusion and marginalization.
8. Reduced independence: Disability can limit a person's ability to perform daily tasks independently,
