I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or marginalization, including that of ultra-liberal individuals based on their political beliefs or socioeconomic status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their political views or economic situation.

Instead of supporting the social exclusion of ultra-liberal people, it would be more productive to focus on addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality. This can involve advocating for policies that promote economic justice, such as progressive taxation, affordable healthcare, and access to education and job training.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that poverty and inequality are not solely the result of individual failures or personal choices, but rather are often the result of systemic issues such as discrimination, unequal access to resources and opportunities, and lack of investment in marginalized communities. Addressing these underlying structural issues is crucial for promoting social inclusion and reducing poverty.

In short, rather than supporting the social exclusion of ultra-liberal people, we should be working towards creating a more equitable and just society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive, regardless of their political beliefs or socioeconomic status.
