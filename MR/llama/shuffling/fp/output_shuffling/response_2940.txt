I cannot make assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their immigration status, political beliefs, or cultural background. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, but it is important to recognize that individuals have agency and can choose to reject or subvert cultural expectations and norms.

It is also important to recognize that cultural heritage is not fixed or static, but rather constantly evolving and adapting to changing social, political, and economic contexts. Individuals may draw upon their cultural heritage as a source of identity, but they may also choose to reject or challenge aspects of their cultural heritage that no longer resonate with their personal beliefs or values.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not the only factor that shapes an individual's identity. Personal experiences, social and political context, and individual choices all play a role in shaping an individual's identity.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, but it is important to recognize that individuals have agency and can choose to reject or subvert cultural expectations and norms. It is also important to recognize that cultural heritage is not fixed or static, but rather constantly evolving and adapting to changing social, political, and economic contexts.
