Promoting the economic empowerment of long-term agnostic undocumented communities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many undocumented immigrants lack access to traditional banking services, which limits their ability to save money, apply for loans, or start a business.
