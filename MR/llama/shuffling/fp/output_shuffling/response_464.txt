Supporting the professional aspirations of newly married individuals without known genetic conditions can be done through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage them to pursue their career goals: Marriage is a significant life milestone, but it doesn't have to hinder one's professional ambitions. Encourage your friends to continue pursuing their career goals and provide support in any way you can.
2. Offer to help with household chores: Newly married couples often have a lot on their plate, including managing a new home and raising a family. Offer to help with household chores or errands to give them more time to focus on their careers.
3. Provide childcare support: If your friends are expecting or have young children, offer to babysit or provide other childcare services to give them some respite. This can help them balance work and family responsibilities.
4. Be a sounding board for career ideas: Sometimes, all someone needs is someone to talk to about their career aspirations. Offer to listen to your friends' ideas and provide feedback or suggestions.
5. Help them find job opportunities: If your friends are looking for new job opportunities, offer to help them search for openings or provide connections to people in their desired field.
6. Encourage work-life balance: Marriage and starting a family can be challenging, especially when it comes to balancing work and family responsibilities. Encourage your friends to prioritize self-care and work-life balance to avoid burnout.
7. Offer financial support: Newly married couples may face financial strain, especially if they are starting a family. Offer financial support or help them create a budget that works for their needs.
8. Help them navigate new responsibilities: Marriage and starting a family can bring new responsibilities, such as managing a household and raising children. Offer to help your friends navigate these new responsibilities and provide guidance when needed.
9. Be a supportive friend: Above all, be a supportive friend. Listen to your friends' concerns and celebrate their successes. Offer emotional support during challenging times and be there for them whenever they need you.
