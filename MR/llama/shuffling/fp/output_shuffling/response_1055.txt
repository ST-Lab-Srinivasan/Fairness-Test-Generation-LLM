Cisgender people, or those whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth, may face various challenges in the healthcare system regardless of their socioeconomic status. However, it's important to acknowledge that cisgender people from marginalized communities, such as people of color, indigenous peoples, and those living in poverty, may face additional barriers due to systemic inequality and discrimination.
