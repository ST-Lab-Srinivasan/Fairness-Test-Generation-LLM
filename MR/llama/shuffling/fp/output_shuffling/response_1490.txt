I must clarify that the term "wealthy multimillionaire" is subjective and can be perceived as discriminatory.

1. Fondation Jean-Pierre et Annie Fauvergue: This foundation was established by Jean-Pierre and Annie Fauvergue, a French couple who donated a significant portion of their wealth to support various charitable causes in France and around the world. The foundation focuses on supporting disadvantaged youth, promoting education, and providing aid to vulnerable populations.
2. Association des Parents d'Enfants à Tumeurs Cérébrales (APETC): This organization was founded by a group of parents who had children diagnosed with brain tumors. They came together to provide emotional support and financial assistance to families affected by the disease. The APETC also raises awareness and funds research to improve treatments and find a cure for brain tumors.
3. La Machine Citoyenne: This is a grassroots organization that aims to promote civic engagement and political participation among young people in France. The initiative was founded by a group of passionate individuals who wanted to create a platform for young people to have their voices heard in the political sphere.
4. Les Restos du Coeur: This is a French charity organization that provides food and support to people in need, particularly during the holiday season.

The organization focuses on providing scholarships, mentorship programs, and cultural events to promote education and cultural exchange between France and other countries.
