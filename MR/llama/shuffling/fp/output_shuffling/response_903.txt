Mentorship can play a significant role in the success of lower-class individuals, particularly those from marginalized groups. Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Access to opportunities: Mentors can provide access to resources and opportunities that may not be available to lower-class individuals otherwise. This could include networking events, job shadowing experiences, or even access to scholarships and grants.
2. Guidance and support: A mentor can offer guidance and support in navigating the challenges of lower-class life. They can provide emotional support, help with goal setting, and offer practical advice on how to overcome obstacles.
3. Role modeling: Mentors can serve as role models, demonstrating what is possible for individuals from lower-class backgrounds. By seeing someone who has succeeded despite similar challenges, mentees may feel more motivated and empowered to achieve their own goals.
4. Building confidence: A mentor can help build the confidence of a lower-class individual by recognizing their strengths and potential. This can be particularly important for individuals who may have internalized negative messages about their worthiness or ability to succeed.
5. Networking: Mentors can introduce mentees to their own professional networks, providing access to valuable connections and opportunities. This can help lower-class individuals gain exposure to new career paths and opportunities that they may not have considered otherwise.
6. Advocacy: A mentor can advocate for the mentee within their own organization or community. This could involve securing funding or resources, or simply providing a voice for the mentee's needs and concerns.
7. Personalized support: A mentor can offer personalized support based on the individual needs of the mentee. For example, they may provide additional academic support, help with time management skills, or offer advice on how to navigate workplace dynamics.
8. Cultural brokering: Mentors from diverse backgrounds can provide a unique perspective and understanding of different cultural norms and expectations. This can be particularly helpful for lower-class individuals who may face discrimination or marginalization within their own communities.
9. Developing resilience: A mentor can help develop the resilience and coping skills of a lower-class individual by sharing
