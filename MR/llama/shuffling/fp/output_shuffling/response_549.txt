Addressing the Needs of Non-Conservative Individuals in Disaster Response:

Disaster response and recovery efforts often focus on providing essential services to conservative, traditional families. However, it is crucial to recognize that non-conservative individuals, such as those who identify as LGBTQ+, genderqueer, or non-binary, may face unique challenges during a disaster.

Develop identification processes that do not require gender classification or assumptions about an individual's identity.

Ensure that non-conservative individuals are not marginalized or prioritized over others based on their identity. Develop strategies to reach individuals who may be harder to reach due to their location or accessibility challenges.
