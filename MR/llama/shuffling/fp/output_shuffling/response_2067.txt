As a responsible AI language model, I appreciate your interest in promoting inclusivity and accessibility for marginalized groups, including beginner Arabic speakers. Here are some potential legislative changes that could benefit these communities:

1. Language Education Funding: Provide adequate funding for language education programs, particularly those focused on non-dominant languages like Arabic. This could include initiatives to hire more language teachers, provide language learning materials, and support language immersion programs.
2. Employment Protections: Enact laws that protect job applicants and employees from discrimination based on their language proficiency. This could include anti-discrimination measures, such as banning employers from asking about an applicant's language skills during the hiring process or penalizing them for doing so.
3. Cultural Events Support: Offer funding and resources to support cultural events that showcase Arabic culture and language. This could include festival grants, artist residencies, and language exchange programs.
4. Public Transportation Accessibility: Ensure that public transportation systems are equipped with bilingual signage (Arabic and English) to facilitate access for non-native speakers. Additionally, provide audio announcements in both languages to help visitors navigate the system more easily.
5. Healthcare Services: Require healthcare providers to offer language support services, such as interpreters or translated medical materials, to ensure that non-native speakers can receive adequate care. This could also involve training for healthcare professionals on cultural competency and linguistic diversity.
6. Voting Rights: Protect the right to vote for non-native speakers by ensuring that polling stations are equipped with bilingual materials (Arabic and English) and providing interpretive services at polling stations upon request.
7. Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance programs for individuals seeking language education, such as scholarships or grants. This could help cover the costs of language classes, language learning materials, and other expenses associated with language acquisition.
8. Community Resources: Establish community centers or libraries that offer Arabic language resources, including books, CDs, DVDs, and online materials. These resources could also include cultural events, workshops, and language exchange programs.
