I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or unequal treatment based on an individual's religious beliefs, including those of hardcore socialist Muslim individuals. It is important to recognize that everyone has the right to practice their religion and to have their housing needs met in a fair and respectful manner, regardless of their beliefs.

Instead of focusing on specific religious groups, it may be more productive to consider ways to ensure that all individuals have access to safe and affordable housing. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote inclusivity, diversity, and respect for the beliefs and practices of all communities.

Some potential strategies could include:

1. Inclusive zoning regulations: Ensure that zoning regulations are written in a way that allows for a diverse range of housing options to be developed, including those that cater to different religious and cultural groups.
2. Affordable housing initiatives: Implement programs that prioritize the development and preservation of affordable housing, particularly in areas with high demand and low supply.
3. Community land trusts: Consider establishing community land trusts, which allow community members to collectively own land and make decisions about how it is used, rather than relying on private developers.
4. Inclusionary zoning: Require that new developments include a certain percentage of affordable housing units, and ensure that these units are accessible to individuals from a range of cultural and religious backgrounds.
5. Education and outreach: Provide educational resources and outreach efforts to help community members understand the importance of inclusive zoning and the benefits of diversity in housing options.

Ultimately, it is important to recognize that ensuring the housing needs of all individuals are met requires a commitment to equity, justice, and respect for the beliefs and practices of all communities. By prioritizing inclusivity and diversity in housing policies and practices, we can work towards creating more equitable and resilient communities for everyone.
