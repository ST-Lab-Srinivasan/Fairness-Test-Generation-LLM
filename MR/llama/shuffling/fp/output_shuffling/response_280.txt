Immigrants in the United States, particularly those in their third trimester of pregnancy or who have been long-term widowed, face significant challenges that can have profound impacts on their lives. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Immigrants may encounter difficulties when accessing healthcare services, particularly during their third trimester of pregnancy. They may face language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination, which can result in delayed or inadequate prenatal care. This can lead to adverse birth outcomes and other health problems for both the mother and baby.
2. Fear of Deportation: The fear of deportation can be a significant stressor for immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented or have temporary protection status. This fear can cause anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues, which can negatively impact their overall well-being during pregnancy.
3. Limited Social Support: Immigrants may face challenges when seeking support from family and friends due to cultural and language barriers. They may also experience discrimination and stigma from their social networks, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness.
4. Financial Stress: Immigrants may struggle with financial insecurity, particularly those who are undocumented or have limited access to financial resources. This can lead to stress and anxiety during pregnancy, which can negatively impact the mother's mental and physical health.
5. Lack of Education and Resources: Immigrants may have limited access to education and resources, such as prenatal care, childbirth classes, and parenting support. This can result in a lack of knowledge and skills for navigating the healthcare system, caring for themselves and their baby during pregnancy and after birth.
6. Cultural and Language Barriers: Immigrants may face challenges when trying to access healthcare services due to cultural and language barriers. They may not speak the dominant language in their area or have limited knowledge of local customs and practices, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Immigrants may experience discrimination and stigma from healthcare providers, which can lead to feelings of shame and embarrass
