Creating more inclusive social policies for newly married couples who have been in poverty for many years requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and provides support for these individuals to build a better life. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Increase access to education and job training: Many newly married couples lack access to quality education and job training, which hinders their ability to secure decent jobs and escape poverty. Governments can invest in initiatives that provide vocational training, entrepreneurship programs, and scholarships for skills development.
2. Implement microfinance programs: Microfinance programs provide small loans and other financial services to individuals who lack access to traditional banking services. These programs can help newly married couples start small businesses or invest in income-generating activities, such as livestock rearing or craft-making.
3. Provide affordable housing options: Many newly married couples struggle to find affordable and decent housing, which can exacerbate poverty. Governments can provide subsidies for housing construction or repair, or invest in community land trusts that make affordable housing available to low-income families.
4. Strengthen social safety nets: Social safety nets, such as cash transfers and food assistance programs, can provide a critical layer of support for newly married couples who are struggling to make ends meet. These programs can help them pay for basic needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter.
5. Promote gender equality: Many newly married couples face gender-based discrimination and violence, which can hinder their ability to escape poverty. Governments can promote gender equality by investing in programs that address these issues, such as women's empowerment initiatives, gender-based violence prevention, and legal aid services.
6. Address health disparities: Newly married couples may face health challenges due to lack of access to quality healthcare. Governments can invest in community health programs, provide subsidies for health insurance, or build health facilities in underserved areas.
7. Foster community support networks: Building strong community networks can help newly married couples access emotional and practical support, such as childcare, transportation, and household tasks. Governments can invest in community development programs that
