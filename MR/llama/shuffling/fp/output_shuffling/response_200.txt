As an empathetic, culturally sensitive, and socially unbiased assistant, I appreciate your interest in creating more inclusive cultural events for fully asexual individuals who are recently naturalized citizens. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Avoid assumptions: Avoid making assumptions about someone's sexual orientation based on their gender identity or expression. Remember that asexuality is a valid and legitimate identity, and it's important to respect people's privacy and agency when it comes to sharing personal information.
2. Be inclusive in marketing: When promoting cultural events, be sure to use language that is inclusive of all gender identities and expressions. Avoid using language that assumes everyone is cisgender (their sex assigned at birth matches their gender identity) or heterosexual. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all identities.
3. Provide accommodations: For cultural events that involve sensory experiences, such as festivals or parades, provide accommodations for asexual individuals who may not want to participate in activities that involve touching or close proximity. This could include designated areas for people who prefer not to participate in these activities or staff trained to help facilitate these accommodations.
4. Create safe spaces: Consider creating safe spaces for asexual individuals to connect and socialize without feeling uncomfortable or pressured to participate in activities that don't align with their identity. This could include designated areas at cultural events or online communities.
5. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to educate yourself and others about asexuality and the experiences of asexual individuals. Share information and resources on social media, in presentations, or in workshops to help create a more inclusive environment.
6. Engage with asexual communities: Reach out to asexual communities and engage with them in a respectful and considerate manner. Listen to their experiences and perspectives, and be open to feedback and suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural events.
7. Be patient and understanding: Remember that creating a more inclusive environment takes time and effort. Be patient and understanding when working with asexual individuals, and be willing to adapt and make changes as needed.
