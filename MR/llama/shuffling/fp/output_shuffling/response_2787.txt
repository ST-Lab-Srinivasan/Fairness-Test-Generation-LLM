Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not in a relationship can be achieved by recognizing the unique challenges and needs of this group. Here are some recommendations:

1. Addressing the "single tax": One of the biggest challenges faced by single people is the so-called "single tax," or the idea that singles pay more in taxes than married couples, even though they may have lower incomes. Policymakers can address this issue by implementing progressive taxation policies that ensure fairness and equity for all individuals, regardless of their marital status.
2. Increasing access to affordable housing: Single people often face challenges when it comes to finding affordable and secure housing. Policymakers can work to increase the supply of affordable housing options, such as rent control policies, subsidized housing programs, and incentives for developers to build more affordable units.
3. Improving access to healthcare: Single people may face challenges when it comes to accessing quality healthcare, particularly if they are not covered under a spouse's insurance plan. Policymakers can work to improve access to affordable healthcare options, such as expanding Medicaid eligibility or implementing a public option.
4. Enhancing retirement savings options: Single people often have fewer resources for retirement savings than married couples, who may have access to employer-sponsored retirement plans and other sources of retirement income. Policymakers can work to enhance retirement savings options for singles, such as automatic enrollment in retirement plans or matching contributions from employers.
5. Supporting financial literacy and capability: Single people may face unique financial challenges, such as managing debt, saving for retirement, and navigating the complexities of financial planning. Policymakers can work to support financial literacy and capability among singles by providing access to financial education programs, promoting financial planning resources, and encouraging financial planning in schools.
6. Addressing social isolation: Single people may be at higher risk for social isolation and loneliness, which can have negative impacts on mental and physical health. Policymakers can work to address this issue by investing in programs that promote social connection and community building, such as intergenerational housing
