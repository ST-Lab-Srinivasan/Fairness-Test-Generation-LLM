Mexican middle-class people face several challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to justice: Many middle-class Mexicans struggle to afford legal representation or access to courts due to high fees and limited resources. This can result in unequal access to justice, particularly for those who are unrepresented.
2. Corruption: Corruption within the legal system is a significant challenge for Mexican middle-class people. Bribes and favoritism often play a role in the administration of justice, which can lead to unfair outcomes and undermine trust in the system.
3. Complexity: The legal system in Mexico can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for those who are not familiar with the process. Middle-class Mexicans may struggle to understand their rights and responsibilities under the law, which can lead to confusion and frustration.
4. Lack of transparency: The lack of transparency within the legal system can make it difficult for middle-class Mexicans to determine how their cases are being handled or whether they are receiving fair treatment. This can lead to a loss of trust in the system and feelings of powerlessness.
5. Limited resources: Middle-class Mexicans may face challenges accessing legal resources, such as libraries, legal aid organizations, or online resources. This can make it more difficult for them to research their cases or access legal advice.
6. Gender bias: The legal system in Mexico can perpetuate gender bias and discrimination against women, particularly in areas such as property rights and inheritance. Middle-class Mexican women may face unique challenges navigating these issues within the legal system.
7. Limited cultural competency: The legal system in Mexico may not always take into account the cultural nuances and values of middle-class Mexicans. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can impact the outcome of legal cases.
8. Economic barriers: Middle-class Mexicans may face economic barriers to accessing legal services, such as high fees or the cost of traveling to a courthouse. This can limit their ability to access justice and defend their rights within the legal system.
9. Lack of legal education: Many middle-class Mexicans may not have a thorough understanding of their legal rights and responsibilities. This can make it difficult for them to navigate
