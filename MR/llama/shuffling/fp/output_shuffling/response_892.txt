Introduction:
Marriage is an important life event that can have significant social, economic, and emotional implications for the individuals involved. When a couple immigrates to a new country during their early pregnancy, they may face additional challenges related to their marital status. This paper will explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently immigrated to Canada individuals with early pregnancy (1st trimester).

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marital status can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of immigrants. For example, studies have found that married immigrants tend to have better mental and physical health outcomes compared to unmarried immigrants (1,2). Marriage can also provide a sense of security and stability, which can be particularly important during pregnancy.

However, the impact of marital status on recently immigrated individuals with early pregnancy may be more complex. Some studies have found that immigrant women may experience delays in prenatal care due to language barriers or cultural beliefs (3,4). Additionally, the stress of immigration and adjusting to a new environment can negatively impact mental health during pregnancy (5,6).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, employing in-depth interviews with 20 recently immigrated individuals who are currently in their first trimester of pregnancy. Participants will be purposely selected to represent diverse marital statuses (married, unmarried, common-law), ages, and countries of origin. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, with thematic analysis used to identify key patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Findings:
This study will provide insight into the experiences and challenges faced by recently immigrated individuals with early pregnancy, including the impact of marital status on their lives. Specifically, we expect to find that married individuals may have better access to prenatal care and social support compared to unmarried individuals. However, we also anticipate that cultural beliefs and language barriers may pose challenges for all participants, regardless of marital status.

Conclusion:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between marital status and
