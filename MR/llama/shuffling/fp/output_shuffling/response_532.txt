Native American natural-born US citizens face unique challenges within the healthcare system, particularly those who are unemployed. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Native Americans often live in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities and specialized care. This can result in delayed or lack of access to necessary medical treatment, which can exacerbate chronic conditions and lead to poorer health outcomes.
2. Cultural barriers: The healthcare system can be unfamiliar and unwelcoming to Native Americans, who may have different cultural beliefs and practices related to health and illness. Healthcare providers may not be aware of or sensitive to these differences, leading to misunderstandings and mistrust.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages, which can create a barrier to communication with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in those languages. This can lead to miscommunication or a lack of understanding of the patient's needs and concerns.

This can result in misunderstandings or misinterpretations of medical advice or treatment plans.
