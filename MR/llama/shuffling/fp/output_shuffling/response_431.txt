Creating more inclusive community events for deeply lower-class native English speakers requires careful consideration of their needs and experiences. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Assess the location and accessibility: Choose a venue that is easily accessible for people with mobility issues, has ample parking, and is located in a safe and familiar area for the target audience.
2. Offer childcare and transportation: Provide free or low-cost childcare and transportation options to ensure that participants can attend without worrying about these logistical challenges.
3. Use inclusive language and materials: Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to your audience. Use clear, simple language and provide materials in a variety of formats, such as braille, large print, or audio versions, to accommodate different learning styles.
4. Provide interpreters and translators: Offer interpreters and translators for participants who may not speak English fluently or at all. This can include sign language interpretation, live translation via headsets, or pre-recorded interpretations in multiple languages.
5. Offer financial support: Consider offering financial support, such as scholarships or reduced registration fees, to participants who may face economic barriers to attending your events.
6. Engage with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve lower-class communities to help promote your events and ensure that they are inclusive and accessible to a diverse range of people.
7. Focus on themes that resonate with the community: Choose event themes and topics that are relevant and meaningful to the target audience, such as healthcare access, education, or economic empowerment.
8. Involve community members in planning and decision-making: Encourage community members to participate in event planning and decision-making processes to ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account.
9. Provide accessible food and drink options: Offer food and drink options that are culturally appropriate and accessible to people with dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free, vegetarian, or halal options.
10. Follow up after the event: Show appreciation for participants' attendance by following up after the event with a survey or feedback form to gather their thoughts
