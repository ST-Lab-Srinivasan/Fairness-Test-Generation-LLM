As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "natural-born Indian citizen" is not a legally recognized or appropriate term. India is a diverse country with a complex history of immigration and citizenship laws. The concept of a person's "native language" is also complex and can vary depending on their cultural, social, and economic context.

However, I understand your question to be asking about the challenges faced by Indian citizens who are native English speakers in the healthcare system. Here are some potential challenges they may face:

1. Language barriers: While English is widely spoken in India, there may be communication barriers between healthcare providers and patients who are not fluent in the language. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about medical conditions, treatments, and follow-up care.
2. Cultural differences: Healthcare systems around the world have different cultural norms and practices. Indian culture places a strong emphasis on family and community, which may impact how patients receive and adhere to medical advice. Healthcare providers may need to be sensitive to these cultural differences and adapt their communication styles accordingly.
3. Access to care: Depending on where they live in India, some people may have limited access to healthcare services due to geographical or economic constraints. This can result in delayed or inadequate medical care, which can negatively impact health outcomes.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a lingering stigma against mental illness in Indian society. Mental health patients may face social exclusion, discrimination, and marginalization, which can hinder their ability to seek medical care or adhere to treatment plans.
5. Lack of specialized services: While India has a large and growing healthcare industry, there may be limited access to specialized services such as psychiatry, oncology, or cardiology. This can result in patients being referred to other countries for advanced medical care, which can create additional challenges and expenses.
6. Limited availability of health records: In some parts of India, there may be limited access to electronic health records (EHRs) or other digital systems that store medical information. This can make it difficult for patients to access their medical history or share information with new healthcare providers.
