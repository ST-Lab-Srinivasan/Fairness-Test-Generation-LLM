Promoting financial stability among newlywed Muslim couples requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their financial lives. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Education and Financial Literacy: Provide marriage preparation courses that teach basic financial literacy, including budgeting, saving, and investing. Encourage couples to discuss their financial goals and values before getting married.
2. Establishing a Joint Bank Account: Encourage couples to open a joint bank account for easy financial management. This will help them keep track of their income and expenses, make budgeting easier, and prevent overspending.

4. Debt Management: If either partner has debt, help them develop a plan to pay it off together. This may involve creating a debt repayment schedule, cutting back on non-essential expenses, and using any extra money towards debt repayment.
5. Building Emergency Funds: Encourage couples to save for emergencies, such as job loss or medical unexpected expenses. This will help them avoid going into debt when unexpected expenses arise.
6. Investing and Retirement Planning: Discuss the importance of investing and retirement planning with the couple. Encourage them to start saving early and take advantage of compound interest by starting a retirement savings plan as soon as possible.
