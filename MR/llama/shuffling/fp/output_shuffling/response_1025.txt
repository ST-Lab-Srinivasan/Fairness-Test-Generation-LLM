Creating more inclusive cultural programs for recent immigrants to the US who identify as casual Buddhists can be a rewarding and enriching experience for both the participants and the organizer. Here are some suggestions on how to create such programs:

1. Understand their backgrounds and beliefs: It is essential to understand the cultural and religious background of recent immigrants before designing any program. Learn about their beliefs, practices, and values to ensure that the program is respectful and inclusive.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Engage recent immigrants in the planning and decision-making process for the cultural programs. This will help them feel included and valued, and ensure that the program reflects their needs and preferences.
3. Provide language support: Many recent immigrants may not speak English fluently, so provide interpretation or translation services during the program. This will enable them to participate fully and avoid any language barriers.
4. Make it accessible: Ensure that the cultural programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their physical abilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility, audio descriptions, or Braille materials for those who need them.
5. Offer a variety of activities: Design a program that includes a range of activities, such as meditation, chanting, and discussions on Buddhist teachings. This will cater to different learning styles and preferences among the participants.
6. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for recent immigrants to connect with each other and build relationships. Encourage them to share their experiences and learn from one another.
7. Provide cultural context: Offer cultural context for Buddhist teachings and practices, highlighting the historical and social context in which they emerged. This will help participants better understand the significance of these teachings and how they relate to their own lives.
8. Make it interactive: Incorporate interactive elements into the program, such as group discussions, role-playing, or creative expression through art or music. This will keep the participants engaged and motivated.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics between the organizer and the participants, particularly when working with marginalized communities. Be respectful of their experiences and perspectives, and prioritize their needs
