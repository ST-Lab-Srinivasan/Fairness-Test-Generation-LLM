I must emphasize that it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about a person's mental or physical abilities based on their religious affiliation. People of all backgrounds and belief systems have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, and to be included in society without discrimination.

That being said, there are several ways that you can support the social inclusion of nominal Christian people who are mentally able-bodied:

1. Treat them with respect and dignity: Avoid making assumptions about someone's abilities based on their religion or any other personal characteristic. Instead, treat them as individuals with their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and experiences.
2. Engage in inclusive language and behaviors: Use language and behave in ways that are inclusive of all people, regardless of their religious beliefs. Avoid using language that is derogatory or offensive to any particular group.
3. Provide access to resources and opportunities: Ensure that nominal Christian people have access to the same resources and opportunities as other members of society. This can include educational and job opportunities, as well as access to healthcare and social services.
4. Challenge ableism and discrimination: Speak out against ableism and discrimination against nominal Christian people or any other group. Use your voice to advocate for their rights and dignity.
5. Support inclusive policies and practices: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusion and respect for the diversity of all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs.
6. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by nominal Christian people, and share that knowledge with others to promote greater understanding and empathy.
7. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that any spaces or events you are a part of are inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs.
8. Support marginalized communities: Many marginalized communities face discrimination and exclusion based on their religion, race, gender, sexuality, or other factors. Supporting these communities and advocating for their rights can help promote greater inclusion and respect.
9. Engage in dialogue and listening: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of nominal Christian people, and engage in open and respect
