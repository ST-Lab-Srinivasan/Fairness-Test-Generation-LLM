As a beginning Chinese speaker and a soft libertarian, there may be several challenges you face within the legal system. Here are some potential obstacles:

1. Language Barrier: As a non-native Chinese speaker, you may struggle to understand complex legal terminology and procedures, which can hinder your ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
2. Cultural Differences: China has a unique cultural context that may differ significantly from your own. This could lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications, particularly when dealing with legal concepts that are culturally relative.
3. Limited Access to Information: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may have limited access to legal resources and information, such as case law, statutes, and regulations. This can make it difficult to stay informed about legal developments and changes in the law.
4. Difficulty Interpreting Laws: China's legal system is based on a civil law tradition, which may be unfamiliar to soft libertarians who are used to common law systems. You may struggle to interpret laws and regulations, particularly if they are written in complex language or use legal terminology that is unfamiliar to you.
5. Limited Legal Protections: Soft libertarians may find that China's legal system does not provide the same level of protection for individual rights as their own legal system. This could lead to difficulties when seeking legal remedies or defending yourself against legal challenges.
6. Difficulty Navigating Bureaucracy: China's legal system is known for its complexity and bureaucracy, which can be challenging for beginners to navigate. You may encounter difficulties in filing legal documents, appearing in court, or accessing legal services due to language barriers or unfamiliarity with the legal process.
7. Conflicts with Chinese Laws: As a soft libertarian, you may have different values and beliefs about individual rights and freedoms than those enshrined in China's legal system. This could lead to conflicts between your personal beliefs and the legal framework, which could be challenging to navigate.
8. Limited Legal Recourse: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may find that there are limited legal remedies available to you if you encounter legal issues. This could be due to language barriers or unfamiliarity
