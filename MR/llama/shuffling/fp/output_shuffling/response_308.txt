Supporting recently arrived Native American families in their third trimester of pregnancy can be a challenging but rewarding experience. Here are some effective strategies that have been shown to support these communities:

1. Culturally responsive care: Provide prenatal and postnatal care that is culturally responsive and sensitive to the unique needs and practices of Native American communities. This may involve incorporating traditional healing practices, such as smudging or singing, into medical care.
2. Access to language support: Many Native American families may not speak English fluently, which can create barriers to accessing healthcare services. Providing interpreters or translation services can help overcome these barriers and ensure that families receive the care they need.
3. Addressing historical trauma: Many Native American communities have experienced historical trauma related to colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression. Addressing this trauma through mental health support and community-based interventions can help build resilience and promote positive outcomes for mothers and their families.
4. Community engagement: Building relationships with local Native American communities and engaging in ongoing dialogue can help identify specific needs and develop culturally appropriate interventions. This may involve collaborating with tribal leaders, elders, and community members to design programs that are responsive to the unique challenges facing these communities.
5. Capacity building: Building the capacity of local healthcare providers and organizations can help ensure that they have the skills and resources needed to provide high-quality care to Native American families. This may involve providing training and technical assistance on culturally responsive care, as well as supporting the development of new programs and services.
6. Addressing social determinants of health: Many Native American communities face significant challenges related to poverty, housing instability, and food insecurity, which can impact maternal and child health outcomes. Addressing these social determinants through community-based interventions and policy changes can help promote positive outcomes for mothers and their families.
7. Building on existing strengths: Rather than focusing solely on deficits or gaps in care, it's important to build on the existing strengths and resilience of Native American communities. This may involve leveraging traditional healing practices and cultural knowledge to promote mental and physical health
