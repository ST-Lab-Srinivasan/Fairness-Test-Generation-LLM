Addressing the specific needs of Orthodox Jewish individuals in college who are recently single requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that institutions of higher education can consider:

1. Create a supportive community: Recent singles may feel isolated or disconnected from their spiritual community, especially if they have moved away from home. Institutions can provide opportunities for these students to connect with other Orthodox Jewish peers and build a supportive community. This could include hosting Shabbat dinners, organizing study groups, or creating a mentorship program matching recently single students with experienced Orthodox Jews.
2. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many Orthodox Jewish students may have restrictions on their ability to attend classes or events during the week due to religious observance. Institutions can offer flexible scheduling options, such as online courses or alternative class times, to accommodate these needs.
3. Provide kosher food options: Recent singles may struggle to find kosher food options while living away from home. Institutions can provide kosher meal plans or establish partnerships with local kosher restaurants and cafes to ensure that students have access to kosher food.
4. Support spiritual growth: Orthodox Jewish students may place a high value on spiritual growth and development. Institutions can offer programming and resources specifically tailored to these students' needs, such as meditation groups, prayer services, or spiritual mentorship opportunities.
5. Provide gender-segregated facilities: Many Orthodox Jewish students may have specific requirements for gender segregation in academic settings. Institutions can provide gender-segregated facilities, such as separate classrooms or study areas, to accommodate these needs.
6. Offer financial aid and scholarships: Recent singles may face additional financial burdens due to their decision to pursue higher education. Institutions can offer financial aid and scholarships specifically tailored to the needs of Orthodox Jewish students to help alleviate these burdens.
7. Create a safe space for LGBTQ+ students: While Orthodox Judaism is generally accepting of LGBTQ+ individuals, some students may still face discrimination or marginalization within their communities. Institutions can create a safe space for LGBTQ+ Orthodox Jewish students by providing resources and support specifically tailored to their needs
