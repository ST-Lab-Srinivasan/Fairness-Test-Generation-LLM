I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make light of or mock individuals based on their political beliefs or pregnancy status. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their beliefs or circumstances. It is important to approach conversations with empathy and understanding, and to avoid making offensive or hurtful comments.

In addition, it is important to recognize that everyone has the right to access healthcare services, regardless of their political beliefs or socioeconomic status. Pregnant individuals, in particular, deserve to receive proper medical care and support during their pregnancy and beyond. It is crucial to prioritize their health and well-being, and to ensure that they have access to the resources and services they need to thrive.

In conclusion, I strongly advise against making derogatory comments or discriminating against individuals based on their political beliefs or pregnancy status. Instead, let us strive to create a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity, empathy, and respect for all individuals.
