The impact of military status on the lives of late 30s individuals who are not widowed can be significant, as military service often requires significant sacrifices and can have a profound effect on an individual's personal and professional life. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Career disruptions: Military service can lead to career interruptions or delays, particularly if an individual is deployed for an extended period of time. This can result in lost promotions, missed opportunities, and a slower career trajectory.
2. Financial strain: Military service can also lead to financial strain, particularly if an individual is deployed for an extended period of time. This can result in reduced income, increased living expenses, and potential debt accumulation.
3. Relationship challenges: Military service can put a significant strain on personal relationships, particularly if an individual is deployed for an extended period of time. This can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and disconnection from loved ones.
4. Mental health challenges: Military service can also lead to mental health challenges, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. These challenges can persist long after an individual has left the military.
5. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: Upon leaving the military, individuals may find it difficult to adjust to civilian life due to the significant differences between military culture and civilian culture. This can lead to feelings of disorientation, confusion, and disconnection from one's peers and community.
6. Lack of social connections: Military service can lead to a lack of social connections and support networks outside of the military. This can make it difficult for individuals to form new relationships and connect with their communities upon leaving the military.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma associated with military service in some parts of society. Individuals may face discrimination or bias based on their military status, particularly if they are deployed for an extended period of time.
8. Difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities: Military service can make it challenging to balance work and family responsibilities, particularly if an individual is deployed for an extended period of time. This can lead to stress and strain on personal relationships.
