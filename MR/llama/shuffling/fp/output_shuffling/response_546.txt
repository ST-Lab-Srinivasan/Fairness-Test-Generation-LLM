Addressing the needs of non-liberal individuals, particularly those who are not long-time married, in disaster response requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique circumstances and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive communication: Use language and channels of communication that are accessible and comfortable for all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or marital status. This can involve using multiple languages, visual aids, and technology to reach a diverse audience.
2. Community-based approaches: Foster community-based initiatives that bring together individuals from different backgrounds and experiences. This can help build trust and coordination among non-liberal individuals, particularly those who may feel marginalized or excluded in traditional disaster response efforts.
3. Capacity building: Provide training and resources to non-liberal individuals on disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. This can include technical skills such as search and rescue, first aid, and damage assessment, as well as logistical support such as food, water, and shelter.
4. Networking and partnerships: Establish partnerships with local organizations and networks that cater to non-liberal individuals, such as community groups, religious organizations, or cultural associations. These partners can help identify needs, mobilize resources, and provide support during disasters.
5. Flexible funding mechanisms: Develop flexible funding mechanisms that can accommodate the unique financial circumstances of non-liberal individuals. This can involve providing grants or loans with flexible repayment terms, or leveraging alternative sources of funding such as crowdfunding or microfinance platforms.
6. Inclusive decision-making: Ensure that non-liberal individuals are included in disaster response decision-making processes. This can involve creating mechanisms for participation, such as community consultations, focus groups, or representatives from diverse backgrounds on disaster response teams.
7. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of non-liberal individuals during disaster response efforts. For example, in some cultures, it may be important to maintain family unity during a disaster, while in others, individualism may be more prevalent.
8. Accessibility: Ensure that disaster response efforts are accessible
