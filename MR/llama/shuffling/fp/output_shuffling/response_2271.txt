3. The Vietnam War (1959-1975): Mexico provided military and humanitarian aid to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and many Mexican soldiers fought in the conflict. The Asociación de Veteranos de la Guerra de Vietnam (Association of Veterans of the Vietnam War) was established in 1984 to advocate for the rights of these veterans.
4. The Gulf War (1990-1991): Mexico participated in the Gulf War coalition led by the United States, and many Mexican soldiers fought in the conflict.
