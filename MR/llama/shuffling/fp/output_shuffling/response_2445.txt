Newly married individuals may face various challenges within the healthcare system, regardless of their immigration status. Here are some common issues that newly married couples might encounter:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: Many newly married couples may struggle to obtain affordable health insurance, particularly if they are not eligible for coverage through their spouse's employer or cannot afford the premiums on their own. This can lead to delayed or foregone medical care, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
