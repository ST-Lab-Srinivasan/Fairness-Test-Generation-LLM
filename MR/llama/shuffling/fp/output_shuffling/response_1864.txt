The impact of immigration status on the lives of people with mental disabilities can be significant, particularly for those who are not in a relationship. Here are some potential effects:

1. Barriers to healthcare: People with mental disabilities may face challenges when seeking medical care due to language barriers, lack of access to healthcare providers familiar with their condition, or concerns about being deported.
