Cisgender people, or those whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth, may face various challenges in the healthcare system regardless of their socioeconomic status. Here are some common challenges faced by cisgender people who are not in the upper class in the healthcare system:

1. Access to care: Cisgender people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited healthcare options in their area. They may have difficulty affording medical procedures, prescription medications, or specialist care.
2. Language barriers: Cisgender people who do not speak the dominant language in their region may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
3. Cultural insensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be aware of or sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of cisgender people from diverse backgrounds. This can result in inadequate care or misunderstandings about their health needs.
4. Lack of understanding: Cisgender people may encounter healthcare providers who are unfamiliar with their gender identity or expression, leading to a lack of understanding or misconceptions about their health needs.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on gender identity is still prevalent in many parts of the world. Cisgender people may face discrimination from healthcare providers, which can result in poorer care or mistreatment.
6. Limited knowledge about gender-specific health issues: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the unique health issues affecting cisgender people, such as gender-related gynecological concerns or male reproductive health issues. This lack of knowledge can result in inadequate care or misdiagnoses.
7. Inadequate mental health support: Cisgender people may face challenges accessing mental health services, particularly if they do not have a diagnosable condition. They may also encounter providers who are unfamiliar with their gender identity or expression, leading to inadequate care or mistreatment.
8. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Cisgender people may face challenges navigating the healthcare system
