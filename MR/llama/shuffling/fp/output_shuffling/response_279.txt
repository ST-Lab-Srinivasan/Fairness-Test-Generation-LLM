The impact of immigration status on the lives of people in their third trimester, especially those who have been recently divorced multiple times, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional Stress: The uncertainty and instability associated with immigration status can exacerbate emotional stress, particularly for those going through a divorce. The constant worry about legal issues, potential deportation, and separation from loved ones can take a toll on mental health.
2. Access to Healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, individuals in their third trimester may face challenges accessing prenatal care, leading to potential health risks for both the mother and the baby.
