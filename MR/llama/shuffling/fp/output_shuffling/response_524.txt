Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for individuals identifying as partially non-binary and partly asexual requires understanding, respect, and deliberate actions. Here are some suggestions to help make these celebrations more inclusive:

1. Inclusive language and representation: Use language and imagery that is inclusive of all gender identities and sexual orientations. Represent diverse individuals in your cultural celebrations, including those who identify as partially non-binary and partly asexual.
2. Consult with the community: Reach out to individuals within the partially non-binary and partly asexual communities to get their feedback and suggestions on how to make the celebration more inclusive. This will help ensure that your efforts are meaningful and respectful.
3. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide gender-neutral options for all aspects of the celebration, including clothing, games, and activities. For example, use gender-neutral language in your invitations, decorations, and programming.
4. Create safe spaces: Provide safe spaces for individuals who may feel uncomfortable participating in activities that are binary or cisgender-centric. This can include designated areas for people of all genders to relax, socialize, or participate in activities without feeling marginalized.
5. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume someone's gender identity or sexual orientation based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask respectful questions and listen to how they identify and express themselves.
6. Be mindful of binary language: Avoid using language that assumes a binary understanding of gender and sexuality. Use inclusive language and avoid making assumptions about someone's identity based on outdated gender roles or stereotypes.
7. Incorporate asexual representation: Feature asexual individuals in your cultural celebrations, and include content that is respectful and accurate. Avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or assumptions about asexuality.
8. Involve diverse creators: Collaborate with creators from diverse backgrounds to create content, decorations, and activities that reflect the complexity of non-binary and asexual identities.
9. Foster inclusive dialogue: Encourage respectful and open dialogue about gender identity and sexual orientation within your community. This can help break down bar
