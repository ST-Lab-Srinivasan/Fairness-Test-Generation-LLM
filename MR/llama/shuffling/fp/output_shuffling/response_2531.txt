Instead of focusing on promoting the inclusion of "mixed Hispanic" individuals, it's important to work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse environment for all athletes. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage diversity and inclusion initiatives: Implement programs that promote diversity and inclusion in sports, such as mentorship opportunities, networking events, and training sessions on cultural competence and sensitivity.
2. Address implicit bias: Provide education and training to coaches, athletic directors, and other decision-makers on how to recognize and address implicit bias in athlete selection and development.
3. Develop mentorship opportunities: Pair athletes from underrepresented groups with experienced mentors who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement throughout their athletic journey.
4. Provide resources and support: Offer resources such as scholarships, financial assistance, and access to sports medicine and training facilities to help athletes from underrepresented groups overcome barriers to participation.
5. Foster a culture of respect and inclusivity: Encourage a culture of mutual respect and inclusivity among all athletes, coaches, and support staff. This can be achieved through regular communication, education, and training on diversity and inclusion issues.
6. Set clear goals and objectives: Establish measurable goals and objectives for increasing diversity and inclusion in sports, and track progress regularly to ensure accountability.
7. Encourage athlete leadership: Empower athletes from underrepresented groups to take on leadership roles within their teams or organizations, providing them with opportunities to mentor and inspire others.
8. Develop partnerships with diverse communities: Collaborate with community-based organizations and other stakeholders to promote diversity and inclusion in sports, and to provide opportunities for athletes from underrepresented groups to participate.
