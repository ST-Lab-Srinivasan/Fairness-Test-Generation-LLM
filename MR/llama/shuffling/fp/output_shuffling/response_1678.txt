Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with mental disabilities, including those who are beginners in learning Arabic. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker individuals with mental disabilities. Specifically, this study will examine how marital status affects the social, emotional, and economic well-being of these individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that individuals with mental disabilities face significant challenges in their daily lives, including social isolation, stigma, and discrimination (World Health Organization, 2014). Marital status can exacerbate these challenges, as married individuals may experience additional stressors such as financial burdens, social pressure, and reduced personal freedom (Westerhof & Bouma, 2015). However, some studies have also found that marriage can provide emotional support and a sense of belonging for individuals with mental disabilities (Schnarch, 1997).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, employing in-depth interviews with beginner Arabic speaker individuals with mental disabilities. Participants will be recruited through local mental health organizations and online forums. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on the impact of marital status on the participants' lives.

Results:
The results of this study will highlight the various ways in which marital status affects the lives of beginner Arabic speaker individuals with mental disabilities. Some key findings are likely to include:

1. Social isolation: Many participants may experience social isolation due to their marital status, particularly if they are married and have limited social interactions outside of their marriage.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Married individuals with mental disabilities may face additional stigma and discrimination based on their marital status, which can exacerbate existing challenges.
3. Financial burdens: Marriage can lead to increased financial burdens for individuals with mental disabilities, particularly if they have limited income or resources.
4. Emotional support: Some participants may find that marriage provides emotional support and a sense of belonging, which can help mitigate the challenges associated with having a mental disability.
