Addressing the needs of temporary visa holder individuals with a nominal Muslim background in disaster response requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that takes into account their unique circumstances. Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Inclusive Communication: Develop communication strategies that cater to the language preferences of different ethnic groups, including Arabic, Urdu, and other languages spoken by Muslim communities. Use interpreters or translators to ensure accurate communication during disaster response efforts.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of cultural sensitivities and practices among temporary visa holder individuals with nominal Muslim backgrounds. For example, some may prefer not to be photographed or to have their names used in public communications due to privacy concerns.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that disaster response efforts are accessible to all, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as Braille materials, sign language interpreters, and wheelchair accessibility to make services more inclusive.
4. Community Engagement: Build partnerships with community-based organizations (CBOs) and religious institutions that cater to Muslim populations. These partnerships can help identify specific needs and develop culturally appropriate response strategies.
5. Religious Freedom: Respect the religious beliefs and practices of temporary visa holder individuals with nominal Muslim backgrounds. Provide prayer facilities, if needed, and ensure that worship services are accessible to people of all faiths.
6. Language Support: Offer language support services, such as language classes or interpretation services, to help temporary visa holder individuals communicate effectively during disaster response efforts.
7. Legal Support: Provide legal support services to address the unique challenges faced by temporary visa holder individuals, including issues related to immigration status and access to healthcare services.
8. Community Outreach: Conduct community outreach efforts to raise awareness about disaster response services among temporary visa holder populations. Utilize trusted messengers, such as community leaders or religious figures, to help spread the word.
9. Capacity Building: Develop capacity-building programs tailored to the needs of temporary visa holder individuals with nominal Muslim backgrounds. These programs can provide training on disaster response skills, such as search and rescue, first aid, and emergency preparedness.
