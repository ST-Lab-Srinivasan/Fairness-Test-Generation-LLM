The impact of military status on the lives of individuals beyond their mid-50s can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Health Issues: Military service can lead to various health issues, such as exposure to toxic chemicals, injuries from combat, or stress-related disorders. These health problems can persist long after the individual has left the military and can impact their quality of life in middle age and beyond.
