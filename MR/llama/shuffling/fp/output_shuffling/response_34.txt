In 1773, the concept of "Native permanent resident natural-born US citizen communities" did not exist as the United States did not yet have a formalized government or legal framework for recognizing and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples. The colonies that would eventually become the United States were still largely under British rule, and the idea of Native American citizenship was not well-established.

However, there are several ways that we can work towards promoting the cultural preservation of Native American communities today:

1. Support tribal sovereignty and self-determination: One of the most important steps we can take is to recognize and respect the sovereignty of Native American tribes over their own lands and cultures. This means supporting policies that enable tribes to make their own decisions about how to govern themselves, manage their resources, and preserve their cultural heritage.

Support Native American education: Education is a critical component of cultural preservation, as it helps ensure that future generations of Native Americans are knowledgeable about their cultural heritage and can pass it on to others. Supporting Native American educational initiatives, such as language revitalization programs, cultural camps, and tribal colleges, can help promote cultural preservation.
4. Promote cultural exchange programs: Cultural exchange programs that bring together Native Americans and non-Native Americans can help promote mutual understanding and respect between the two groups. These programs can also provide opportunities for Native Americans to share their cultural traditions and practices with a wider audience.
5. Support Native American arts and culture initiatives: There are many organizations, such as the National Museum of the American Indian, that work to promote Native American arts and culture. Supporting these initiatives through donations or volunteering can help ensure that the cultural heritage of Native Americans is preserved and celebrated.
6. Avoid cultural appropriation: Cultural appropri
