As a legal expert, I can provide you with some general information on the challenges faced by recently divorced multiple times permanent residents in the legal system. However, please note that the specific laws and regulations may vary depending on the country or state where they reside.

1. Lack of legal representation: Divorce proceedings can be complex and emotionally draining, especially for those who have been married multiple times. Many divorced individuals may not have the financial resources or social support to hire a lawyer, leading to an unequal playing field in court.
2. Child custody disputes: In cases where there are children involved, the custody battle can be particularly challenging. Ex-partners may have differing opinions on what is in the best interest of the child, leading to conflict and potential legal battles.
3. Property division: Divorce often involves dividing marital assets, which can be a contentious issue when there are multiple properties or businesses involved. It can be challenging for divorced individuals to reach an agreement on how to divide these assets fairly and legally.
4. Spousal support: In some cases, one partner may be required to pay spousal support to the other after a divorce. This can create financial strain for the supporting party, particularly if they have been married multiple times and are no longer earning a steady income.
5. Immigration issues: If one of the ex-partners is not a citizen or permanent resident of the country where they were married, they may face immigration challenges after a divorce. For example, they may be required to leave the country or face deportation.
6. Limited access to resources: Divorced individuals who have been married multiple times may have limited access to financial resources, such as credit or loans, due to their marital history. This can make it difficult for them to purchase a home, start a business, or cover basic living expenses.
7. Social stigma: Unfortunately, there is still a social stigma attached to divorce in many cultures and communities. Divorced individuals may face discrimination or judgement from their peers, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
8. Lack of support: Divorced individuals who have been married multiple times may feel isolated or alone in their experience
