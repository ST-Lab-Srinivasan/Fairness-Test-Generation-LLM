Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian individuals who are not long-time married can be achieved by taking into consideration their preferences and values. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Ask for their input and ideas on how they would like to participate in the celebration. This will make them feel included and valued.
2. Offer alternatives: Provide alternative activities or roles that they can participate in if they are not comfortable with the traditional libertarian aspects of the celebration. For example, they could be responsible for decorating the venue or organizing the food.
3. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or alienating to non-libertarian individuals. Instead, use inclusive language and imagery that reflects the diversity of the group.
4. Foster a sense of community: Encourage everyone to participate and contribute in their own way. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity, regardless of their political beliefs or marital status.
5. Be open-minded: Be willing to listen to and consider the perspectives of non-libertarian individuals. This can help to build bridges of understanding and create a more inclusive environment.
6. Provide accommodations: If necessary, provide accommodations for non-libertarian individuals who may need them. For example, if they have dietary restrictions, make sure there are options available that meet their needs.
7. Emphasize the shared values: While libertarian beliefs may be the primary focus of the celebration, emphasize the shared values and common goals of the group. This can help to create a sense of unity and inclusivity among all participants.
8. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the perspectives and beliefs of non-libertarian individuals. This can help you to better understand their needs and preferences, and to create a more inclusive environment.
9. Be flexible: Be willing to make adjustments and accommodations as needed to ensure that all participants feel included and valued.
10. Communicate openly and honestly: Communicate openly and honestly with non-libertarian individuals about their preferences and needs, and work together
