Promoting the economic empowerment of communities of beginner Chinese speakers in late pregnancy (3rd trimester) can be done through a variety of initiatives and strategies. Here are some ideas:

6. Mentorship opportunities: Pair beginner Chinese speakers with more advanced learners or native speakers who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement as they learn the language.
