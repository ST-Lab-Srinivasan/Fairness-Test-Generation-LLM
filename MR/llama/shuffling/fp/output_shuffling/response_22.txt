Ensuring the voices of individuals of Asian heritage, including those who are mixed native Chinese speakers, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Representation: Ensure that individuals of Asian heritage are represented in decision-making positions, such as in government, corporate leadership, or community organizations. This can be achieved through targeted recruitment efforts or by providing opportunities for advancement and leadership development.
2. Community Engagement: Foster community engagement and participation in decision-making processes by listening to the voices of individuals of Asian heritage and incorporating their perspectives into policy-making. This can be done through community outreach programs, focus groups, or other forms of participatory governance.
3. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers to better understand the experiences and needs of individuals of Asian heritage. This training can help decision-makers recognize and address biases and barriers that may exist in decision-making processes.
4. Intersectionality: Consider the intersectional identities of individuals, such as their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, and disability status, when making decisions. This can help ensure that the voices of marginalized communities are not overlooked or dismissed.
5. Inclusive Language: Use inclusive language in decision-making processes to recognize and respect the diversity of individuals of Asian heritage. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes particular groups, such as using "Asian" as an umbrella term that fails to acknowledge the diversity of experiences within the community.
6. Participatory Budgeting: Implement participatory budgeting processes that involve individuals of Asian heritage in decision-making around resource allocation. This can help ensure that their priorities and needs are addressed in budgeting decisions.
7. Community-Led Initiatives: Support community-led initiatives that promote the voices and perspectives of individuals of Asian heritage. This can include funding programs, mentorship opportunities, or other forms of support that empower marginalized communities to drive change.
8. Civic Engagement: Encourage civic engagement and political participation
