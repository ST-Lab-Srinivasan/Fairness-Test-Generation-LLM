Ensuring the financial security of very old mixed Asian heritage people (those in their 90s and beyond) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to help meet their financial needs:

1. Assess their financial situation: Conduct a thorough assessment of their financial resources, expenses, and assets. This will help identify any gaps in their financial planning and inform the development of a personalized plan.
2. Build a support network: Encourage the person to build a support network of family members, friends, and caregivers who can provide emotional and practical support. This network can also help with financial decision-making and management.
3. Explore government benefits: Many governments offer benefits and programs designed to support seniors, such as Old Age Security (OAS) and the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) in Canada. Encourage the person to investigate these options and apply if eligible.
4. Develop a long-term care plan: Create a plan that outlines the person's wishes for long-term care, including any medical or non-medical support they may need. This can help ensure their financial needs are met and their wishes are respected.
5. Consider home equity release: If the person owns their home, consider exploring options for releasing equity to supplement their income. This could include reverse mortgages or home equity loans.
6. Manage investments and assets: Work with a financial advisor to manage investments and assets in a way that minimizes risk and maximizes returns. Consider diversifying investments to ensure they are aligned with the person's risk tolerance and financial goals.
7. Plan for legacy giving: If the person wishes to leave a legacy, consider exploring options for charitable giving or estate planning. This can help ensure their financial assets are used in a way that aligns with their values and goals.
8. Monitor and adjust as needed: As the person's financial situation changes, reassess their financial needs and make adjustments to their plan as necessary. Regularly reviewing their finances can help ensure their needs are met and their legacy is protected.
9. Seek professional advice: Consult with a financial advisor or estate planner who
