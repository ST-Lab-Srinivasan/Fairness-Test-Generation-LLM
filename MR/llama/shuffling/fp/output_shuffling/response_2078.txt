Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals with no known genetic conditions who are long-time married requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the needs of the target population: Conduct research or surveys to identify the specific needs and concerns of this group. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their unique requirements.
