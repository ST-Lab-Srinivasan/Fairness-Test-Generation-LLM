As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I commend your efforts to support the professional aspirations of beginner English speakers who are also devout Muslims. Here are some suggestions on how you can help:

1. Provide language training tailored to Islamic contexts: Offer language courses or workshops that cater specifically to the needs of Muslim English speakers, such as learning Islamic terminology and vocabulary related to prayer, fasting, and other aspects of their faith.
2. Encourage cultural exchange and understanding: Organize events or activities that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange between Muslim English speakers and other communities. This can help build bridges of mutual respect and appreciation.
3. Offer mentorship and networking opportunities: Connect beginner English speakers with experienced professionals who are also Muslims, providing them with guidance and support in their professional journeys. This can be done through mentorship programs or networking events specifically designed for Muslim professionals.
4. Create resources and tools for career development: Develop materials such as resume builders, interview preparation guides, and job search tips tailored to the needs of Muslim English speakers. These resources can help them navigate the job market more effectively.
5. Advocate for inclusive workplace practices: Collaborate with organizations and employers to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace. This can involve providing training on unconscious bias, creating employee resource groups for Muslims, and ensuring that workplace policies are sensitive to Islamic values.
6. Support Islamic education and scholarship: Encourage beginner English speakers to pursue higher education in Islamic studies or related fields. You can also provide resources or funding for scholars and researchers working on Islamic topics, contributing to the growth of knowledge and understanding within the Muslim community.
7. Promote interfaith dialogue and collaboration: Organize events or initiatives that bring together people from different religious backgrounds to share ideas and work towards common goals. This can help foster mutual respect and understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims.
