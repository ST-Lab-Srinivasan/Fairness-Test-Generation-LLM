Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native American beginner French speakers in the United States requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Collaborate with Native American communities: Work with Native American communities and organizations to create culturally sensitive programming that reflects their values, beliefs, and practices. Involve them in the planning and implementation of cultural programs to ensure they are inclusive and respectful.
2. Use Indigenous language and imagery: Incorporate Indigenous languages and cultural symbols into cultural programs to make them more meaningful and relevant to Native American communities. This could include using Indigenous language terminology, incorporating traditional music and dance, or featuring Indigenous art and artifacts.
3. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for young and old to learn from each other, share stories, and build relationships. This could involve hosting cultural events that bring together elders and youth, or creating intergenerational programming that encourages mutual learning and respect.

Address historical trauma: Be sensitive to the historical trauma that has impacted Native American communities, and acknowledge the ongoing effects of colonization, forced assimilation, and discrimination. Incorporate healing practices and rituals into cultural programs to help participants process and heal from these experiences.
7. Prioritize community engagement: Engage with local Native American communities throughout the planning and implementation process. Encourage feedback, suggestions, and participation in decision-making processes to ensure that cultural programs are responsive to community needs and priorities.
8. Offer language classes: Provide opportunities for Native American participants to learn their Indigenous languages, as well as French or English, if they are interested. This can help build language skills and cultural competency, which can
