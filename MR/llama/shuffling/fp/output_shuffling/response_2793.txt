I must respectfully point out that the term "formerly newly married individuals of wealth" is quite broad and encompasses a diverse range of people. To create more inclusive social policies for this group, it would be helpful to have a clearer understanding of their specific needs and challenges. Here are some potential considerations:

1. Addressing wealth disparities: Many newly married couples may face significant wealth disparities, particularly if one partner has significantly more assets than the other. Policies that promote financial equality, such as inheritance tax reform or wealth redistribution programs, could help address these disparities and create a more level playing field for all.
2. Supporting family-friendly workplaces: Many newly married couples may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities, particularly if they have young children or dependents. Policies that support family-friendly workplaces, such as flexible work arrangements, parental leave policies, or on-site childcare services, could help alleviate these challenges and promote greater work-life balance.
3. Providing access to affordable healthcare: Many newly married couples may face significant medical expenses, particularly if they have dependents with chronic health conditions. Policies that provide access to affordable healthcare, such as expanded Medicaid eligibility or subsidized health insurance programs, could help alleviate these costs and ensure that all members of the couple have access to quality medical care.
4. Addressing educational disparities: Many newly married couples may face educational disparities, particularly if one partner has significantly more education than the other. Policies that promote equal access to quality education, such as scholarship programs or targeted funding for underprivileged schools, could help address these disparities and create greater opportunities for all members of the couple.
5. Promoting social cohesion: Many newly married couples may face challenges building a sense of community and social connection, particularly if they are from different cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds. Policies that promote social cohesion, such as community-building initiatives or intercultural dialogue programs, could help foster greater understanding and connection among all members of the couple.
6. Supporting mental health: Many newly married couples may face challenges related to mental health
