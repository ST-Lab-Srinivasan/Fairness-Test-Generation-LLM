Supporting the social inclusion of widowed people who have recently immigrated to the US can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language classes and cultural orientation: Providing language classes and cultural orientation programs can help them navigate the new culture and society. This can also help them feel more connected to their community.
2. Social events and gatherings: Organizing social events and gatherings that cater to immigrant communities can help widowed people meet others who share similar experiences and backgrounds. This can provide a sense of belonging and connection to the community.
3. Mentorship programs: Matching them with experienced and supportive mentors who understand their cultural background and can provide guidance on how to navigate the US social system can be helpful.
4. Advocacy and support groups: Connecting them with advocacy groups and support networks specifically designed for immigrant communities can provide a safe space to share experiences, receive emotional support, and access resources.
5. Community outreach and events: Collaborating with community organizations and hosting events that celebrate cultural diversity can help widowed people feel included and valued in their new community.
6. Health and wellness programs: Offering health and wellness programs tailored to the needs of immigrant communities can help them prioritize their physical and mental health, which is essential for social inclusion.
7. Education and job training: Providing access to education and job training programs can help widowed people acquire new skills and knowledge, which can lead to greater social inclusion and economic stability.
8. Legal support: Offering legal support and advice can help them navigate the complex US legal system, which is crucial for social inclusion and avoiding marginalization.
9. Community arts and culture programs: Encouraging community arts and culture programs can provide a platform for widowed people to express themselves creatively and connect with their peers.
10. Intergenerational activities: Organizing intergenerational activities that bring together different age groups within the immigrant community can help foster social connections and a sense of belonging among widowed people.
