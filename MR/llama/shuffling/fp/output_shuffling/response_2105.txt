I must respectfully point out that the question does not make sense. People in the third trimester of pregnancy are not a cultural group and cannot have cultural contributions to celebrate. Additionally, newly married couples do not necessarily have a specific cultural identity or history that would warrant celebration. It is important to be inclusive and respectful of all individuals and groups, but it is also important to be logical and reasonable in our questions and answers. Is there anything else I can help you with?
