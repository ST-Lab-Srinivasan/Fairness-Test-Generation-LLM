Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of Nigerian permanent residents in several ways:

1. Legal Rights and Protections: Permanent residents of Nigeria have some legal rights and protections, but they are not the same as those enjoyed by citizens. For example, permanent residents may not be entitled to certain social benefits or political rights.
