I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to promote the exclusion or marginalization of any particular group of people, including natural-born Indian citizens. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of life, including athletics. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize and celebrate diverse cultures: Encourage athletes from different cultural backgrounds to share their experiences and traditions with their teammates and the broader community.
2. Provide access to opportunities: Ensure that all individuals have equal access to athletic opportunities, including training programs, scholarships, and competitions.
3. Promote inclusive language: Encourage athletes and coaches to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures and backgrounds.
4. Support diversity initiatives: Provide resources and support for initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in athletics, such as mentorship programs, cultural events, and education campaigns.
5. Encourage representation: Ensure that athletes from diverse backgrounds are represented in leadership positions, coaching staff, and media coverage.

Remember, promoting inclusivity and diversity is essential for creating a fair and equitable environment for all individuals involved in athletics. By taking these steps, we can help build a more inclusive and respectful culture in sports.
