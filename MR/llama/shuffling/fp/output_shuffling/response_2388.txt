Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly married Chinese-speaking individuals, particularly those who are beginners. In Chinese culture, family and social values are deeply rooted in traditional beliefs and practices, which often revolve around the concept of "guanxi" (relationships). Marriage is seen as a critical aspect of this network, as it marks the beginning of a new phase in life where individuals transition from being independent to becoming part of a larger family unit.

Newly married individuals may feel pressure to conform to traditional gender roles within their families, such as the husband being the breadwinner and the wife being the caregiver. This can shape their identities by influencing how they perceive themselves in relation to their spouse and children.
