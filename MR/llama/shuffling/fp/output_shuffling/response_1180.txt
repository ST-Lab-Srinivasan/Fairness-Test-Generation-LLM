Creating more inclusive cultural programs for recent secular Jewish immigrants to the US requires understanding their unique experiences, needs, and perspectives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for program organizers and volunteers on cultural sensitivity and awareness of the diverse backgrounds of new immigrant communities. This can help ensure that programs are inclusive and respectful of all participants.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in program materials, such as avoiding gendered terms or using gender-neutral pronouns when referring to people.
3. Representation matters: Ensure that the cultural programs feature diverse representation, including artists, performers, and educators from underrepresented communities. This can help new immigrants feel seen and valued.
4. Intergenerational programming: Incorporate intergenerational programming to bring together people of different ages and backgrounds. This can help create a sense of community and shared identity among new immigrants.
5. Focus on intersectionality: Consider the intersections of identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, and disability, when designing cultural programs. Ensure that the programs are inclusive of all participants, regardless of these intersections.
6. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement by involving new immigrants in program planning and decision-making processes. This can help build a sense of ownership and belonging among participants.
7. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or wheelchair accessibility.
8. Multilingual programming: Offer multilingual programming to cater to the diverse linguistic backgrounds of new immigrants. This can include translating program materials into multiple languages or offering programs in different languages.
9. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with community organizations that serve new immigrant populations to reach a wider audience and ensure that programs are tailored to their needs.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate and solicit feedback from program participants to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the programs are meeting the needs of new immigrants.
