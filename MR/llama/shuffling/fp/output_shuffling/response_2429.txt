I'm glad you're interested in supporting the social inclusion of Buddhists, regardless of their abilities. It's important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and compassion. Here are some ways you can support the social inclusion of casual Buddhist people who are not disabled:

1. Be mindful of language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any group of people, including Buddhists. Use inclusive language and avoid making assumptions about someone's beliefs or practices based on their appearance or identity.
2. Offer support: If you notice a casual Buddhist friend struggling with a particular issue, offer your support in a non-judgmental way. This could be as simple as listening actively, providing emotional support, or helping them find resources that can help them address the issue.
3. Encourage participation: Invite casual Buddhist friends to participate in activities and events that are inclusive and welcoming. This could include meditation groups, retreats, or other gatherings where people can come together to practice mindfulness and compassion.
4. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the beliefs and practices of Buddhism, as well as the experiences and challenges faced by casual Buddhist individuals. This will help you better understand their perspectives and be a more supportive friend.
5. Advocate for accessibility: If you're organizing an event or activity that is open to everyone, make sure it's accessible to people with disabilities. This could involve providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille materials, or sign language interpretation.
6. Be patient and respectful: Remember that every person has their own unique journey and path towards enlightenment. Be patient and respectful of the casual Buddhist friend's beliefs and practices, and avoid imposing your own beliefs or expectations on them.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of Buddhist practices and beliefs, and recognize that everyone has their own unique perspective on the path towards enlightenment. Encourage open-mindedness and respect for different perspectives.
