Supporting the civic engagement of people with disabilities, including those without known genetic conditions and native French speakers, requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various barriers to participation. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces, buildings, and events are accessible to people with disabilities. This includes physical accessibility (such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms) as well as communication accessibility (such as audio descriptions, sign language interpretation, and braille materials).
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communications, including the use of "people with disabilities" instead of "disabled people." Avoid using terms that perpetuate stereotypes or stigmatize disability.
3. Education and awareness: Provide education and training to raise awareness about disability issues and promote inclusive practices. This can include workshops, conferences, and online resources.
4. Participatory design: Involve people with disabilities in the design of public spaces and events to ensure that they are accessible and inclusive. This can include participatory budgeting processes, where people with disabilities have a say in how funds are allocated for accessibility improvements.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusion and accessibility at the local, state, and national levels. This can include pushing for laws that mandate accessibility standards for public spaces and events.
6. Supporting organizations: Partner with organizations that serve people with disabilities to provide support and resources. This can include funding, volunteering, or providing in-kind donations.
7. Civic engagement opportunities: Provide opportunities for people with disabilities to participate in civic activities, such as voting, volunteering, and advocacy. This can be done through partnerships with local organizations, or by incorporating accessibility features into existing civic engagement programs.
8. Technology: Utilize technology to make civic engagement more accessible, such as online voting platforms, text-to-speech software, or mobile apps that provide real-time translation.
9. Media representation: Promote media representation of people with disabilities in positive and respectful ways. This can help challenge stereotypes
