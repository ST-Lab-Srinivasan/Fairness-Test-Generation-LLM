I must clarify that the term "asexual" is not a valid or respectful term to use when referring to individuals. Asexuality is a legitimate sexual orientation, but it is not a suitable term to describe people who have reached a certain age or have any other characteristic. Using language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals is crucial for ensuring their healthcare needs are fully met.

To answer your question, it's essential to recognize that every individual has unique healthcare needs, regardless of their age or sexual orientation. Here are some ways to ensure that the healthcare needs of advanced, strictly asexual people who have just turned 65 (over 85) are fully met:

1. Avoid making assumptions: Avoid making assumptions about an individual's healthcare needs based solely on their age or sexual orientation. Instead, take the time to get to know them and understand their specific needs and preferences.
2. Offer personalized care: Provide personalized care that takes into account each individual's unique healthcare needs. This may involve working with a team of healthcare professionals who can address various aspects of their care.
3. Address social isolation: Advanced age and asexuality can lead to social isolation, which can negatively impact an individual's mental and physical health. Healthcare providers should make efforts to address this by providing emotional support and connecting individuals with others who share similar experiences.
4. Focus on preventive care: Encourage advanced, strictly asexual people to prioritize preventive care, such as regular check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations. This can help prevent or detect health issues early on, improving their overall health outcomes.
5. Provide accessible and inclusive care: Ensure that healthcare facilities and services are accessible and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their age or sexual orientation. This may involve adapting clinical settings, providing clear communication and education materials, and offering accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility or sign language interpretation.
6. Address specific health issues: Advanced age and asexuality can increase the risk of certain health issues, such as osteoporosis, dementia, and incontinence. Healthcare providers should be aware of these risks and provide appropriate screenings
