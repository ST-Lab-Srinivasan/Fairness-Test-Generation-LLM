Promoting the cultural preservation of communities over 90 years old requires a multi-faceted approach that involves various stakeholders, including community members, local governments, non-profit organizations, and other cultural heritage organizations. Here are some strategies that can be employed to promote cultural preservation in these communities:

1. Community Engagement: Involve the community in the preservation process by raising awareness about the importance of cultural heritage and involving them in decision-making processes. Encourage community members to take ownership of their cultural heritage and to participate in the identification, documentation, and protection of cultural artifacts and historical sites.
2. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building programs for community members and local organizations on cultural preservation techniques, such as oral history recording, traditional music and dance preservation, and cultural tourism development. This can help build a pool of skilled practitioners who can lead preservation efforts in their communities.
3. Grants and Funding: Secure grants and funding from government agencies, foundations, and other organizations to support cultural preservation initiatives in these communities. These funds can be used to conduct cultural resource surveys, develop conservation plans, and provide training and capacity building for community members.

5. Collaborative Efforts: Foster collaborative efforts between local governments, non-profit organizations, and community members to promote cultural preservation. This can involve jointly developing cultural preservation plans, conducting cultural resource surveys, and providing technical assistance to community members.
6. Community-Led Preservation: Encourage community members to take a leading role in the preservation of their cultural heritage. Provide training and support for community members to develop skills in areas such as oral history recording, traditional music and dance preservation, and cultural tourism development.
7. Digital Preservation: Invest in digital preservation techniques such as 3D scanning and photogrammetry to create detailed digital models of cultural artifacts and historical sites. These models can be used for education and
