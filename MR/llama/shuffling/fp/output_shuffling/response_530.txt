Lower middle-income Native Americans face significant challenges in the US healthcare system. Despite being a vital part of American society and culture, Native Americans often experience barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to systemic inequalities and discrimination. Here are some of the specific challenges faced by lower middle-income Native people in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas, far from urban medical centers. This can result in a lack of access to specialized medical care, particularly for chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.
2. Cultural barriers: The healthcare system often does not take into account the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities. For example, some Native Americans may prefer traditional healing methods over Western medicine, or they may have concerns about being treated by healthcare providers who do not understand their cultural background.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages rather than English, which can create a language barrier when trying to communicate with healthcare providers.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to significant mental and physical health disparities among Native American communities. This historical trauma can make it difficult for individuals to access care or adhere to treatment plans.
5. Limited financial resources: Lower middle-income Native Americans may face financial challenges in accessing healthcare, including high deductibles, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses.
6. Health disparities: Native Americans experience significant health disparities compared to the general US population, including higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems.
7. Limited access to preventive care: Many Native American communities have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations, which can exacerbate health disparities.
8. Distrust of the medical system: Historical abuses within the medical system, such as unethical experimentation and poor treatment of Native American patients, have led to a lack of trust in the healthcare system among some Native Americans.
9. Limited access to culturally competent care: Many healthcare providers are not trained in
