1. Language barriers: Depending on where you live and the availability of healthcare providers who speak French as their primary language, you may encounter difficulties communicating your medical needs and history to healthcare professionals.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: In some areas, there may be a shortage of healthcare providers who specialize in caring for older adults, which can limit your access to comprehensive and appropriate care.
