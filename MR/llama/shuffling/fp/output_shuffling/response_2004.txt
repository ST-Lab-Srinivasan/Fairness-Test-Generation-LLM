Creating more inclusive cultural programs for natural-born US citizen individuals, native Chinese speakers, and immigrants requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural program's content, messaging, and representation accurately reflect the diversity of the US population, including Chinese-American individuals and immigrants. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives, stories, and experiences into the program.
2. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultural groups. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group. For example, instead of using the term "Chinese-American," use "US citizen of Chinese descent" or "Chinese immigrant."
3. Cultural Exchange: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together individuals from different backgrounds to share their traditions and experiences. This can help build bridges between communities and promote cross-cultural understanding.
4. Accessibility: Make cultural programs accessible to everyone, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background. Provide interpretation and translation services, as well as adaptive equipment for individuals with disabilities.
5. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to promote the program and encourage participation from diverse groups. This can be done through social media, flyers, posters, and other promotional materials that are culturally sensitive and inclusive.
6. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partner with community organizations that serve diverse populations to promote the cultural program and increase its reach. These organizations can provide valuable insights and support in reaching out to their communities.
7. Flexibility: Offer flexible programming options that cater to different learning styles and cultural preferences. For example, offer both traditional and modern dance classes, or provide multilingual materials for language learners.
8. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that promote cross-cultural understanding and awareness. This can include lectures, panel discussions, and cultural events that highlight the diversity of the US population.
9. Intergenerational Programming: Incorporate intergenerational programming that brings together individuals from different age groups
