As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that ensuring the educational needs of any student, including those who identify as nominal Muslims, should be done in a fair and inclusive manner that respects their individual beliefs and practices. Here are some suggestions on how to meet the educational needs of nominal Muslim students while also upholding the principles of small government:

1. Provide access to diverse educational resources: Offer a range of educational materials and resources that cater to different learning styles and preferences. This could include traditional classroom instruction, online courses, and self-paced learning modules. Ensure that these resources are inclusive and respectful of different cultural and religious backgrounds.
2. Encourage student autonomy: Allow students to take an active role in their education by providing choices and opportunities for self-directed learning. This could include allowing students to choose topics or themes for projects, assignments, or presentations that align with their personal interests and beliefs.
3. Foster a supportive learning environment: Create a classroom atmosphere that is welcoming, inclusive, and respectful of all students' beliefs and practices. Encourage open communication, active listening, and constructive dialogue among students.
4. Provide opportunities for spiritual growth: Nominal Muslim students may have different spiritual needs than their peers. Offer opportunities for prayer, reflection, or other spiritual practices that are respectful of their beliefs. This could include designated prayer spaces, quiet areas for contemplation, or guest speakers who can provide spiritual guidance.
5. Encourage critical thinking and inquiry: Nominal Muslim students may have questions or doubts about certain aspects of Islam. Encourage critical thinking and inquiry by providing access to diverse perspectives, scholarly resources, and opportunities for discussions and debates. This can help foster a deeper understanding of the faith and its practices.
6. Support interfaith dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and collaboration among students from different religious backgrounds. This can help promote mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation, while also addressing any concerns or misconceptions that may arise.
7. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with school administrators and policymakers to develop and implement inclusive policies
