1. Language Access: Provide interpretive services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to ensure that patients can communicate effectively with healthcare providers. This is particularly important for those who may not speak the dominant language in their region.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training for healthcare providers to increase awareness of the unique needs and practices of lower-class native Arabic speaker populations. This can help providers better understand the cultural nuances of these communities and provide more appropriate care.
3. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to raise awareness about available healthcare services and promote access to care. This can involve partnering with local organizations, conducting outreach events, and using social media and other communication channels to reach a wider audience.

Health Literacy: Improve health literacy among lower-class native Arabic speaker populations by providing educational materials in their native language or through bilingual health education programs. This can help patients better understand their health conditions, treatment options, and how to manage their care.
