Supporting the civic engagement of non-citizen immigrant natural-born US citizens is crucial for the health and well-being of our democracy. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Provide access to voting information: Non-citizen immigrants may not be aware of their voting rights or how to register to vote. Providing them with accurate and unbiased information about voting laws and procedures can help increase their participation in the electoral process.
2. Offer language assistance: Many non-citizen immigrants may face barriers to civic engagement due to language difficulties. Offering language support services, such as interpreters or translated materials, can help them participate more fully in the democratic process.
3. Promote cultural competency training: It's essential to recognize that non-citizen immigrants come from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Providing cultural competency training for election officials and poll workers can help ensure that they are better equipped to serve this population.
4. Encourage political participation: Encouraging non-citizen immigrants to participate in the political process through volunteering, attending community events, or simply having conversations about politics can help build their sense of belonging and engagement in the democratic system.
5. Advocate for voting rights: Non-citizen immigrants are often denied the right to vote despite their contributions to society. Advocating for their voting rights can help ensure that their voices are heard and their perspectives are represented in the political process.
6. Provide financial support: Many non-citizen immigrants face barriers to civic engagement due to economic constraints. Providing financial support, such as funding for voter registration drives or community events, can help them participate more fully in the democratic process.
7. Create safe spaces: Non-citizen immigrants may feel marginalized or excluded from the political process. Creating safe spaces where they can express their opinions and participate in civic activities can help build trust and foster a sense of belonging.
8. Educate about the electoral process: Many non-citizen immigrants may be unfamiliar with the electoral process or may have misconceptions about how it works.
