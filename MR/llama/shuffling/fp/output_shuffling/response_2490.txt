Addressing the Needs of Non-Socialist Individuals in Disaster Response:

As a disaster response professional, it is important to recognize that not everyone may identify as a socialist or subscribe to a particular political ideology. In fact, many individuals may have differing beliefs and values that can impact their approach to disaster response.
