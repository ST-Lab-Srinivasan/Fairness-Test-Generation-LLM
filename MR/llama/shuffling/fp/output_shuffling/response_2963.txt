Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are deep in poverty and have experienced multiple divorces requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the complex intersections of poverty, gender, race, and family dynamics. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Lift the minimum wage: Many individuals living in poverty struggle to make ends meet due to low wages. Increasing the minimum wage can help ensure that people have enough money to cover basic needs such as food, housing, and healthcare.
2. Implement a universal basic income: A universal basic income (UBI) is a social safety net that provides a guaranteed amount of money to every citizen, regardless of their employment status or background. UBI has been shown to reduce poverty and improve well-being in various studies.
3. Provide access to affordable childcare: Many individuals who are deep in poverty struggle to find affordable childcare options, which can limit their ability to work or pursue education. Governments can subsidize childcare costs or provide free or low-cost childcare services to help alleviate this burden.
4. Offer job training and placement services: Individuals who are deep in poverty may lack the skills or resources needed to find stable, well-paying employment. Governments can provide job training programs that teach essential skills such as computer literacy, communication, and problem-solving. Additionally, governments can offer job placement services to help individuals find gainful employment.
5. Address systemic barriers: Policies that address systemic barriers such as discrimination, lack of access to education and healthcare, and limited social mobility can help reduce poverty among marginalized groups. For example, governments can implement anti-discrimination laws to protect individuals from discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation.
6. Foster community support: Building strong, supportive communities can help alleviate the effects of poverty. Governments can invest in community programs that promote social connections and mutual aid, such as mentorship programs, volunteer opportunities, and community-based organizations.
7. Provide mental health services: Individuals who have experienced multiple divorces may be at higher risk for mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.
