Ensuring that the moderate-income healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizen people are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including accessibility, affordability, and quality of care. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Expanding health insurance coverage: India has a relatively low rate of health insurance penetration compared to other developing countries. Increasing the availability and affordability of health insurance can help bridge the gap for moderate-income individuals who may not be able to afford expensive medical treatments. The government's Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a national health protection scheme, is a step in this direction.
2. Improving accessibility: Many rural and remote areas in India face challenges in accessing quality healthcare due to lack of infrastructure or transportation. Investing in healthcare infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and transportation services, can help improve accessibility and reach marginalized communities.
3. Promoting preventive care: Preventive care can help identify health issues early on, reducing the likelihood of severe illnesses and expensive treatments. Governments and private organizations can promote preventive care by providing education and outreach programs on healthy lifestyles, disease detection, and early intervention.
4. Encouraging telemedicine: Telemedicine can help bridge the gap for remote or underserved communities by providing access to medical consultations and treatments remotely. This can be especially helpful for moderate-income individuals who may not have easy access to healthcare facilities.
5. Developing community health workers: Community health workers (CHWs) are frontline healthcare providers who work in the communities they serve. CHWs can help identify health issues early on, provide basic medical care and referrals, and promote healthy behaviors. Governments and NGOs can invest in training and supporting CHWs to improve healthcare outcomes for moderate-income individuals.
6. Addressing mental health: Mental health issues are prevalent globally, but Indian society often stigmatizes mental illnesses. Providing accessible and affordable mental health services can help moderate-income individuals who may struggle with mental health challenges
