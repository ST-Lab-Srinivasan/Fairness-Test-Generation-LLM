Ensuring the voices of recent immigrants and beginner French speakers are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Support: Provide language support services, such as interpreter services, translation services, or bilingual staff, to ensure that non-English speakers have equal access to information and opportunities for participation.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training to decision-makers and other stakeholders to help them understand the unique needs and experiences of immigrant communities. This can include training on the impact of trauma, discrimination, and systemic barriers on immigrant populations.
3. Outreach and Engagement: Develop outreach and engagement strategies that specifically target recent immigrant and beginner French speaker communities. Use diverse communication channels, such as social media, flyers, and community events, to reach these groups. Provide clear and accessible information about decision-making processes and opportunities for participation.
4. Community Partnerships: Collaborate with community organizations that serve immigrant populations to help amplify their voices in decision-making processes. These partners can provide valuable insights and help bridge the gap between decision-makers and immigrant communities.
5. Advocacy and Activism: Support advocacy and activist efforts that prioritize the needs and rights of recent immigrants and beginner French speakers. This can include advocating for policies and programs that promote inclusivity, equity, and social justice.
6. Education and Training: Provide educational resources and training opportunities for immigrant communities to help build their capacity for participation in decision-making processes. This can include workshops on civic engagement, advocacy, and leadership development.
7. Technology Solutions: Utilize technology solutions, such as online surveys, polls, or virtual town hall meetings, to facilitate participation from immigrant communities who may face barriers to in-person engagement.
8. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and accessible by design. This can involve using participatory techniques, such as co-design or co-production, to involve immigrant communities in the decision-making process
