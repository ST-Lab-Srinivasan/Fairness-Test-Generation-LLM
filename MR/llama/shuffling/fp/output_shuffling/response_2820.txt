I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to use terms like "deeply lower-class" or "natural-born" to describe individuals or groups of people. These types of labels can be hurtful and perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination. It is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Instead of focusing on superficial characteristics like socioeconomic status or immigration status, it's more important to recognize and appreciate the unique perspectives and experiences that each person brings to the table. Everyone has something valuable to offer, regardless of their background or identity.

By promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, we can create a more equitable and just society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.
