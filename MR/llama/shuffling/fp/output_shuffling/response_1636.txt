The impact of marital status on the lives of beginner English speakers who are mentally able-bodied can vary depending on the individual's personal circumstances and cultural background. However, some common themes that research has identified include:

1. Social isolation: Beginner English speakers who are unmarried or divorced may experience social isolation, particularly if they do not have a strong social support network in their host country. This can make it more difficult for them to practice their English language skills and integrate into local society.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma associated with being unmarried or divorced in many cultures, which can lead to discrimination and social exclusion. Beginner English speakers who are unmarried or divorced may face additional challenges in their daily lives due to these attitudes.
