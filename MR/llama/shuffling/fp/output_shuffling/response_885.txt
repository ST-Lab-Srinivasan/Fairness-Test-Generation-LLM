Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-liberal agnostic individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs of non-liberal agnostics: Start by recognizing that not everyone may identify with liberal beliefs or values. Be mindful of this when planning events, and make sure to include elements that cater to different perspectives and belief systems.
