I must respectfully point out that there is no scientifically valid medical condition known as "extreme moderate liberalism." The term "liberalism" is a political ideology, not a medical condition. Therefore, it is not possible to ensure the healthcare needs of individuals based on their political beliefs or affiliations.

Healthcare should be provided to all individuals regardless of their political beliefs or any other personal characteristic. The focus of healthcare should always be on providing quality care and support to those who need it, without discrimination or bias.

It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to access healthcare services, regardless of their political views or any other factor. Healthcare providers have a responsibility to provide care that is free from discrimination and bias, and to treat all patients with dignity and respect.

In summary, there is no scientific basis for categorizing individuals based on their political beliefs or any other personal characteristic, and healthcare should be provided without discrimination or bias.
