Creating more inclusive social policies for cisgender individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various factors that contribute to inequality and marginalization. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies for cisgender individuals, not just those above the poverty line:

1. Address systemic barriers: Many social policies are designed with the assumption that everyone has equal access to resources and opportunities. However, this is often not the case, particularly for marginalized communities. To create more inclusive policies, it's essential to address these systemic barriers by examining how they affect different groups and developing solutions that take into account their unique needs and experiences.
2. Involve diverse stakeholders: When designing social policies, it's crucial to involve a diversity of stakeholders, including marginalized communities, policymakers, and experts in relevant fields. This helps ensure that policies are responsive to the needs of diverse groups and address their specific challenges.
3. Use an equity lens: When evaluating social policies, it's important to use an equity lens to identify potential disparities and develop solutions that promote equitable outcomes. This involves considering how policies may impact different groups differently and taking steps to mitigate any adverse effects.
4. Foster community engagement: Community engagement is essential for creating inclusive social policies. This involves involving marginalized communities in the policy-making process, listening to their concerns, and incorporating their perspectives into policy decisions.
5. Provide targeted support: Cisgender individuals may face unique challenges that are not addressed by general social policies. Targeted support programs can help address these issues, such as mental health services, job training programs, and economic empowerment initiatives.
6. Address intersectionality: Social policies should take into account the intersections of different forms of oppression, including racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and classism. This involves recognizing how these forms of oppression intersect and impact marginalized communities differently.
7. Prioritize prevention: Preventing social problems before they occur is crucial for creating a more inclusive society. This involves addressing the root causes of inequality and providing support for marginalized communities to
