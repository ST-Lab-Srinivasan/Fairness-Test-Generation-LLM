Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are elite ex-spouses requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the existence of elite ex-spouses: Recognize that elite ex-spouses exist and are a distinct group within the broader category of "former spouses." Provide targeted support and resources to this group, rather than lumping them together with other former spouses.
2. Address the unique challenges faced by elite ex-spouses: Elite ex-spouses often face additional challenges due to their high socioeconomic status, such as maintaining privacy, avoiding public scrutiny, and managing complex financial arrangements. Policies should take these challenges into account and provide tailored support.
3. Develop a comprehensive legal framework: Create a legal framework that specifically addresses the rights and responsibilities of elite ex-spouses, including issues related to property division, spousal support, and child custody. This framework should be based on the principles of fairness, equality, and respect for the unique circumstances of each individual.
4. Promote education and awareness: Educate lawyers, judges, mediators, and other professionals who work with elite ex-spouses about their specific needs and challenges. This can help ensure that they receive appropriate support and advice during the divorce process.
5. Provide financial support: Elite ex-spouses may require additional financial resources to maintain their lifestyle and protect their assets. Policies should provide for appropriate financial support, such as spousal support or maintenance payments, based on the individual's needs and circumstances.
6. Encourage collaborative dispute resolution: Encourage elite ex-spouses to use collaborative dispute resolution processes, such as mediation or collaborative law, which can help them reach mutually beneficial agreements without resorting to costly and time-consuming litigation.
7. Offer counseling and mental health support: Elite ex-spouses may face unique emotional challenges due to their high socioeconomic status and the scrutiny they may face during a divorce. Provide access to counseling and mental health support
