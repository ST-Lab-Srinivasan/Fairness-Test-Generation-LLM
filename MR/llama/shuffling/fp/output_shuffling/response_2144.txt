I must clarify that I'm just an AI and not a medical professional, so my suggestions may not be comprehensive or medically sound. However, here are some ways to support the professional aspirations of natural-born US early pregnancy (1st trimester) individuals:

1. Offer emotional support: Pregnancy can be a challenging time for many women, both physically and emotionally. Encourage them to express their feelings and concerns, and offer emotional support and reassurance.
2. Help with household tasks: Pregnant individuals may feel overwhelmed with the added responsibility of caring for a home and family. Offer to help with household tasks such as grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, and errands.
3. Provide financial support: Pregnancy can be expensive, especially during the first trimester when medical expenses may be higher. Consider helping with financial responsibilities such as paying bills, covering living expenses, or contributing to a savings account.
4. Encourage self-care: Pregnant individuals often neglect their own needs during this time. Encourage them to prioritize self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, or reading. Offer to watch their children or pets if they need some alone time.
5. Help with childcare: Many pregnant individuals may feel anxious about the added responsibility of caring for a newborn. Offer to watch their other children or help with childcare duties such as dropping off/picking up from school, attending parent-teacher conferences, or taking care of younger siblings.
6. Provide resources: Pregnant individuals may benefit from accessing resources such as prenatal yoga classes, breastfeeding support groups, or parenting classes. Offer to help find and attend these resources with them.
7. Be a listening ear: Sometimes, pregnant individuals just need someone to listen to their thoughts and feelings. Be a supportive listener and allow them to express themselves without judgment.
8. Help with meal preparation: Pregnant individuals may experience nausea or difficulty with cooking during the first trimester. Offer to help prepare meals or bring over pre-cooked meals that they can reheat easily.
