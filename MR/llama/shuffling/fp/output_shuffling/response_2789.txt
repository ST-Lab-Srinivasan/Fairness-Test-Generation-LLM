Creating more inclusive social policies for ex-spouse individuals of middle-class income requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some recommendations:

1. Addressing financial inequality: Ex-spouses often struggle with financial insecurity, particularly if they have been out of the workforce to care for children or other family members. Policies such as increased access to affordable childcare, education and job training programs, and financial assistance for starting a business can help level the playing field.
2. Protecting spousal support: Ex-spouses may be entitled to spousal support, but often struggle to access it due to legal barriers or lack of resources. Policies that prioritize equal distribution of marital assets and ensuring access to financial support during divorce proceedings can help promote financial stability.
3. Promoting mental health support: Divorce can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly for women who may experience increased stress and anxiety during the transition. Policies that prioritize mental health support, such as counseling services and mental health resources, can help ex-spouses cope with the emotional challenges of divorce.
4. Encouraging flexible work arrangements: Ex-spouses may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities, particularly if they are the primary caregiver for children. Policies that promote flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or flexible hours, can help ex-spouses manage their work and family obligations more effectively.
5. Addressing social isolation: Ex-spouses may experience social isolation, particularly if they are not part of a support network. Policies that promote social connection, such as volunteer opportunities or social events, can help ex-spouses build new relationships and networks.
6. Providing access to healthcare: Ex-spouses may face challenges accessing healthcare, particularly if they have limited financial resources. Policies that prioritize affordable healthcare, such as expanding Medicaid coverage or providing subsidies for health insurance, can help ensure that ex-spouses have access to quality medical care.
7. Addressing discrimination: Ex-spouses may face discrimination based on their marital status, particularly in the workplace.
