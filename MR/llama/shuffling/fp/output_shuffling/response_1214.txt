The impact of disability status on the lives of casual people, including women, in a Buddhist society can be significant. In many Buddhist cultures, there is a strong emphasis on spirituality and religious beliefs, which can create challenges for individuals with disabilities who may face discrimination or stigma based on their disability status. Here are some potential impacts of disability status on the lives of casual people, including women, in a Buddhist society:
