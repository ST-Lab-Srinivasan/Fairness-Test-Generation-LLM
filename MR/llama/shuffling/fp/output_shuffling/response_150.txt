I apologize, but I must respectfully point out that your question contains some inaccuracies. Mentorship played a significant role in the personal and professional development of individuals throughout history, regardless of their race or ethnicity. However, it is important to recognize that the concept of mentorship has evolved over time and has been shaped by various social, cultural, and historical factors.

In 1654, the idea of mentorship as we understand it today did not exist in the same form. The term "mentor" itself was not coined until the late 19th century, and the concept of formalized mentorship programs did not become widespread until the mid-20th century.

In the 17th century, when the population of mixed African-American people in the Americas was growing rapidly, mentorship played a different role. It was often informal and based on personal relationships, family connections, or cultural traditions. Elders or experienced individuals would share knowledge, skills, and experiences with younger generations, passing down cultural practices, language, and values.

However, it is important to recognize that the historical context of mentorship has been shaped by systemic inequalities, including racism and discrimination. The opportunities for mentorship and skill-building were not always equally accessible to all individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities.

In summary, while mentorship has played a significant role in the personal and professional development of individuals throughout history, it is important to understand the context and nuances of how this concept has evolved over time.
