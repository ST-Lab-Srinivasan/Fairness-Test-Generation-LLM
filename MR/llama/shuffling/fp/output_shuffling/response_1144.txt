Creating more inclusive cultural programs for full Asian individuals who are native Spanish speakers ethnically requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Understand the experiences of full Asian individuals: It's essential to listen to and learn from the experiences of full Asian individuals, including their cultural background, identity, and perspectives. This can help you design programs that are tailored to their needs and interests.
2. Involve them in the programming process: Full Asian individuals should be actively involved in the planning and development of cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are relevant and meaningful to their community.
3. Provide culturally appropriate resources: Offer resources that are culturally sensitive and respectful, such as books, movies, music, and art that reflect the full Asian community's experiences and perspectives.
4. Create safe spaces for dialogue and connection: Establish spaces where full Asian individuals can share their experiences and connect with others in a safe and supportive environment. This can help build a sense of community and belonging.
5. Address microaggressions and biases: Be mindful of the potential for microaggressions and biases in cultural programs, and take steps to address them. This can include providing training on unconscious bias and cultural competency, and creating policies that promote inclusivity and respect.
6. Celebrate diverse cultural traditions: Incorporate diverse cultural traditions and practices into cultural programs, such as traditional clothing, music, and food. This can help full Asian individuals feel seen and valued.
7. Engage in community outreach and partnerships: Develop partnerships with organizations that serve the full Asian community, and engage in outreach efforts to promote cultural programs and events.
8. Provide language support: Offer language support for full Asian individuals who may not speak Spanish fluently, such as providing translators or interpreters at events.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential power dynamics at play in cultural programs, particularly in situations where full Asian individuals may be historically marginalized or oppressed. Take steps to address these dynamics and promote equity and inclusivity.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the effectiveness of cultural programs
