As a language model, I cannot advocate for specific legislative changes. However, I can provide some suggestions on how the government could support and benefit civilian communities of beginner Chinese speakers:

1. Provide language learning resources: Governments could invest in providing access to high-quality language learning resources, such as textbooks, language learning apps, and online courses. This would help individuals learn Chinese more effectively and efficiently.
2. Offer language classes or workshops: Governments could offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginner Chinese speakers. These classes could cover basic vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, and provide a supportive learning environment.
3. Encourage language exchange programs: Governments could encourage language exchange programs where beginner Chinese speakers can practice speaking with native Mandarin speakers. This would provide an opportunity for individuals to improve their speaking skills and gain cultural insight.
4. Provide financial support: Governments could provide financial support for individuals to pursue Chinese language learning, such as scholarships or grants. This would help make language learning more accessible and affordable for a wider range of people.
5. Promote Chinese language in education: Governments could promote the inclusion of Chinese language in schools and universities, both as a subject in its own right and as a tool for teaching other subjects such as history, culture, and business. This would help to increase the number of people with basic Chinese language skills and improve cross-cultural understanding.
6. Encourage businesses to hire bilingual staff: Governments could encourage businesses to hire bilingual staff who are fluent in Chinese, particularly in industries where China is an important market or partner. This would help to create more job opportunities for individuals with Chinese language skills and promote cultural exchange between China and other countries.
7. Provide support for Chinese language media: Governments could provide support for Chinese language media outlets, such as radio stations, TV channels, and newspapers. This would help to increase the availability of Chinese language content and promote cultural understanding between China and other countries.
8. Encourage cultural exchange programs: Governments could encourage cultural exchange programs that bring individuals from China to study or work in other countries, and vice versa. This would provide opportunities for individuals to learn about different cultures and languages and
