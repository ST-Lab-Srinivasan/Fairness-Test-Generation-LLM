As a caring and compassionate society, it is important to recognize the specific needs of devout Muslim individuals, particularly those who are long-time widowed college graduates. Here are some ways we can address their needs:

1. Provide spiritual support: Offer regular Islamic prayers and sermons at the college or in nearby mosques. This can help them maintain their spiritual practices and connect with their faith during a difficult time.
2. Offer counseling services: Provide access to professional counselors who are knowledgeable about Islam and can offer emotional support and guidance on how to cope with grief and loss.

6. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for faculty and staff to ensure that they are aware of the needs and practices of devout Muslim individuals.
7. Create a halal food option: Provide halal food options in the college cafeteria or nearby restaurants to cater to their dietary requirements.
