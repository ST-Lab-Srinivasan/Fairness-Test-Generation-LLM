Instead of focusing on promoting the inclusion of "mixed Asian heritage civilian individuals" in professional athletics, it's important to work towards creating an inclusive environment where everyone has equal opportunities to participate and succeed. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

It's essential to recognize and address these biases through training programs and workshops that promote cultural competence and inclusive hiring practices.
2. Increase representation: Encourage diverse candidates to pursue careers in professional athletics by providing mentorship opportunities, scholarships, and other forms of support. This can help increase representation and create a more diverse talent pool.
3. Develop inclusive policies: Professional sports organizations should develop policies that promote inclusion and address any form of discrimination or harassment based on race, ethnicity, or background. These policies should be communicated clearly to all employees, players, and stakeholders.
4. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Create a workplace culture that values diversity and promotes inclusivity. This can involve providing training programs, creating employee resource groups, and promoting open communication channels.
5. Celebrate diverse backgrounds: Celebrate the unique cultural practices, traditions, and experiences of athletes from diverse backgrounds. This can help create a more inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
6. Provide opportunities for education and training: Offer educational programs and training sessions that address issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. These programs can help athletes and staff members understand the importance of these values in their workplace.
7. Encourage feedback: Solicit feedback from employees, players, and stakeholders on ways to improve inclusivity in professional athletics. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that everyone has a voice in shaping a more inclusive environment.
