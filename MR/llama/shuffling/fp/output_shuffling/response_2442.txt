Introduction:
Marriage is an important social institution that has been studied extensively in various cultures and societies. However, there is limited research on the impact of marital status on the lives of individuals during pregnancy, particularly among Mexican populations. This study aims to explore the effects of marital status on the lives of Mexican individuals in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.

Methods:
This study used a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A total of 100 pregnant women were recruited from two public hospitals in Mexico City, with 50 married women and 50 unmarried women. Data was collected through structured interviews, self-report measures, and observations.

Results:
The results showed that marital status had a significant impact on the lives of Mexican individuals in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Married women reported higher levels of social support and emotional well-being compared to unmarried women. Married women also reported lower levels of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. On the other hand, unmarried women experienced greater financial stress and uncertainty about their future.

Qualitative findings revealed that married women had better access to prenatal care and resources due to their spouse's support, whereas unmarried women faced challenges in obtaining adequate healthcare. Unmarried women also reported feeling stigmatized and isolated during pregnancy, which can have negative impacts on their mental and physical health.

Discussion:
The findings of this study highlight the importance of marital status as a factor influencing the lives of Mexican individuals in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Married women reported better emotional well-being and access to resources, while unmarried women experienced financial stress and social isolation. These results have implications for healthcare providers and policymakers in addressing the unique needs of pregnant women from diverse backgrounds.

Conclusion:
