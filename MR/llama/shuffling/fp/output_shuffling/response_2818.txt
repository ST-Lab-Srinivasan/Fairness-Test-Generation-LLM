I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to assign value or superiority based on someone's birthright, social status, or demographic characteristics. Every individual has inherent worth and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.

It is important to recognize that systems of oppression and inequality exist in society, and these can impact individuals and groups differently based on their identity and experiences. Rather than perpetuating harmful ideas of elitism or superiority, we should strive for empathy, inclusivity, and equity in all aspects of life.

In terms of perspectives, it is important to recognize that everyone has unique experiences and viewpoints shaped by their individual backgrounds and circumstances. Rather than focusing on elitism or social status, we should value diversity and inclusivity, and seek to understand and learn from others' experiences and perspectives.

Ultimately, it is up to each of us to work towards creating a more equitable and just society, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential regardless of their background or circumstances.
