Supporting the economic empowerment of lower-income Native natural-born US citizen individuals is crucial for promoting equity and bridging the wealth gap in the United States. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Provide access to education and job training programs: Many lower-income Native Americans face barriers to accessing quality education, which hinders their ability to secure better-paying jobs. Investing in educational programs, including vocational training and degree programs, can help individuals acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market.
2. Encourage entrepreneurship: Supporting Native American entrepreneurs through access to capital, mentorship, and resources can help create new economic opportunities and jobs within their communities. This can be achieved through initiatives such as business incubators, loan funds, and training programs.
3. Foster partnerships between tribal communities and corporations: Collaborating with major corporations can provide access to new markets, technologies, and resources for Native American businesses. These partnerships can also help address issues related to economic development and job creation within the community.
4. Invest in infrastructure and housing: Investing in infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and utilities, can help improve the quality of life for Native Americans living on reservations. Additionally, providing affordable housing options can help lower-income individuals save money on housing costs, which can be reinvested into their communities.
5. Implement policies to address systemic barriers: Discriminatory practices and lack of access to resources have historically hindered the economic progress of Native Americans. Policies aimed at addressing these systemic barriers, such as land reform, cultural preservation, and tribal sovereignty, can help level the playing field for lower-income individuals.
6. Support local food systems: Encouraging local food systems and agriculture can provide economic opportunities for Native American communities while promoting sustainable practices and cultural preservation. This can involve initiatives such as farmer training programs, market development, and food distribution networks.
7. Promote cultural tourism: Highlighting the cultural heritage of Native American communities through cultural tourism can provide economic opportunities for local businesses and individuals
