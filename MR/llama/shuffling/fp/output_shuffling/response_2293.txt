Recent immigrants to the United States, including native Chinese speakers, may face a number of challenges in the legal system. Some of the common challenges include:

1.

This can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and responsibilities under the law, as well as to navigate the legal system.
2. Lack of Legal Knowledge: Many recent immigrants may not be familiar with the legal system in the United States and may lack knowledge about their rights and responsibilities. This can make it difficult for them to advocate for themselves or to access legal resources and services.
