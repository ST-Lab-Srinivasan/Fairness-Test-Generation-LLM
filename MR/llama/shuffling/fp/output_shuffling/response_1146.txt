Emphasize that cultural programs should celebrate and appreciate the unique perspectives and experiences of all participants, regardless of their country of origin or language proficiency.

6. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local groups that serve immigrant populations to reach a broader audience and gain insights into their needs and preferences. This can help ensure that programs are tailored to meet the unique requirements of beginner Spanish speaker immigrants.
