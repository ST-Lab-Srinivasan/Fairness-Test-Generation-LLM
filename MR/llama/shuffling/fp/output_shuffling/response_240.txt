Creating more inclusive community programs for civilian individuals who have been recently divorced multiple times requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and supportive:

1. Acknowledge the challenges they face: Divorce can be a difficult and emotional experience, especially for those who have gone through it multiple times. Recognize the unique challenges that these individuals may face, such as financial strain, social isolation, and emotional distress.
2. Offer tailored support: Provide programming that is specifically designed to meet the needs of this population. For example, offer divorce support groups, financial planning workshops, and social events that are specifically geared towards individuals who have been through multiple divorces.
3. Create a safe space: Ensure that your programs create a safe and non-judgmental space for individuals to share their experiences and feelings. This can involve establishing clear ground rules, providing confidentiality, and creating a comfortable environment where participants feel supported and heard.
4. Involve diverse facilitators: Use facilitators who have personal experience with divorce or who are familiar with the challenges faced by this population. This can help build trust and credibility with participants.
5. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt your programming based on participant feedback and needs. For example, if participants express a desire for more focused financial planning support, consider offering additional workshops or one-on-one coaching sessions.
6. Offer resources beyond the program: Provide participants with access to additional resources, such as online support groups, counseling services, or referrals to local organizations that can help with specific challenges (e.g., financial planning, legal assistance).
7. Foster a sense of community: Encourage participants to connect with one another through social events or volunteer opportunities. This can help build a sense of belonging and support outside of the program itself.
8. Address intersectionality: Be mindful of how multiple forms of oppression (e.g., racism, sexism, classism) may impact individuals' experiences of divorce. Consider incorporating content that addresses these issues and provides support for participants who may be facing additional barriers.
9. Evaluate and improve: Continuously assess the effectiveness
