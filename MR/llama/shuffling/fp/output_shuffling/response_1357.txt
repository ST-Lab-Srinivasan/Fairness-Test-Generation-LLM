Recent native Spanish speaker immigrants to the United States may face a number of challenges within the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many recent immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties when interacting with law enforcement, courts, and other legal entities. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and delays in the resolution of legal issues.
2. Lack of familiarity with US laws and procedures: Immigrants may be unfamiliar with the laws and procedures of the United States, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system. This can lead to mistakes or misunderstandings that can have serious consequences.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Many recent immigrants may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or other support services. This can make it difficult for them to obtain the necessary help and advice when dealing with legal issues.
4. Discrimination and bias: Recent immigrants may face discrimination and bias within the legal system, particularly if they are of color or from a marginalized community. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and make it more difficult for them to access justice.
5. Difficulty navigating the complexities of US immigration law: The US immigration system is complex and can be difficult for even native-born citizens to navigate. Recent immigrants may face additional challenges in understanding and complying with these laws, which can lead to difficulties in obtaining legal status or resolving immigration-related issues.
6. Fear of deportation: Many recent immigrants may live in constant fear of deportation, which can make it difficult for them to seek legal assistance or access justice within the system. This fear can also lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can further complicate their ability to navigate the legal system.
7. Limited access to social services: Recent immigrants may have limited access to social services such as healthcare, education, and housing. This can make it difficult for them to address non-legal issues that may be related to their legal problems.
8. Lack of trust in the legal system: Some recent immigrants may not trust the legal system due to past experiences or cultural beliefs.
