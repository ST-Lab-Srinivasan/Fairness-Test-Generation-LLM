Creating more inclusive cultural programs for mixed African-American individuals who are native English speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the complexity of mixed identity: Mixed African-Americans may experience a range of identities, including Black, White, Native American, Latino/a, Asian, or multiracial. Be aware of the complexities of their identities and avoid reducing them to a single label.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs include a diversity of voices, experiences, and perspectives. This can be achieved by incorporating stories, music, dance, art, or other forms of expression from different cultures and communities.
3. Foster inclusive environments: Create spaces where mixed African-American individuals feel welcome and included. Encourage participation and engagement from all members of the community, regardless of their racial or ethnic background.
4. Challenge stereotypes and biases: Recognize and challenge any biases or stereotypes that may be perpetuated through cultural programs. Avoid perpetuating harmful representations of mixed race individuals or communities.
5. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in cultural programs, particularly those created by dominant groups. Use your position to amplify marginalized voices and create spaces for underrepresented groups to share their experiences and perspectives.
6. Provide opportunities for dialogue and collaboration: Create spaces for mixed African-American individuals to engage in dialogue and collaboration with one another. Encourage mutual understanding, respect, and support among community members.
7. Support intergenerational connections: Connect mixed African-American individuals with elders and younger generations within their communities. This can help build a sense of belonging and cultural continuity across different racial and ethnic backgrounds.
8. Engage in ongoing self-reflection and evaluation: Continuously reflect on your own biases and assumptions, as well as the impact of cultural programs on mixed African-American individuals. Be open to feedback and willing to make changes based on this feedback.
9. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for mixed African-American individuals to connect with one another and build relationships across different racial and ethnic backgrounds.
