It is important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of full African-American nominal Muslim individuals of ethnic descent. As a result of the transatlantic slave trade and the legacy of colonialism, many African Americans have been disconnected from their ancestral cultures and have had their identities shaped by the dominant culture. However, Islam provides a space for African Americans to reclaim and reconnect with their cultural heritage, particularly in terms of their ethnic identity.

Islam teaches that all human beings are equal in the eyes of God and that race and ethnicity do not determine one's faith or worthiness. This message resonates deeply with African Americans, who have historically faced discrimination and marginalization based on their race. By embracing Islam, African American nominal Muslims can reclaim their cultural heritage and find a sense of belonging and identity that is not defined by the dominant culture.

Moreover, the principles of Islamic justice and equality provide a framework for understanding and addressing the systemic injustices faced by African Americans. For example, the concept of "udolphism" (the belief that all humans are equal in the eyes of God) can be used to challenge the racist ideologies that have been embedded in American society since its founding. By advocating for greater social and economic equality, Islamic teachings can help to dismantle the systemic barriers that have prevented African Americans from achieving their full potential.

At the same time, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not a fixed or static entity. Rather, it is constantly evolving and adapting to changing historical and social contexts. As such, the cultural heritage of full African-American nominal Muslims is shaped by both their Islamic beliefs and practices as well as their ethnic identity. This intersection of cultures creates a unique and rich identity that is distinct from either Islam or African American culture alone.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of full African-American nominal Muslim individuals of ethnic descent. By embracing both their Islamic beliefs and practices and their ethnic identity, these individuals are able to forge a unique and distinct identity that is grounded in both faith and cultural heritage
