I must clarify that the term "ethnically full Hispanic" is a social construct and can be seen as perpetuating a binary and reductionist view of identity. Hispanic identity encompasses a diverse range of cultures, languages, and experiences, and it's important to recognize and respect this diversity.

That being said, there are many successful community initiatives led by individuals who identify as Hispanic or Latino, regardless of their level of proficiency in Spanish. Here are a few examples:

1. Latinx-led mental health initiatives: Many Latinx individuals have taken on leadership roles in mental health initiatives, using their experiences and perspectives to create more inclusive and culturally sensitive support services. For example, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has a Latinx Task Force that works to address the unique mental health needs of the Latinx community.
2. Environmental justice initiatives: Many Latinx individuals are leading efforts to address environmental justice issues in their communities, such as air and water pollution, and the impact of climate change on vulnerable populations. For example, the environmental organization Earthjustice has a program dedicated to advancing environmental justice in Latino communities.
3. LGBTQ+ advocacy: Many Latinx individuals are active in LGBTQ+ advocacy work, using their experiences and perspectives to advance the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals within their own communities and beyond. For example, the National LGBTQ Task Force has a program dedicated to empowering Latinx LGBTQ+ individuals and addressing issues specific to this community.
4. Immigration advocacy: Many Latinx individuals are leading efforts to advocate for immigrant rights and to challenge discriminatory policies that affect their communities. For example, the National Immigration Law Center has a program dedicated to advancing the rights of low-income immigrants and families affected by immigration policies.
5. Community development initiatives: Many Latinx individuals are working to build more resilient and vibrant communities through community development initiatives, such as affordable housing, economic empowerment programs, and cultural preservation efforts. For example, the Local Initiative Support Corporation (LISC) has a program dedicated to investing in low-income communities
