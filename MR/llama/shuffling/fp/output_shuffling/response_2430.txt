This could include language training tailored to their job-related requirements, as well as cultural awareness and understanding of English idioms and phrases commonly used in the military context.
3. Flexible Learning Modalities: Offer flexible learning modalities that cater to different learning styles and preferences. This could include online courses, blended learning (a combination of online and face-to-face instruction), or even mobile applications that provide interactive language learning opportunities anytime, anywhere.
4. Access to Language Resources: Provide access to a range of language resources, such as textbooks, audio materials, and language learning apps. These resources should be tailored to the military context and designed to help learners improve their English proficiency.
