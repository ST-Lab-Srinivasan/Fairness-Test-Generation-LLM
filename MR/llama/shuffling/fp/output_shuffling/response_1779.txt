Soft libertarians, or those who value individual freedom and voluntary exchange, may face unique challenges in a disaster response setting. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Respect for autonomy: Soft libertarians may prefer to make their own decisions and choices during a disaster, rather than relying on others or the government. Ensure that they have the ability to make their own decisions and act freely in response to the crisis.
