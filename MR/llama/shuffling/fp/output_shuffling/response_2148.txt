Creating more inclusive social policies for mid-50s strong atheist individuals requires recognizing and addressing the unique challenges they may face due to their lack of belief in a higher power. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the discrimination: Strong atheists, especially those in their mid-50s, may have faced discrimination or prejudice based on their beliefs. Policies should actively work to combat this discrimination and promote acceptance and understanding.
2. Advocate for freedom of religion and belief: Mid-50s strong atheists should be free to hold their beliefs without fear of persecution or discrimination. Social policies should advocate for the protection of this right, including the right to express one's beliefs publicly without fear of reprisal.
3. Promote education and awareness: Many people may not fully understand or appreciate the atheist perspective. Educational programs and campaigns can help promote greater understanding and acceptance of atheism, reducing stigma and discrimination.
4. Encourage inclusive language and terminology: Social policies should use inclusive language and terminology that acknowledges the diversity of belief systems. This can help create a more welcoming environment for mid-50s strong atheists and other non-believers.
5. Support secular community spaces: Mid-50s strong atheists may feel isolated or excluded from religious communities. Social policies should support the creation of secular community spaces where individuals can gather, socialize, and find support without pressure to conform to religious beliefs.
6. Advocate for access to healthcare and social services: Mid-50s strong atheists may face barriers when accessing healthcare or social services due to their belief system. Social policies should advocate for the removal of these barriers and ensure that all individuals have equal access to these services, regardless of their beliefs.
7. Promote critical thinking and skepticism: Mid-50s strong atheists may be interested in promoting critical thinking and skepticism in society. Social policies should support initiatives that encourage critical thinking and skepticism, such as science education programs or critical thinking workshops.
8. Address ageism and ableism
