Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for beginner Chinese speakers, including those who are partly asexual, requires thoughtful planning and consideration of diverse perspectives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Encourage participation from a wide range of individuals, including those who identify as LGBTQ+, to ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of the community.
2. Provide gender-neutral options: Offer gender-neutral options for gifts, decorations, and other elements of the celebration to make it more inclusive for partly asexual individuals.
3. Avoid binary language: Use language that avoids binary definitions of gender and sexuality, such as using "everyone" instead of "guys" or "girls."
4. Incorporate diverse imagery: Use images and symbols that represent a variety of cultures, identities, and experiences to create a more inclusive atmosphere.
5. Foster a respectful environment: Encourage respectful communication and behavior among participants to create a welcoming and inclusive space for everyone.
6. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and perspectives of LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who are partly asexual, and share that knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Recognize that power dynamics can play a significant role in cultural celebrations, and work to create a more equitable distribution of power among participants.
8. Create safe spaces: Designate areas where individuals can feel safe and comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or rejection.
9. Offer alternative ways to participate: Provide options for individuals who may not identify with traditional gender or sexuality norms, such as observing from a distance or participating in a different capacity.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the inclusivity of cultural celebrations and make adjustments as needed to ensure that they are welcoming and respectful of all individuals involved.

By implementing these strategies, beginner Chinese speakers can create more inclusive cultural celebrations for partly asexual individuals, fostering a sense of belonging and community for everyone involved.
