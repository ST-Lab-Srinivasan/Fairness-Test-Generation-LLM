Addressing the needs of native English speaker individuals in disaster response can be challenging, especially when they are from an upper middle-income background. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Upper middle-income countries have diverse populations with different cultural backgrounds and values. Providing cultural sensitivity training for native English speakers can help them understand the local culture and customs, which is essential in building trust and rapport with affected communities.
