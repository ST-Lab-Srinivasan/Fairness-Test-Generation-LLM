Ensuring that the voices of marginalized communities, including full Asian individuals and ethnically diverse Arabic speakers, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for creating a more equitable and inclusive society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen to their stories: Hearing the personal experiences and stories of marginalized communities can help decision-makers understand the challenges they face and why their voices matter.
