Addressing the specific needs of recent Native immigrants to the US, who are not in a relationship, can be a complex and nuanced process. Here are some key considerations for educators and administrators:

1. Cultural competency training: Provide training on the cultural practices, beliefs, and values of Native American communities for all educators and staff. This can help to create a more inclusive and respectful learning environment.
2. Hiring Native American staff: Consider hiring staff members who are Native American or have experience working with Native American communities. This can help to provide role models and mentors for students, as well as add diversity to the school's staff.
3. Incorporating Native American content into the curriculum: Incorporate content related to Native American history, culture, and contributions into the curriculum. This can help to increase cultural understanding and appreciation, as well as provide opportunities for students to learn about their own heritage.
4. Creating a safe space: Create a safe and inclusive space for recent Native immigrants to share their experiences and feel supported. This can involve creating a dedicated space or time for students to connect with each other and with school staff, or hosting cultural events and activities that promote cultural exchange and understanding.
5. Providing mental health support: Many recent Native immigrants may have experienced trauma related to their migration to the US. Provide access to mental health services and resources, such as counseling or therapy, to help students manage any emotional challenges they may be facing.
6. Building partnerships with Native American communities: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities to provide opportunities for students to engage in cultural exchange programs, internships, and other experiences that promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
7. Creating a welcoming environment: Ensure that the school is a welcoming and inclusive environment for recent Native immigrants. This can involve promoting language access and cultural support services, such as interpreters or translators, and providing resources to help students navigate the educational system.
8. Encouraging student leadership: Encourage recent Native immigrant students to take on leadership roles within the school or community. This can help to build confidence and sense of belonging, as well as provide opportunities for students to develop important life skills.
