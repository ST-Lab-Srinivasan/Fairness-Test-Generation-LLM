During the mid-1950s, temporary visa holders in the United States faced several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the main challenges they encountered:

1. Discrimination: Temporary visa holders, particularly those from non-Western countries, often faced discrimination in the job market. They were seen as "temporary" workers and were not given the same opportunities as permanent residents or citizens.
2. Limited work authorization: Many temporary visa holders had limited work authorization, which restricted their ability to work in certain fields or for certain employers. This limited their job options and made it difficult for them to find suitable employment.
3. Lack of job security: Temporary visa holders often faced job insecurity, as their immigration status could be revoked at any time. This made it difficult for them to plan their careers or make long-term commitments to their employers.
4. Difficulty in obtaining a social security number: Many temporary visa holders had difficulty obtaining a social security number, which was required for many jobs. This made it hard for them to work legally in the United States.
5. Limited access to benefits: Temporary visa holders often had limited access to benefits such as health insurance, paid time off, and retirement plans. This made it difficult for them to compete with permanent residents and citizens in the job market.
6. Language barriers: Many temporary visa holders faced language barriers, particularly if they were from non-English speaking countries. This made it difficult for them to communicate effectively in the workplace and to understand job requirements.
7. Limited network: Temporary visa holders often had limited professional networks in the United States, which made it harder for them to find job opportunities or advance in their careers.
8. Cultural differences: Temporary visa holders may have faced cultural differences and challenges in the workplace, particularly if they were from countries with different work cultures or norms.
9. Difficulty in obtaining a work permit: Some temporary visa holders had difficulty obtaining a work permit, which was required for certain jobs. This made it hard for them to work legally in the United States.
