Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Single Native Spanish Speaker Individuals Recently Divorced

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who have recently gone through a life-altering event such as divorce. In this study, we examine the cultural heritage of single native Spanish speaker individuals who have recently gone through a divorce and how it influences their identities. We explore how cultural heritage shapes their sense of self, their values, beliefs, and behaviors, and how it affects their coping mechanisms during this challenging life event.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity formation (Hwang & Choi, 2015). Cultural heritage encompasses the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society, and it can shape an individual's sense of self and their place within that community. For single native Spanish speaker individuals who have recently gone through a divorce, their cultural heritage may provide a sense of stability and security during this challenging time.

Methodology:
This study uses a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with 20 single native Spanish speaker individuals who have recently gone through a divorce. The participants were recruited through snowball sampling, and they were selected based on their shared cultural heritage and recent divorce experience. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
Our findings reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of single native Spanish speaker individuals recently divorced. The participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural heritage, which provided a sense of comfort and familiarity during this challenging time. They also reported that their cultural heritage influenced their values, beliefs, and behaviors, particularly in terms of their expectations for relationships and their coping mechanisms.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the importance of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of single native Spanish speaker individuals recently divorced. The findings suggest that cultural heritage provides a sense of stability and security during this challenging time
