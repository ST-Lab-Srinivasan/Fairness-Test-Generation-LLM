2. Be mindful of diverse perspectives: Ensure that the event is respectful and inclusive of all attendees, regardless of their beliefs or practices.
3. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for attendees who may have different needs, such as wheelchair accessibility or interpretation services.
4. Encourage dialogue: Create opportunities for attendees to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with one another.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where all attendees feel welcome and included, and where they can express themselves freely without fear of judgment or discrimination.
