When responding to a disaster, it's essential to consider the unique needs of moderate conservative individuals who have been divorced multiple times. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Recognize and respect their privacy: Moderate conservatives may feel uncomfortable seeking help or disclosing personal information, especially if they have been through multiple divorces. Respect their privacy and only ask for information that is necessary for the response effort.
