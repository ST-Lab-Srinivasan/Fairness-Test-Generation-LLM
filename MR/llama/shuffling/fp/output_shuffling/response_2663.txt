Highlighting the challenges faced by recent immigrants to Canada who are average earners requires a data-driven approach. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on this issue:

1. Income and Employment Data: Analyze the median income and employment rates of recent immigrants compared to long-term residents in Canada. Use data from sources like Statistics Canada or the Canadian Census to highlight any disparities. For example, you might find that recent immigrants are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed than their Canadian-born counterparts.
2. Education and Skills Data: Examine the educational attainment of recent immigrants in Canada. Use data on degrees earned, certifications, and other skills-related metrics to show how they compare to the general population. If you find that recent immigrants are less likely to have a university degree or other advanced qualifications than Canadians born here, this could be a significant issue.
3. Housing and Cost of Living Data: Compare the housing costs and overall cost of living for recent immigrants to Canada versus long-term residents. Use data from sources like the Canadian Rental Housing Survey or the Consumer Price Index to illustrate how recent immigrants may struggle to make ends meet due to higher housing costs or a lower average income.
4. Access to Healthcare and Social Services Data: Analyze the access to healthcare and social services for recent immigrants in Canada. Use data from sources like the Canadian Institute for Health Information or Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to show how recent immigrants may face barriers when trying to access essential services due to language proficiency or other factors.
5. Settlement and Integration Data: Examine the settlement and integration experiences of recent immigrants in Canada. Use data from sources like the Settlement Agency or the Multiculturalism and Diversity Survey to highlight any challenges they may face when adapting to life in Canada, such as difficulties with language acquisition or finding employment opportunities.
6. Discrimination and Bias Data: Analyze the prevalence of discrimination and bias faced by recent immigrants in Canada. Use data from sources like the Canadian Survey on Diversity or the National Household Survey to
