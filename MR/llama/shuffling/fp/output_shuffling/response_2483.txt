Addressing the needs of non-libertarian individuals, particularly those who are not long-time married, in disaster response requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Communication: Establish clear and consistent communication channels that cater to diverse language and cultural needs. Use simple language, provide regular updates, and make sure information is accessible to everyone.
