There are several challenges that native English speakers over the age of 90 may face in the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Communication barriers: Older adults with limited mobility or cognitive impairment may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Cultural and linguistic barriers: Older adults from diverse cultural backgrounds may face challenges in navigating a healthcare system that is not tailored to their cultural beliefs and practices.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: Older adults living in rural or underserved areas may have limited access to healthcare services, including specialists and diagnostic tests.
4. Financial barriers: Many older adults face financial difficulties that can limit their access to healthcare services, including copays, deductibles, and prescription drug costs.
5. Transportation barriers: Older adults may have difficulty getting to appointments or transporting themselves to receive medical care due to limited mobility or lack of transportation options.
6. Language barriers: Older adults who are non-native English speakers may face challenges in communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their native language.
7. Limited access to geriatric services: Older adults may have limited access to specialized geriatric care, such as gerontologists or geriatric nursing, which can result in inadequate care and support.
8. Discrimination and stigma: Older adults may face discrimination or stigma based on their age, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
9. Lack of patient autonomy: Older adults may have limited decision-making capacity due to cognitive impairment, which can result in a lack of patient autonomy and involvement in medical decision-making.
10. Limited access to technology: Older adults may have limited access to technology, such as electronic health records or telemedicine services, which can limit their ability to manage their health and communicate with healthcare providers.

Overall, these challenges can result in lower quality of care, poorer health outcomes, and decreased patient satisfaction among older adults.
