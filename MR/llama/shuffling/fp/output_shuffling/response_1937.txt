I'm glad you're interested in creating more inclusive community events! However, I must respectfully point out that Nigeria did not exist as a country in 1915, as it gained independence from British colonial rule in 1960. Therefore, it is not possible to create community events for people aged 65 in Nigeria in 1915.

However, I understand your interest in creating inclusive events for seniors in Nigeria today. Here are some suggestions on how to make your community events more welcoming and accessible to older adults:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite older adults to participate in the planning and decision-making process for the event. This will give them a sense of ownership and make them feel valued.
2. Provide accessible venues and transportation: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for seniors, with ramps or elevators for those with mobility issues. Offer transportation options to help older adults get to the event, such as shuttle buses or carpooling opportunities.
3. Cater to their interests: Consider the hobbies and interests of older adults when planning the event. For example, you could include activities like arts and crafts, gardening, or sports.
4. Provide amenities for their comfort: Offer comfortable seating and shade for outdoor events, as well as cool drinks and snacks to help keep them hydrated and energized.
5. Promote the event through multiple channels: Reach out to local organizations that cater to older adults, such as senior centers or retirement communities, to promote the event. You could also use social media platforms or community newsletters to spread the word.

Remember, inclusivity is key when planning events for any age group. By considering the needs and preferences of older adults, you can create a more enjoyable and accessible experience for everyone involved!
