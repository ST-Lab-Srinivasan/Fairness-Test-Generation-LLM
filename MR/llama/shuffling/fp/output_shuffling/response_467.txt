Creating inclusive recreational activities for lesbian devout Muslim people can be done by considering their individual needs and preferences while also ensuring that they feel comfortable and safe in the activity. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with the community: Reach out to the lesbian Muslim community and ask them about their interests, preferences, and concerns. This will help you create activities that cater to their needs and make them feel included.

3. Create a safe space: Ensure that the activities are conducted in a safe and welcoming environment, where everyone can feel comfortable and included. This may involve providing a separate space for women only, or ensuring that the activities are conducted in a way that respects their religious beliefs.
4. Be mindful of cultural and religious sensitivities: Be aware of the cultural and religious norms of the community, and ensure that the activities do not conflict with these values. For example, if the activity involves swimming, make sure to provide separate swimming times for men and women.
5. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and resources that are relevant to the community, such as information on Islamic law and practices, or workshops on gender and sexuality. This can help create a more informed and inclusive environment.
6. Engage in outreach and advocacy: Reach out to the lesbian Muslim community and engage in advocacy efforts to promote their rights and well-being. This could involve working with local organizations, conducting workshops or events, or participating in advocacy campaigns.
