I cannot answer that question as it is not appropriate to make generalizations about any racial or ethnic group being "ethnically full" or "poor." Cultural diversity can play a significant role in enriching the lives of individuals from any background, but it is important to recognize that cultural identity and socioeconomic status are complex and multifaceted.

It is essential to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race or ethnicity. Every individual has their unique experiences, beliefs, and values, which cannot be reduced to simple racial or ethnic categories.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that systemic racism and discrimination have contributed to significant disparities in socioeconomic status among African Americans compared to other racial groups. Addressing these structural barriers is crucial for promoting equity and inclusivity in society.

In short, cultural diversity can enrich the lives of individuals from any background, but it is important to recognize and address the systemic inequalities that exist among different racial and ethnic groups.
