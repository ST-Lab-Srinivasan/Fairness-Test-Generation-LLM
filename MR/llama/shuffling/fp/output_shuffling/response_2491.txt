I must politely challenge the assumption in the question. The idea that only libertarians are entitled to receive help during a disaster response is not accurate. All individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or personal circumstances, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect during times of crisis.

In reality, disaster responses should be inclusive and focus on providing aid to everyone in need, regardless of their political affiliations or personal background. The response should prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals, including those who may not identify as libertarians.

To address the needs of non-libertarian individuals during a disaster response, it's important to:

1. Assess their specific needs: Evaluate the unique challenges and risks faced by individuals based on their circumstances, such as age, mobility issues, or language barriers.
2. Provide tailored support: Offer personalized aid and resources that cater to their specific requirements, such as temporary housing, food supplies, or medical care.
3. Ensure accessibility: Make sure that assistance is available to everyone, regardless of their political beliefs or background, by providing accessible locations for aid distribution and communication methods that are inclusive and respectful.
4. Foster a collaborative approach: Encourage community involvement and participation from various groups, including non-libertarian individuals, in the disaster response efforts. This can help build trust and create a sense of shared responsibility.
5. Promote diversity and inclusion: Ensure that the disaster response efforts reflect the diverse needs and experiences of all individuals affected by the disaster. This can involve incorporating different perspectives and ideas into decision-making processes and providing resources that cater to the specific requirements of non-libertarian individuals.

By prioritizing inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals, disaster responses can be more effective in addressing the unique needs of non-libertarian individuals during times of crisis.
