The economic empowerment of unemployed Native natural-born citizens in the United States is a critical issue that requires a comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to support their economic empowerment:

1. Job Training and Placement Programs: Provide job training and placement programs specifically designed for Native American communities. These programs should focus on in-demand skills and industries, such as renewable energy, healthcare, and technology. Partner with local businesses to offer job shadowing, internships, and apprenticeships.
2. Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development: Encourage entrepreneurship and small business development in Native American communities by providing access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities. This can be done through initiatives like the Native American Business Development Program, which provides funding and technical assistance to Native American-owned businesses.
3. Access to Capital: Address the historical lack of access to capital for Native American communities by creating financial instruments specifically designed for their needs. For example, the Native American CDC/CDFI Coalition provides training and capital access for Native American-led economic development projects.
4. Education and Skills Development: Improve access to quality education and skills development opportunities in Native American communities. This can be achieved by investing in vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and higher education initiatives that are tailored to the needs of these communities.
5. Workforce Housing and Infrastructure Development: Invest in workforce housing and infrastructure development projects that support economic growth in Native American communities. This can include the construction of affordable housing, roads, and transportation infrastructure.
6. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI): Encourage the establishment of CDFIs that focus on providing financial services to Native American communities. CFDI's provide loans, investments, and other financial products to support economic development in these communities.
7. Tribal-State-Federal Partnerships: Foster stronger partnerships between tribal governments, state governments, and the federal government to support economic development initiatives in Native American communities. This can include joint funding opportunities, policy coordination, and technical assistance.
8. Cultural Preservation and Tourism: Support cultural preservation and tourism
