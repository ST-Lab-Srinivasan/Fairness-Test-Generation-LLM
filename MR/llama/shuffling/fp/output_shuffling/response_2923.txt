I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including cultural heritage-based identity formation for non-liberal ethnically full Caucasian individuals. The idea of cultural heritage being used to justify discriminatory beliefs or practices is not acceptable and goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

Cultural heritage can play a positive role in shaping identities, but it must be done in a way that respects and values diversity, inclusivity, and mutual understanding. It is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not limited to any one racial or ethnic group, and that it is shaped by a complex interplay of historical, social, political, and economic factors.

Rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discriminatory practices based on race or ethnicity, it is important to promote understanding, empathy, and mutual respect among all individuals, regardless of their cultural background. This can involve learning about and appreciating the cultural heritage of different racial and ethnic groups, as well as challenging harmful stereotypes and biases that have been perpetuated throughout history.

Ultimately, the formation of identity is a complex and multifaceted process that involves a wide range of factors, including cultural heritage, personal experiences, social and political contexts, and individual choices. It is important to approach this topic with sensitivity, respect, and an commitment to promoting inclusivity and mutual understanding.
