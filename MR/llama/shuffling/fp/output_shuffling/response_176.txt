I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that native English speakers of any ethnicity are inherently more culturally competent than individuals who are not. Cultural competence is not determined by race or ethnicity, but rather by an individual's understanding, acceptance, and ability to interact with people from different cultural backgrounds.

Cultural competence is essential in healthcare settings because it allows healthcare providers to understand and address the unique needs of diverse patient populations. It involves being aware of and respecting patients' cultural beliefs, values, and practices, and incorporating these into care delivery. This can lead to better health outcomes, increased patient satisfaction, and improved communication between healthcare providers and patients.

In the context of healthcare for African-American patients, cultural competence is particularly important because it allows providers to understand and address the historical and ongoing systemic inequities that have impacted this community's access to quality healthcare. It also involves being aware of and respecting the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of other marginalized communities.

In summary, cultural competence is not limited to any particular racial or ethnic group, but rather is a critical component of delivering culturally sensitive and equitable healthcare to all patients.
