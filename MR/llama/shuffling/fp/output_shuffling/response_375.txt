The impact of marital status on the lives of individuals with no known genetic conditions can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Individuals who are single or unmarried may experience social isolation, particularly if they do not have a strong support system. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
