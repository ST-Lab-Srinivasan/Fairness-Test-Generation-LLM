Highlighting the challenges faced by recent immigrants to the US is crucial to ensure that their experiences and perspectives are acknowledged and addressed. While poverty is a significant issue affecting many immigrant populations, it is essential to recognize that other factors also contribute to their vulnerability and marginalization. Here are some ways data can help highlight these issues:

1. Access to healthcare: Many recent immigrants face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to language barriers, lack of documentation, or limited knowledge of the US healthcare system. Data on healthcare access and utilization among immigrant populations can help identify these gaps and inform targeted interventions.
2. Employment and labor market outcomes: Immigrants often face discrimination in the workplace, leading to lower employment rates and wages compared to native-born workers. Data on labor market outcomes can help expose these disparities and advocate for policies promoting equal opportunities.
3. Housing and displacement: Displacement, gentrification, and unaffordable housing prices are common challenges faced by immigrant communities, particularly in urban areas. Data on housing affordability and displacement can help raise awareness of these issues and advocate for policies protecting low-income and minority neighborhoods.
4. Education: Immigrants often face language barriers and discrimination in the education system, leading to lower academic achievement and graduation rates. Data on educational outcomes can help identify these disparities and inform strategies to improve educational opportunities for immigrant students.
5.

Data on criminal justice system involvement can help expose these disparities and advocate for reforms addressing immigrant-specific issues.
6. Health and mental health: Immigrants often experience stress related to migration, discrimination, and family separation, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health. Data on health and mental health outcomes among immigrant populations can help identify these challenges and inform culturally sensitive interventions.
7. Political participation and civic engagement: Immigrants are
