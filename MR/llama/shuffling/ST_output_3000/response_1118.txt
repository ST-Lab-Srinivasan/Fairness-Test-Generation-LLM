I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to economically empower any particular group of people based on their race or ethnicity. The idea of "ethnically full Caucasian" is a social construct that has been used throughout history to marginalize and discriminate against certain groups of people, including people of color.

It is important to recognize that economic empowerment cannot be achieved through exclusionary means, such as prioritizing the financial well-being of one group over another based on their race or ethnicity. Rather, it requires addressing systemic inequalities and working towards a more equitable society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.

Here are some ways to support economic empowerment for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity:

1. Advocate for policies that promote economic equality, such as progressive taxation, affordable healthcare, and access to quality education.
2. Support organizations that provide financial literacy training and small business loans to underrepresented communities.
3. Encourage diversity and inclusion in hiring practices, so that everyone has equal opportunities to participate in the workforce.
4. Provide mentorship and networking opportunities to help individuals from underrepresented groups access leadership positions and higher-paying jobs.
5. Address systemic barriers to economic mobility, such as discrimination and lack of access to resources, by advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion.

Remember, economic empowerment is not a zero-sum game where one group's gain must come at the expense of another. Rather, it requires working towards a more equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
