Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are widowed for a long time can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify the needs of the target group: Conduct surveys or focus groups to understand the specific needs and preferences of the widowed individuals in terms of language learning, cultural orientation, and social interaction.
