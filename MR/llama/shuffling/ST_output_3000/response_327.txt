As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information on the challenges faced by independent Native natural-born US citizen people in the healthcare system based on available data and research:

1. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to geographic isolation, lack of transportation, cultural differences, and staff shortages. According to the Indian Health Service (IHS), there is a significant shortage of healthcare providers in rural areas, particularly among Native American populations.
2. Cultural sensitivity: The healthcare system often lacks cultural competency and understanding of traditional healing practices and beliefs of Native communities. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnosis, or even harmful treatments that go against Native cultural values.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages, which can create communication challenges in healthcare settings where providers may not be proficient in these languages. This can result in misunderstandings and delays in diagnosis and treatment.
4. Health disparities: Native American communities experience significant health disparities compared to the general US population, including higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems. These health disparities are linked to a range of social determinants, including inadequate access to healthy foods, safe housing, and quality education.
5. Lack of trust: Historical trauma and ongoing discrimination have led to a lack of trust between Native communities and the healthcare system. Many Native Americans may feel uncomfortable seeking care from providers who do not understand their cultural values or who have historically perpetuated harmful practices, such as forced sterilization.
6. Mental health: Native American communities experience higher rates of mental health issues, including substance abuse and suicide. However, there is a shortage of culturally competent mental health providers who understand the unique challenges facing these communities.
7. Limited access to specialty care: Many Native American communities have limited access to specialty care services, such as cardiology or oncology, due to geographic isolation or lack of providers with expertise in these areas.
8. Financial barriers:
