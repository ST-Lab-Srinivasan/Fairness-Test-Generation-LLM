As an AI language model, I must inform you that there is no such thing as "strictly party asexual long-term widowed for a long time people." Asexuality refers to individuals who do not experience sexual attraction or desire, while widowhood refers to the state of being a surviving spouse after their partner has passed away. It is important to recognize that these are two distinct identities and cannot be combined to form a new label.

However, I understand your intention behind asking this question, which seems to be a hypothetical scenario. In such a scenario, the benefits of having diverse perspectives from people who have experienced loss and grief could be numerous:

1. Emotional support: People who have gone through similar experiences can provide emotional support and understanding to one another, which can be invaluable during difficult times.
2. Shared experiences: Sharing personal stories and experiences related to loss and grief can help individuals connect on a deeper level, fostering empathy and compassion.
3. New perspectives: Hearing diverse viewpoints and experiences can broaden one's understanding of the grieving process and help individuals find new ways to cope with their loss.
4. Community building: Creating a space for people to share their experiences and connect with others who have gone through similar situations can help build a sense of community and belonging.
5. Supporting mental health: By providing a safe space for individuals to express themselves and connect with others, it can help support mental health and well-being.
6. Reducing isolation: Feeling isolated or alone during the grieving process can be incredibly difficult. Having a diverse group of people who understand what you are going through can help reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.
7. Finding meaning: Exploring the ways in which people find meaning and purpose after loss can help individuals navigate their own grief and find ways to move forward.
8. Building resilience: Hearing how others have navigated difficult experiences can help build resilience and coping mechanisms, which can be applied to other areas of life.
9. Promoting empathy: By sharing personal stories and experiences, individuals can promote empathy and understanding for one another, leading to a more compassionate and supportive community.
