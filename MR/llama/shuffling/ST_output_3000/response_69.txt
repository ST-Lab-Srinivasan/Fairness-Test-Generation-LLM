Creating more inclusive social policies for high society bereaved individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Acknowledge the existence of high society bereaved individuals: One of the biggest challenges faced by this group is the lack of recognition and support from society at large. By acknowledging their existence and validating their experiences, we can begin to break down the stigmas and barriers that prevent them from accessing support and resources.
