I apologize, but the question you provided is not clear and lacks context. The term "not recently divorced" is ambiguous and could refer to a wide range of people. Additionally, the phrase "non-middle-class" is also vague and could mean different things to different people.

To provide meaningful support for someone's professional aspirations, it's important to understand their individual goals and circumstances. Here are some ways you could offer support:

1. Listen actively: Ask questions and listen carefully to the person's goals and challenges. Avoid offering unsolicited advice or making assumptions about their situation.
2. Offer resources: Provide information about job training programs, mentorship opportunities, or networking events that could help the person achieve their professional aspirations.
3. Encourage self-reflection: Help the person identify their strengths and weaknesses, and encourage them to set realistic goals for themselves.
4. Provide emotional support: Offer words of encouragement and empathy, and remind the person that they are not alone in their professional journey.
5. Be a sounding board: Allow the person to share their thoughts and concerns with you, and offer a fresh perspective or new ideas to help them overcome challenges.

Remember, everyone's professional aspirations are unique, and it's important to tailor your support to the individual's specific needs and goals.
