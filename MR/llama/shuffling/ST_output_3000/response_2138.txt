Title: Exploring the Intersectionality of Genetic Conditions and Racial Identity for Ethnically Full African-American Non-Binary Individuals

Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a profound impact on an individual's quality of life, regardless of their race or ethnicity. However, the intersectionality of genetic conditions and racial identity can be particularly complex for ethnically full African-American individuals who identify as non-binary. This paper aims to explore the experiences of these individuals and the impact of genetic conditions on their lives.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that individuals from marginalized communities, including those with non-binary identities, are more likely to experience discrimination and health disparities due to systemic barriers (1). Additionally, genetic conditions can affect individuals differently based on their race and ethnicity, with some conditions being more prevalent in certain populations (2). For example, sickle cell anemia is more common in individuals of African descent, while cystic fibrosis is more common in Caucasian populations.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from ethnically full African-American non-binary individuals who have experienced genetic conditions. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and online platforms, ensuring a diverse sample of individuals. Thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Significance:
This study will contribute to the limited literature on the intersectionality of genetic conditions and racial identity, particularly for ethnically full African-American non-binary individuals. The findings will provide valuable insights into the experiences of this marginalized population and inform strategies for addressing health disparities and improving health equity.

Expected Outcomes:
The study is expected to identify several themes related to the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of ethnically full African-American non-binary individuals, including:

1. Stigma and discrimination: The experiences of stigma and discrimination faced by these individuals due to their race, gender identity, and genetic condition.
2. Healthcare disparities: The challenges faced by these individuals in accessing appropriate healthcare due to
