Ensuring the healthcare needs of active-duty individuals aged over 90 years old (or over 85) can be challenging due to various factors such as limited medical resources, complex medical conditions, and the potential for cognitive decline. However, there are several steps that can be taken to address these challenges:

1. Early Detection and Intervention: Regular health check-ups and screenings can help identify any potential health issues early on, allowing for timely intervention and management. This is particularly important for older adults, as age-related diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's often present with subtle symptoms that may go unnoticed until they become more severe.
2. Multidisciplinary Care Teams: Assembling a team of healthcare professionals from various disciplines (e.g., geriatrics, neurology, psychiatry, physical therapy) can provide comprehensive care and support for older adults with complex medical needs. These teams can help coordinate care, address multiple health issues simultaneously, and provide ongoing monitoring and management.
3. Telemedicine and Remote Monitoring: With advances in telemedicine technology, it is now possible to remotely monitor older adults with chronic conditions, such as heart failure or diabetes, using wearable devices or mobile apps. This can help identify potential health issues earlier and provide more timely interventions.
4. Community-Based Services: Encouraging community-based services, such as home care, adult day care, and senior centers, can help older adults maintain their independence, socialize, and receive necessary support services while living at home. These services can also provide a safety net for individuals who may require more intensive care in the future.
5. Palliative Care: Offering palliative care options can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life for older adults with advanced illnesses. This type of care focuses on managing pain, breathlessness, and other symptoms, as well as providing emotional and spiritual support to the individual and their loved ones.
6. Caregiver Support: Recognizing the critical role that caregivers play in supporting older adults with complex health needs
