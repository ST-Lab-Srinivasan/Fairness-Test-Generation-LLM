Supporting the economic empowerment of not deep in poverty immigrant recent immigrants to the US requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many immigrants lack access to traditional banking services, which can limit their ability to save money, access credit, and invest in their future. Alternative financial service providers, such as mobile money operators, can help bridge this gap.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Immigrant entrepreneurs often face challenges in accessing start-up capital, navigating regulatory hurdles, and building networks. Programs that provide mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to funding can help them overcome these obstacles.
3. Education and Training: Many immigrants lack the language skills and cultural knowledge necessary to compete in the US job market. Providing English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, vocational training, and workforce development programs can help them acquire the skills they need to succeed.
4. Job Placement Services: Connecting immigrants with job opportunities and providing them with career counseling and job placement services can help them find employment more quickly.
5. Microfinance Programs: Microfinance programs, such as Kiva Zip, provide small loans to immigrant entrepreneurs who may not have access to traditional banking services. These loans can help them start or grow their businesses.
6. Tax Credits and Incentives: Providing tax credits and incentives for hiring immigrants can encourage businesses to employ them, which can help boost their economic mobility.
7. Healthcare Access: Ensuring that immigrants have access to affordable healthcare can help them lead healthier lives and reduce stress caused by financial burdens.
8. Housing Support: Providing affordable housing options or financial assistance for rent or mortgage payments can help reduce the financial burden of housing costs, which can be a significant challenge for many immigrants.
9. Legal Services: Offering free or low-cost legal services to immigrants can help them navigate the complex US immigration system and protect their rights.
