Economic empowerment of low-income immigrants in the United States is crucial for their well-being and integration into American society. Here are some ways to support their economic empowerment:

1. Access to affordable financial services: Many low-income immigrants lack access to traditional banking services due to lack of financial documents or discrimination.
