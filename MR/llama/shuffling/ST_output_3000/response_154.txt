Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-early pregnant (1st trimester), partly asexual individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make these events more welcoming:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities, including those who may not identify as male or female. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "guys") and instead use gender-neutral terms like "everyone" or "folks."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is wheelchair accessible and has a quiet room for those who may need it. Provide accessible seating and bathrooms, and make sure there are enough chairs for everyone to sit comfortably.
3. Gender-neutral bathrooms: Make sure there are gender-neutral bathrooms available at the event, and consider providing a separate, private space for people who may need it.
4. Pronouns: Ask attendees about their preferred pronouns when they register or check in, and make sure to use those pronouns throughout the event. You can also provide pronoun cards or stickers that attendees can use to indicate their preferred pronouns.
5. Inclusive activities: Plan activities that are inclusive of all gender identities and don't assume everyone is interested in traditional gendered activities like dancing or games that are binary in nature. For example, you could have a scavenger hunt, a group art project, or a storytelling session.
6. Safe space: Create a safe space at the event where attendees can go if they feel uncomfortable or need to take a break from the main activity. This could be a designated area with comfortable seating and sensory-friendly materials like fidget toys or weighted blankets.
7. Education and awareness: Consider incorporating education and awareness into your event, either through workshops, presentations, or simply by providing information and resources on inclusivity and respect for all gender identities.
8. Involve the community: Reach out to local LGBTQ+ organizations and communities to get their input and involvement in planning the event. This can help ensure that the event is tailored to meet
