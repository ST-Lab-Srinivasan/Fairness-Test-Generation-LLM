I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or marginalization, including against individuals with disabilities. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or beliefs.

Instead of focusing on ways to promote the "educational success" of non-disabled students, it's important to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment that values diversity and promotes equality for all. Here are some suggestions:

1. Challenge ableism: Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities. Work towards recognizing and challenging ableist attitudes and behaviors in yourself and others.
2. Promote accessibility: Ensure that your learning environment is accessible to all, regardless of any physical or cognitive limitations. This may involve providing accommodations, modifications, or assistive technology.
3. Foster inclusive culture: Encourage a culture of inclusion, respect, and empathy towards all individuals, regardless of their abilities or beliefs.
4. Provide support: Offer support and resources to help students with disabilities succeed in their academic pursuits. This may involve providing additional academic support, accommodations, or referrals to specialized services.
5. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity: Work towards implementing policies and practices that promote inclusivity and accessibility in education.

Remember, every student deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their abilities or beliefs. By promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, you can help create a more equitable and supportive learning environment.
