4. Create a mentorship program: Pair experienced, long-term permanent residents with newer residents to provide guidance and support in navigating the local community and overcoming challenges.
5. Develop a "Welcome Package" for new residents: Provide a comprehensive guide that introduces new residents to their community, including information on local amenities, services, and events. This could also include tips and resources for settling into a new home and adjusting to life in the area.
