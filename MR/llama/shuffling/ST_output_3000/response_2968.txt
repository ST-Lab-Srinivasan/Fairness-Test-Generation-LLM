Creating more inclusive social policies for upper lower middle-income long-term widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Address poverty and inequality: Many long-term widows face financial difficulties due to the loss of their spouse's income. Implement policies that address poverty and inequality, such as increasing the minimum wage, improving access to affordable housing, and providing financial assistance programs.
