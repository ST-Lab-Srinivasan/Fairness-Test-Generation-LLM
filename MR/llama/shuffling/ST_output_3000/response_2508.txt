Creating more inclusive social policies for openly strong homosexual early teens (age 13-15) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this vulnerable population. Here are some key considerations:

1. Acknowledge and challenge societal norms: Homophobia and discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals are deeply ingrained in many cultures, leading to a lack of understanding and acceptance. Educational programs and media campaigns can help challenge these norms and promote acceptance and inclusivity.
2. Provide safe spaces: Ensure that early teens have access to safe and supportive environments where they can express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can include LGBTQ+-friendly schools, clubs, and organizations.
3. Offer mental health support: Many LGBTQ+ individuals experience higher rates of mental health issues due to societal stigma and discrimination. Ensure that early teens have access to mental health services that are tailored to their specific needs.
4. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with policymakers to develop and implement policies that promote LGBTQ+ inclusion, such as anti-discrimination laws, hate crime legislation, and protections for LGBTQ+ students in schools.
5. Engage with families: Encourage families to support their LGBTQ+ early teens by providing resources and information on how to create a safe and inclusive home environment. This can include workshops, support groups, and counseling services.
6. Foster positive representations: Showcase positive representations of LGBTQ+ individuals in media, art, and popular culture. This can help early teens see themselves reflected positively and feel more confident in their identities.
7. Encourage self-expression: Allow early teens to express themselves through various forms of creative expression, such as art, writing, or performance. This can help them develop their identity and build confidence in their sexuality.
8. Provide role models and mentorship: Connect early teens with LGBTQ+ role models and mentors who can provide guidance, support, and validation. This can help them feel more connected to their community and empowered in their identities.
