Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals with genetic conditions who are not wealthy or multimillionaires requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that can help make these programs more accessible and inclusive:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the specific challenges that individuals with genetic conditions face, such as lack of access to healthcare, limited financial resources, or social isolation. Addressing these barriers can help create a more inclusive environment.
