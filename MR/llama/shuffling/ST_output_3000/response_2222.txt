The term "binary student" is not a commonly used or recognized term in education. It is possible that you may be referring to students who are in a non-traditional family structure, such as those with same-sex parents or blended families. If this is the case, here are some ways to promote the educational success of these students:

1. Create an inclusive and supportive learning environment: Ensure that all students feel welcome and supported in their academic pursuits. This can be done by providing a safe and inclusive classroom environment, offering support services such as counseling or tutoring, and promoting diversity and acceptance in the school community.
2. Provide flexible learning options: Offer flexible learning options to accommodate the unique needs of non-traditional families. For example, allow students to complete assignments or exams at different times or locations, as needed.
3. Address social and emotional needs: Non-traditional families may face additional challenges related to social and emotional well-being. Provide support services such as counseling or peer mentoring to help students navigate these challenges.
4. Foster positive relationships with teachers and peers: Encourage students to build positive relationships with their teachers and peers, which can help to enhance their academic experience.
5. Offer extracurricular activities and clubs: Provide opportunities for students to participate in extracurricular activities and clubs that align with their interests and passions. This can help to foster a sense of belonging and identity.
6. Address language barriers: If any students in the classroom speak different languages, ensure that appropriate accommodations are made to address language barriers.
7. Provide academic support: Offer academic support services such as tutoring or study groups to help students who may be struggling academically.
8. Encourage open communication: Encourage students and parents/guardians to communicate openly and honestly about any challenges they may be facing.
9. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage students to view challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than failures.
10. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of non-traditional families and promote inclusivity in all aspects of school life.
