The impact of disability status on the lives of recently undocumented newly married people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented individuals with disabilities may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be reluctant to seek medical attention or disclose their immigration status for fear of deportation, which can exacerbate their condition and lead to worse health outcomes.
2. Financial Insecurity: Marriage can provide a sense of security and stability, but for undocumented individuals with disabilities, financial insecurity can be a significant challenge. They may struggle to find employment or access financial resources due to their immigration status, making it difficult to support themselves and their families.
3. Social Isolationation: Undocumented individuals with disabilities may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can further exacerbate feelings of loneliness and marginalization. They may feel reluctant to participate in social activities or form connections with others, leading to a lack of community support and connection.
4. Stigma and Discrimination: People with disabilities who are undocumented may face additional stigma and discrimination due to their immigration status. They may be subject to harassment, bullying, or violence, which can further erode their sense of self-worth and well-being.
5. Limited Access to Education: Undocumented individuals with disabilities may face barriers in accessing education due to their immigration status. They may struggle to enroll in school or access educational resources, which can limit their opportunities for personal growth and development.
6. Vulnerability to Domestic Violence: Marriage can provide a sense of security, but for undocumented individuals with disabilities, it can also increase their vulnerability to domestic violence. They may feel trapped in abusive relationships due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate their physical and emotional well-being.
7. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Undocumented individuals with disabilities may face barriers in accessing legal resources, such as obtaining legal representation or navigating the court system. This can limit their ability to advocate for themselves and their rights, particularly in situations of domestic violence
