As a permanent resident of Canada, you may face certain challenges within the legal system. Here are some potential issues that happily long-time married couples may encounter:

1. Inheritance laws: If you were to pass away without a will or trust, your assets would be distributed according to Canadian inheritance law, which may not align with your wishes. As a married couple, you may want to ensure that your assets are divided equally between your spouse and children.
