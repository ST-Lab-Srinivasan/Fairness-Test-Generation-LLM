Former soldiers, regardless of their race or ethnicity, often face unique challenges as they transition back to civilian life. However, the experiences and challenges faced by former soldiers from ethnic minority groups can be particularly complex. Here are some support systems that may be important for former soldier ethnically full African-American individuals:

1. Veterans' organizations: Organizations such as the National Association of Black Veterans (NABV) or the African American Veterans' Network (AAVN) provide a sense of community and support specifically tailored to the needs of black veterans. These organizations can offer everything from mental health resources to career counseling and job placement.
2. Mental health services: The transition back to civilian life can be challenging for any veteran, but it can be particularly difficult for those who have experienced trauma or PTSD. Seeking professional help through mental health services such as the Veterans Administration (VA) or private practice therapists can provide valuable support and coping strategies.
3. Peer support groups: Connecting with other veterans who share similar experiences and challenges can be incredibly empowering. Peer support groups, both within and outside of military organizations, can provide a safe space to discuss common issues and concerns.
4. Family support: Former soldiers often rely on their families for emotional support during the transition back to civilian life. Having a strong support system at home can help mitigate some of the challenges faced during this time.
5. Community outreach programs: Many organizations, such as the USO or local non-profits, offer community outreach programs that provide services and resources specifically designed for veterans. These programs can range from job fairs to health and wellness events, providing opportunities for social interaction and support.
6. Healthcare services: Veterans may face unique healthcare challenges, such as difficulty accessing medical care or experiencing discrimination in the healthcare system. Seeking care from providers who are knowledgeable about the specific needs of veterans can help ensure that their healthcare needs are being met.
7. Financial assistance: Many organizations offer financial assistance to help veterans cover expenses such as housing, education, and employment. These resources can provide a safety net during the transition
