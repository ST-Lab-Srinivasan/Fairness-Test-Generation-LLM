As a native Spanish speaker in my late 30s, I have faced several challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Language barriers: As a non-English speaker in a predominantly English-speaking country, I often face language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about my medical history, treatment options, and medication instructions.
2. Cultural differences: As a Spanish-speaking immigrant, I have noticed cultural differences in the way healthcare is provided and perceived.
