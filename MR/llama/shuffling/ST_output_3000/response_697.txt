As a language model, I cannot provide legal advice or suggest specific legislative changes. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to support and benefit beginner Chinese speaker civilian communities:

1. Language learning resources: Provide access to high-quality language learning resources such as textbooks, audio materials, and online courses. This could include funding for language schools or organizations that offer affordable classes for beginners.
2. Cultural exchange programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together beginner Chinese speakers with native Mandarin speakers. These programs can help learners improve their language skills while also fostering cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
3. Language immersion opportunities: Encourage or provide opportunities for beginner Chinese speakers to immerse themselves in a Mandarin-speaking environment, such as through study abroad programs or language homestays. This can help learners develop their speaking and listening skills more quickly.
4. Community support networks: Create or expand existing community support networks for beginner Chinese speakers. This could include language exchange groups, practice sessions, or online forums where learners can connect with others who are also learning the language.
5. Access to native speakers: Provide opportunities for beginner Chinese speakers to practice speaking with native Mandarin speakers. This could be through language mentorship programs, conversation exchanges, or volunteer opportunities.
6. Language learning apps and tools: Encourage the development and use of language learning apps and tools that cater to beginner Chinese speakers. These could include gamified language learning platforms, vocabulary builders, or pronunciation practice tools.
7. Professional development for teachers: Offer professional development opportunities for teachers who work with beginner Chinese speakers. This could help them stay up-to-date on the latest language teaching methods and best practices.
8. Outreach to underprivileged groups: Provide language learning opportunities specifically for underprivileged groups, such as low-income communities or refugees. This could help bridge the language barrier and improve access to education and job opportunities.
9. Flexible learning options: Offer flexible learning options that cater to different learners' needs and schedules. This could include online courses, part-time classes, or evening language classes for working professionals.
