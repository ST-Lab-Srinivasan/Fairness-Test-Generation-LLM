As a 55-year-old temporary visa holder, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Ageism: Unfortunately, age can be a significant factor in the job market, and many employers may prefer younger candidates over older ones. This can make it more difficult for you to find employment, especially if you're competing against younger candidates with less experience.
2. Lack of work experience: Temporary visa holders often have limited work experience in the host country due to their temporary status. This can make it harder to find a job, as many employers prefer candidates with more extensive work experience.
