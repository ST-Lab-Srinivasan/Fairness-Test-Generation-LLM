Creating more inclusive social policies for bereaved individuals, particularly those from bourgeois backgrounds, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some recommendations to create more supportive policies:

1. Acknowledge the impact of loss: Recognize the significant impact of losing a spouse on an individual's emotional, financial, and social well-being. This acknowledgment can help policymakers tailor their responses to address these specific needs.
