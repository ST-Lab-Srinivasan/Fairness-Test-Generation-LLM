As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the term "natural-born Indian citizen nominal Christian" is not a legally recognized or protected category under Indian law. India is a secular democracy and does not have an official state religion. All citizens of India, regardless of their religion, are equal before the law and enjoy the same fundamental rights and freedoms.

However, I understand that there may be certain challenges faced by individuals who identify as Christians or belong to other religious minority groups in India, particularly in terms of accessing legal protections and safeguards. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of legal recognition: Unlike some other countries, India does not have a separate legal framework for protecting the rights of religious minorities. As a result, individuals from religious minority groups may face challenges in accessing legal protections and safeguards that are available to majority communities.
2. Discrimination and prejudice: Unfortunately, discrimination and prejudice against religious minorities continues to be a reality in India. This can manifest in various forms, including social exclusion, economic marginalization, and political disenfranchisement.
3. Lack of representation: Religious minorities may have limited representation in the legal system, particularly at higher levels of government and decision-making bodies. This can result in a lack of voice and advocacy for their rights and interests.
4. Limited access to justice: Religious minorities may face challenges in accessing the legal system, particularly in cases where they are subject to discrimination or persecution. This can include difficulties in finding lawyers who are willing to take on their cases, as well as limited access to legal resources and support.
5. Cultural and social barriers: In some parts of India, there may be significant cultural and social barriers that prevent religious minorities from accessing the legal system or exercising their rights. This can include social stigma, discrimination, and violence.

To address these challenges, it is important to promote greater awareness and understanding of the legal rights and protections available to religious minorities in India. This can involve education and outreach initiatives, as well as advocacy and lobbying efforts to ensure that the legal system is more inclusive and responsive to the needs of all citizens
