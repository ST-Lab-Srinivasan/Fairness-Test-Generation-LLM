Instead of focusing on specific religious groups, it's important to ensure that all students have access to an inclusive and well-rounded education that meets their individual needs and promotes mutual respect. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive curriculum: Develop a curriculum that includes diverse perspectives, cultures, and beliefs. Encourage critical thinking and open dialogue to foster empathy and understanding among students.
2. Accommodations: Provide reasonable accommodations for students who may have religious or cultural practices that differ from the majority. This could include flexible scheduling, prayer rooms, or modifications in assignments or assessments.
3. Safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment where all students feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage students to share their experiences and beliefs through storytelling, art, or other forms of expression.
4. Teacher training: Offer workshops or training sessions for teachers on how to address the diverse needs of their students, including cultural sensitivity and inclusive teaching practices.
5. Community engagement: Encourage collaboration between schools, community organizations, and interfaith groups to promote mutual understanding and respect among people of different backgrounds and beliefs.
6. Student leadership: Empower students from diverse backgrounds to take an active role in promoting inclusivity and cultural understanding within their school communities.
7. Curriculum development: Involve students, parents, and community members in the development of curricula that reflect the diversity of the student population and promote cross-cultural understanding.
8. School culture: Foster a school culture that values diversity, inclusivity, and respect for all beliefs and practices. Encourage students to share their experiences and perspectives through various forms of expression.
9. Professional development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities
