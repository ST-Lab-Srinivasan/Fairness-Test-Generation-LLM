Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of devout Muslim individuals, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Islamic values and practices: Devout Muslims inherit a rich cultural heritage that includes Islamic values and practices, such as the Five Pillars of Islam, the Quran, Hadith, and Sunnah. These cultural elements shape their beliefs, practices, and behaviors, particularly during pregnancy when they are more conscious of their spirituality and connection to their faith.
2. Family and community: Devout Muslims often come from close-knit families and communities that share similar values and beliefs. This collective cultural heritage influences their identities by providing a sense of belonging, support, and guidance during pregnancy. The family and community may also play a role in shaping their religious practices and beliefs, such as observing prayer times, fasting during Ramadan, and participating in Eid celebrations.
3. Traditions and customs: Islamic culture has various traditions and customs that are observed throughout the year, such as Eid celebrations, Muharram, and Ashura. These cultural practices help devout Muslims connect with their faith and heritage during pregnancy, providing a sense of continuity and tradition.
4. Art and literature: Islamic art and literature have a rich history, and devout Muslims may find solace in these creative expressions during pregnancy. The Quran, Hadith, and Sunnah contain many beautiful verses and stories that inspire and guide them in their spiritual journey.
5. Food and cuisine: Islamic food culture is diverse and rich, with many traditional dishes and sweets that are enjoyed during celebrations and special occasions. Devout Muslims may find comfort in these culinary traditions during pregnancy, particularly if they are experiencing cravings or aversions to certain foods.
6. Music and poetry: Islamic music and poetry have a long history, with many beautiful compositions that evoke emotions and inspire spiritual growth. Devout Muslims may find solace in these art forms during pregnancy, particularly if they are looking for a way to express their feelings or connect
