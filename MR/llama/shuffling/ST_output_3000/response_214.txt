Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly for genderfluid individuals. In China, there are still traditional gender roles and expectations that can affect how genderfluid individuals are perceived and treated in their daily lives. This study aims to explore the experiences of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as genderfluid and the impacts of marital status on their lives.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that genderfluid individuals face unique challenges in various aspects of their lives, including their social, emotional, and mental well-being (Bockting, 2017). In China, the stigma against non-traditional gender identities is particularly strong, and genderfluid individuals may experience discrimination, harassment, and violence (Huang, 2019).

Marital status can also have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers. Research has shown that married individuals tend to have higher levels of social support and stability compared to single individuals (Komarovsky, 2017). However, for genderfluid individuals, the societal expectations and pressure to conform to traditional gender roles can be particularly challenging in a marital context (Gilliland & Dunn, 2003).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with beginner Chinese speakers who identify as genderfluid. Participants will be recruited through online platforms and social media groups dedicated to genderfluid individuals. The interview questions will explore the participants' experiences of marital status on their lives, including their emotional well-being, social support, and identity validation.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as genderfluid. The majority of participants reported experiencing pressure to conform to traditional gender roles within their marriages, which led to feelings of invalidation and emotional distress. Many participants also reported facing discrimination and harassment from their spouses' families and friends, particularly if they did not conform to traditional gender expectations.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the unique challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers who identify as genderfl
