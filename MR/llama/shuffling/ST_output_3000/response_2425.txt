Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding between immigrant and recently immigrated strong heterosexual groups in the US. Cultural exchange refers to the sharing and exchange of cultural practices, values, beliefs, and traditions between different groups. In the context of immigration, cultural exchange can help bridge the gap between immigrant and host cultures, promoting mutual understanding and respect.
