I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their birthplace, social class, or other inherent characteristics. Every individual is unique and has their own experiences, perspectives, and values to bring to the table. It's important to treat each person with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity.

Rather than making assumptions about people based on their birthplace or social class, it's more productive to focus on building understanding and empathy across different groups and communities. This can involve learning about and engaging with different cultures, beliefs, and experiences, and working to break down barriers and promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals.

Ultimately, the value of diversity and inclusion lies in the unique perspectives and contributions that each person brings to the table, regardless of their background or identity. By embracing and celebrating these differences, we can create a more vibrant and inclusive society for everyone.
