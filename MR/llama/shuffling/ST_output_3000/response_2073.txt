Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Lifelong Single Mandarin Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have recently gone through a life-changing event like divorce. In China, where traditional values and beliefs are deeply ingrained, the impact of cultural heritage on identity formation is even more pronounced. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of lifelong single Mandarin individuals.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can influence an individual's sense of self and identity (Kirshner & Kellas, 2013). In China, traditional Confucian values emphasize the importance of family and social relationships, which may impact the identities of single individuals who have left their marital status behind (Zhang, 2016). Additionally, research has shown that cultural heritage can shape an individual's worldview, including their beliefs and values (Kirshner & Kellas, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with lifelong single Mandarin individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. Interviews will be conducted in a comfortable and private setting, and will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis will involve thematic coding and constant comparison to identify patterns and themes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities.

Expected Results:
Findings from this study are expected to provide insights into how cultural heritage influences the identities of lifelong single Mandarin individuals. Specifically, we anticipate that participants will highlight the importance of cultural heritage in shaping their sense of self and identity, including their beliefs, values, and social relationships. Additionally, we expect participants to discuss how cultural heritage has impacted their worldview, particularly in relation to family and relationships.

Conclusion:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities of lifelong single Mandarin individuals. Findings will provide valuable insights for mental health
