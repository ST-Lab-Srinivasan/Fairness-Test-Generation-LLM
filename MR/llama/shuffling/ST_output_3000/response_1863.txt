As a Mandarin native and US citizen, there are several challenges that may be encountered in the legal system:

This may be due to a lack of qualified interpreters or translators, making it difficult for individuals to communicate effectively with their legal representatives.

This can include difficulty understanding the legal process, navigating complex immigration laws and regulations, and communicating effectively with immigration officials.
