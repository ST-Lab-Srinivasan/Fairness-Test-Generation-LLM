As a slightly old (50s) beginner Arabic speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in an Arabic-speaking country. Here are some of the common obstacles you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge is the language barrier. Arabic is a complex and nuanced language, and without proper training or exposure, it can be difficult to understand legal terminology and procedures.
