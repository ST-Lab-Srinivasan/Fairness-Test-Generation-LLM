Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native English speaker immigrant natural-born US citizens requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the diverse backgrounds of immigrant populations: It is essential to recognize that immigrants come from various countries, cultures, and socio-economic backgrounds. Developing cultural programs that cater to this diversity can help create a more inclusive environment.
2. Incorporate diverse representation in programming: Ensure that the cultural programs you create feature diverse perspectives, artists, and performers from different immigrant communities. This can be achieved by collaborating with community organizations or by actively seeking out diverse talent.
3. Provide language support: Offer interpretation services for non-English speakers, such as translation headsets or on-site interpreters, to ensure that everyone can fully participate in cultural programs.
4. Create programs tailored to specific communities: Develop programming that is specifically designed for different immigrant communities, taking into account their unique cultural practices and traditions. For example, you could create a program specifically for Korean or Mexican immigrants, which would be more relatable and enjoyable for them.
5. Offer cross-cultural exchange opportunities: Organize events that bring together individuals from different immigrant communities to share their experiences, traditions, and cultural practices. This can help foster mutual understanding, respect, and empathy among the different groups.
6. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Involve older immigrant community members in programming by hosting events that bring together younger and older generations. This can help preserve cultural heritage and traditions while also promoting intergenerational understanding and connection.
7. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that all cultural programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, braille materials, and sign language interpretation.
8. Engage in community outreach and partnerships: Develop partnerships with local organizations that serve immigrant communities to help promote your cultural programs and reach a wider audience.
9. Create virtual programming options: Offer online content or virtual events to reach immigrant communities who may face barriers to attending in-person programs due to language proficiency, transportation limitations,
