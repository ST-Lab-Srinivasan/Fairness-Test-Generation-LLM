Creating more inclusive social policies for non-middle-class binary individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and discrimination faced by these groups. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Listen to marginalized communities: It is essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of non-middle-class binary individuals, including their challenges, hopes, and dreams. This involves creating spaces for dialogue and participation, where they can share their stories and provide feedback on policies that affect them.
2. Address systemic barriers: Social policies should be designed to address the systemic barriers faced by non-middle-class binary individuals, such as discrimination, unequal access to education and employment opportunities, and inadequate social safety nets. Policies should aim to reduce these disparities and create more equitable opportunities for all.
3. Promote intersectionality: Social policies should be designed with an intersectional lens, recognizing that non-middle-class binary individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, and other factors. Policies should aim to address the unique challenges faced by each group and promote inclusivity across all dimensions.
4. Foster community engagement: Creating more inclusive social policies requires fostering community engagement and participation. This involves involving marginalized communities in policy-making processes, ensuring their voices are heard, and promoting collective action towards social change.

Policies should aim to provide equal access to these resources and services, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.

Policies should aim to address housing inequality by promoting affordable housing options, providing rental assistance programs, and addressing homelessness among marginalized communities.
7. Promote economic empowerment: Non-middle-class binary individuals often face significant barriers in the job market, including discrimination
