Supporting the social inclusion of non-disabled casual Buddhists can be done through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Make sure that Buddhist centers, events, and activities are accessible to all, regardless of abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and assistive listening devices.
2. Offer diverse programs: Develop programs that cater to different needs and preferences, such as meditation classes for people with cognitive or intellectual disabilities, or yoga classes tailored to seniors' abilities.
3. Promote diversity in leadership: Ensure that the Buddhist community's leadership reflects the diversity of its members. This can be achieved by actively seeking out and promoting leaders from underrepresented groups.
4. Provide education and resources: Offer workshops, classes, or online resources on Buddhism and mindfulness practices that are tailored to different abilities and needs.
5. Encourage active listening: Train volunteers and leaders to actively listen to the needs and concerns of diverse members, and to be open to feedback and suggestions.
6. Foster intergenerational connections: Organize events or activities that bring together people of different ages and abilities, such as mentorship programs or community service projects.
7. Celebrate diversity: Host events that celebrate the diversity of the Buddhist community, such as cultural festivals or meditation retreats that incorporate different traditions and practices.
8. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with local governments and organizations to advocate for policies and practices that promote accessibility and inclusion in the broader community.
9. Create a buddy system: Pair new members with more experienced ones, or provide mentorship opportunities to help them feel more connected and included.
10. Provide accessible materials: Make sure that Buddhist texts, teachings, and resources are available in various formats, such as braille, large print, or audio versions, to cater to different learning needs.

By implementing these strategies, Buddhist communities can promote social inclusion and create a more diverse and welcoming environment for all members.
