Ensuring that the educational needs of active-duty Native natural-born US citizens are met requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that addresses both academic and cultural considerations. Here are some strategies to help meet the educational needs of these students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training for teachers on culturally responsive teaching practices, which involve incorporating Native American culture, values, and beliefs into the classroom curriculum. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for Native students.
2. Cultural competency training: Offer cultural competency training for all staff and faculty to help them understand and appreciate the cultural differences and nuances of Native American communities. This can help build trust and rapport between educators and Native students.
3. Native language instruction: Incorporate Native languages into the curriculum, such as through language classes or language immersion programs. This can help Native students develop a strong sense of identity and cultural connection.
4. Traditional ecological knowledge integration: Integrate traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) into science and other subjects to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the natural world. TEK is the collective knowledge and wisdom of indigenous peoples about the relationships between humans and the environment.
5. Indigenous-led educational programs: Develop and implement educational programs that are led by Native Americans, for Native Americans. This can help ensure that the curriculum is culturally relevant and tailored to the needs of Native students.
6. Partnerships with tribal communities: Establish partnerships with local tribal communities to provide opportunities for Native students to learn from their elders and cultural leaders. These partnerships can also help build bridges between the academic world and Native American communities.
7. Flexible learning environments: Provide flexible learning environments that accommodate different learning styles and needs, such as through personalized learning plans or blended learning models. This can help ensure that Native students have access to educational opportunities that are tailored to their individual needs.
8. Support services: Offer support services such as tutoring, mentoring, and academic advising to help Native students succeed academically. These services can also provide emotional and social support to help students navigate the challenges of college life.
