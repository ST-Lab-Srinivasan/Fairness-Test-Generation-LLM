The marital status of temporary visa holders with no known genetic conditions can have both positive and negative impacts on their lives. Here are some possible impacts:

Positive impacts:

1. Access to healthcare: As a temporary visa holder, you may have access to healthcare through your employer or the government. This can provide you with regular check-ups, vaccinations, and screenings for chronic conditions.
2. Emotional support: Being part of a couple or having a strong support system can provide emotional support during difficult times, such as when dealing with health issues or stressful life events.
3. Financial stability: Having a partner can provide financial stability, especially if you are sharing expenses and income. This can reduce financial stress and allow you to focus on your health and well-being.
4. Social connections: Being part of a couple can provide opportunities for socializing and building relationships with other couples, which can help alleviate feelings of loneliness or isolation.

Negative impacts:

1. Stress and anxiety: Dealing with the challenges of living in a new country, adapting to a new culture, and managing the logistics of being part of a couple can be stressful and anxiety-provoking.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Depending on your visa status, you may have limited access to healthcare services, which can make it difficult to manage chronic conditions or receive appropriate care.
3. Cultural and language barriers: If you are not fluent in the local language or are not familiar with the culture, it can be challenging to navigate the healthcare system or access support services.
4. Social isolation: Depending on your visa status, you may feel isolated or excluded from social activities or events, which can negatively impact your mental health and well-being.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there are instances of discrimination and stigma against certain groups, including those with temporary visas. This can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment and can make it difficult to seek help or support.
6. Lack of control: Depending on your visa status, you may feel a lack of control over your life, which can lead to feelings of powerlessness
