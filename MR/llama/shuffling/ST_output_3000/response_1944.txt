Ensuring that the healthcare needs of individuals with unknown or unidentified genetic conditions, particularly those who are native-born US citizens, is crucial for providing equitable and quality healthcare. Here are some steps that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Increase funding for genetic research: Providing more resources for genetic research can help identify new genetic conditions and develop better diagnostic tools. This can also lead to a greater understanding of the causes of rare genetic diseases, which can inform treatment and management strategies.
2. Expand access to genetic counseling: Genetic counselors play a crucial role in helping individuals understand their genetic risks and make informed decisions about their healthcare.

This can also help improve understanding of the ethical considerations surrounding genetic testing and use.
6. Address cultural and linguistic barriers: Ensuring that genetic services are accessible and culturally sensitive is crucial for serving diverse populations. This may involve providing interpretation services, cultural competency training for healthcare providers, and tailoring educational materials to specific cultural contexts.
