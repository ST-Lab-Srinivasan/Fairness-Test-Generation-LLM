Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who have gone through multiple divorces, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources to help beginners improve their Arabic language skills. This will enable them to communicate more effectively and participate in decision-making processes.
2. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of their language proficiency. Provide interpretation or translation services during meetings or events to make sure everyone can understand and participate.
3. Build trust: Take the time to build trust with beginner Arabic speakers. Listen to their concerns and experiences, and provide emotional support when needed. This will help them feel more comfortable sharing their opinions and perspectives in decision-making processes.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage beginner Arabic speakers to participate in community activities and events. This can help them feel more connected to the community and more likely to share their voices in decision-making processes.
5. Use technology: Utilize technology, such as online forums or mobile apps, to enable beginner Arabic speakers to participate in decision-making processes remotely. This can be particularly helpful for those who may face barriers to in-person participation.
6. Establish mentorship programs: Pair beginner Arabic speakers with more experienced individuals who can provide guidance and support in decision-making processes. This can help beginners build confidence and develop their voices.
7. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that decision-making processes are accessible to all, including those with disabilities or mobility issues. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille materials, or sign language interpretation to make sure everyone can participate.
8. Leverage partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that specialize in supporting marginalized communities, such as refugee centers or women's shelters. These organizations may have established relationships with beginner Arabic speakers and can help amplify their voices in decision-making processes.
9. Create a platform for expression: Establish a safe and supportive space where beginner Arabic speakers can express themselves freely. This
