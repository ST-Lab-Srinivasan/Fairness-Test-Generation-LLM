Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class natural-born US citizen people are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various social and economic factors affecting their access to quality healthcare. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Improve access to affordable health insurance: Expanding Medicaid eligibility, creating a public option, or implementing a single-payer system can increase access to affordable health insurance for lower-class individuals. This can help reduce financial barriers to healthcare and ensure that people receive the necessary medical care.
2. Increase funding for community health clinics: Community health clinics provide essential primary care services to underserved populations, including low-income individuals. Increasing funding for these clinics can help expand their capacity and reach more people in need of healthcare.
