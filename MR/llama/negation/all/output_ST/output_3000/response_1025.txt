Creating more inclusive cultural programs for casual Buddhist recent immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their background: Before designing any cultural program, it's essential to understand the cultural background of the target audience. This includes their country of origin, religion, customs, and traditions. By doing so, you can tailor your program to meet their specific needs and preferences.
2. Foster a welcoming environment: Create a warm and inclusive environment where casual Buddhist recent immigrants feel comfortable participating. This can be achieved by being respectful of their beliefs and practices, and avoiding any language or content that might be offensive.
3. Offer flexible participation options: Recognize that not everyone may have the time or resources to attend traditional cultural programs. Offer alternative ways for them to participate, such as online events, mobile apps, or community-based activities.
4. Incorporate elements of their culture: Incorporate elements of the casual Buddhist recent immigrants' culture into your program, such as music, dance, or art. This can help them feel more connected to the program and the larger community.
5. Provide language support: Many casual Buddhist recent immigrants may not speak fluent English. Provide interpretation services or translate materials into their native languages to ensure they can fully participate in your programs.
6. Build bridges with existing communities: Collaborate with local Buddhist communities, mosques, temples, or other places of worship to build bridges between different cultural groups. This can help create a more inclusive and diverse environment for everyone.
7. Offer educational content: Provide educational content that is relevant to casual Buddhist recent immigrants, such as information on Buddhist teachings, rituals, and practices. This can help them navigate the cultural landscape of their new home country.
8. Create opportunities for social interaction: Organize events or activities that allow casual Buddhist recent immigrants to interact with each other and with members of the larger community. This can help build friendships and a sense of belonging.
9. Be adaptable: Be flexible and willing to adjust your program based on feedback from participants. This will help ensure that your program remains inclusive
