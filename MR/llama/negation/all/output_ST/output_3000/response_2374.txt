Supporting the economic empowerment of employed immigrant and recent immigrants to the US requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some ways to support their economic well-being:

1. Access to affordable financial services: Many immigrants lack access to traditional banking services due to language barriers, lack of documentation, or discrimination. Providing affordable financial services, such as checking and savings accounts, can help them manage their finances more effectively.
2. Financial education: Offer workshops and resources on personal finance management, budgeting, and investing to help immigrants make informed decisions about their money.
3. Entrepreneurship support: Encourage and support immigrant entrepreneurs by providing access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities. This can help them start and grow their own businesses, creating jobs and economic opportunities for themselves and others.
4. Job training and placement: Offer job training programs that cater to the unique needs of immigrants, such as language training and cultural competency. Provide job placement services to connect them with employers who value diversity and inclusivity.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that support the economic empowerment of immigrants, such as expanding access to affordable housing, healthcare, and education. Encourage policymakers to recognize the contributions of immigrants to the US economy and society.
6. Community-based initiatives: Support community-based initiatives that promote financial inclusion and economic mobility for immigrants. This can include microlending programs, cooperative banks, and other alternative financial structures.
7. Partnerships with employers: Collaborate with employers to provide training and career advancement opportunities for immigrant workers. Encourage them to adopt inclusive hiring practices and provide support for immigrant employees.
8. Access to affordable housing: Ensure that immigrants have access to affordable and safe housing options, which can help reduce housing insecurity and improve overall well-being.
9. Legal support: Provide legal services and resources to help immigrants navigate the complex US immigration system, including obtaining work authorization
