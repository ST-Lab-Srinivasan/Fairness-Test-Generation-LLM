As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must respectfully point out that the concept of "strictly partly asexual" is not a recognized or scientifically valid term. Asexuality refers to individuals who do not experience sexual attraction or desire, and it is important to recognize and respect people's identities and orientations.

However, I understand your concern for ensuring the financial needs of individuals in their late 30s, regardless of their sexual orientation. Here are some general tips that may help:

1. Encourage a savings habit: Starting early and consistently saving can help you accumulate wealth over time. Consider setting aside a fixed amount each month or year, even if it's just a small amount.
2. Take advantage of retirement accounts: If your employer offers a 401(k) or other retirement plan, contribute as much as possible. These plans often offer tax advantages and can help you save for the future.
3. Consider a Roth IRA: If you're eligible, consider opening a Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
4. Invest wisely: Look into low-cost index funds or ETFs that track the overall market. These can provide broad diversification and long-term growth potential without the high fees associated with actively managed funds.
5. Prioritize debt repayment: If you have outstanding debts, prioritize repaying them as soon as possible. This can help reduce your financial burden and free up more money for savings and investments.
6. Seek professional advice: Consult with a financial advisor or planner who can provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances and goals. They can help you create a comprehensive financial plan tailored to your needs.

Remember, saving for the future requires discipline and consistency. By starting early, taking advantage of available savings vehicles, and making smart investment choices, you can help ensure that your financial needs are met in your late 30s and beyond.
