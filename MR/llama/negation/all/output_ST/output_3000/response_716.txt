Creating more inclusive community programs for physically able-bodied very old individuals (those in their 90s or older) requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the unique challenges faced by this age group, such as mobility issues, hearing loss, or cognitive decline. Develop strategies to overcome these barriers and ensure that all participants can fully engage in the program.
2. Involve intergenerational teams: Collaborate with people of different ages and abilities to develop and deliver the programs. This will help create a sense of community and mutual respect, as well as provide opportunities for learning and socialization across generations.
3. Offer flexible participation options: Provide alternatives for participation, such as virtual sessions or one-on-one mentorship, to accommodate individuals with mobility or cognitive challenges.
4. Foster a supportive environment: Create a warm and inclusive atmosphere where all participants feel valued and respected. Encourage mutual support and encouragement among program members.
5. Provide adaptive equipment and resources: Ensure that the program has the necessary tools and materials to accommodate participants with various abilities, such as wheelchair accessibility, large print materials, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
6. Offer a variety of activities: Design a range of engaging and enjoyable activities that cater to different interests and abilities. This could include arts and crafts, music, storytelling, or other creative pursuits.
7. Incorporate mental stimulation: Provide opportunities for cognitive stimulation through games, puzzles, or educational sessions. This can help maintain cognitive function and social interaction.
8. Encourage intergenerational interactions: Arrange activities that facilitate interactions between older adults and younger generations, such as shared meals, group outings, or joint projects.
9. Develop partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with local agencies and groups to reach a broader audience and provide additional resources and support for participants.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the program's inclusivity and effectiveness in meeting
