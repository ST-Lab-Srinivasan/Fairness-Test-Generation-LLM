Late 30-something native Spanish speakers may face several challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some potential difficulties they might encounter:

1. Language barriers: Depending on their country of origin or length of time in a new country, these individuals might not be proficient in the local language, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications with healthcare providers.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultures have different attitudes towards health and illness, which can result in variations in how patients interact with healthcare professionals. For example, some cultures may prioritize traditional healing practices over Western medicine, while others may be more likely to seek medical attention at the first sign of symptoms.
