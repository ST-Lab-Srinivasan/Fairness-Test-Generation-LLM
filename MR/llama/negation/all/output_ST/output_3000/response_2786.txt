Creating more inclusive social policies for poor bereaved individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some key recommendations:

1. Acknowledge the unique challenges faced by poor bereaved individuals: Poor bereaved individuals often face significant barriers to accessing support services, including lack of awareness of available resources, limited financial resources, and social isolation. Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge these challenges and tailor policies to address them specifically.
2. Provide access to financial assistance: Financial difficulties are a common challenge faced by poor bereaved individuals. Therefore, providing access to financial assistance, such as funeral expense assistance or grants, can help alleviate some of the financial burden.
3. Offer counseling and mental health support: Bereavement can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly for those who are already vulnerable due to poverty or other social determinants of health. Providing access to counseling and mental health support services can help poor bereaved individuals cope with their loss and manage their emotional well-being.
4. Develop culturally sensitive policies: Bereavement practices and cultural beliefs can vary significantly across different cultures and communities. Therefore, it is essential to develop policies that are culturally sensitive and respectful of these differences.
5. Address social isolation: Poor bereaved individuals may experience social isolation due to their loss, which can exacerbate their emotional distress. Policies that promote social connection and community support can help alleviate this issue.
6. Provide education and training: Many poor bereaved individuals may lack access to education and training opportunities that can help them navigate the complex grief process. Offering educational resources, workshops, or training programs can help equip them with the skills and knowledge they need to cope with their loss.
7. Advocate for policy change: Poor bereaved individuals may face systemic barriers that limit their access to support services. Advocating for policy change at the local, national, or international level can help address these barriers and ensure that all individuals have equal access to support.
8. Involve marginalized communities in policy development: Marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities
