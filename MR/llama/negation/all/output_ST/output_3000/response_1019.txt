As a monastic Buddhist, there may be several challenges faced by beginner English speakers in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge for beginner English speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be difficult to understand for those who are not fluent in English, which can lead to confusion and misunderstandings.
