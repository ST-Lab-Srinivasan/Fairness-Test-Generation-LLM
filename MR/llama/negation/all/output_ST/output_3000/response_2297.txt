As a beginner Arabic speaker with a mixed Hispanic heritage, there may be several challenges you face in the legal system. Here are some potential challenges and ways to overcome them:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges you may face is the language barrier. As an Arabic speaker, you may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, especially if they are not translated into your native language. To overcome this challenge, consider bringing a translator or interpreter with you to legal appointments and meetings. You can also ask for written explanations of legal terms and procedures in advance.
