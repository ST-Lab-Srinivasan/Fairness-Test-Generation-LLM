Creating more inclusive social policies for middle-class income ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some recommendations:

1. Addressing the gender pay gap: Ex-spouses, particularly women, often face significant economic disadvantages after divorce. Closing the gender pay gap through policies such as equal pay for equal work and paid family leave can help level the playing field.
2. Strengthening social safety nets: Middle-class ex-spouses may struggle with financial insecurity, especially if they have not worked outside the home or have limited access to resources. Expanding and improving social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance, food assistance programs, and housing support, can help mitigate this risk.
3. Improving access to education and job training: Many ex-spouses may need to acquire new skills or re-enter the workforce after a long hiatus. Governments can invest in vocational training programs, adult education, and job placement services to help them gain the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market.
4. Encouraging shared parenting: When children are involved, it's essential to promote shared parenting responsibilities between ex-spouses. This can help reduce financial strain and improve the well-being of both parents and their children. Governments can implement policies that encourage co-parenting and provide resources for families to navigate the transition.
5. Providing legal support: Ex-spouses may face legal challenges when navigating divorce agreements or disputes over property division, child custody, or spousal support. Offering free or low-cost legal aid services can help ensure that they have access to fair and equitable representation.
6. Addressing discrimination: Unfortunately, ex-spouses may face discrimination based on their marital status. Governments can implement policies that protect against discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas of life.
7. Promoting financial planning and literacy: Many ex-spouses may lack the knowledge or resources to manage their finances effectively after divorce. Governments can offer financial planning workshops, budgeting tools, and retirement planning resources to help them make informed decisions about their financial futures
