Addressing the specific needs of mixed Asian heritage students who are no longer newly married in education requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account their unique experiences and challenges. Here are some strategies that educators and administrators can use to support these students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Mixed Asian heritage students may face cultural identity conflicts as they navigate multiple cultures and identities. Educators can incorporate culturally responsive teaching practices, such as using diverse teaching materials, incorporating student interests and experiences, and creating inclusive classroom environments.
2. Diversity and inclusion initiatives: Implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives can help create a welcoming and supportive school environment for mixed Asian heritage students. This can include hosting cultural events, providing training on diversity and inclusion, and establishing student clubs or organizations that promote cultural exchange and understanding.
3. Identity-safe spaces: Creating identity-safe spaces where mixed Asian heritage students can share their experiences and connect with peers can help them feel seen and heard. This can involve establishing peer support groups, hosting discussions on cultural identity, and providing opportunities for students to share their stories and perspectives.
4. Intersectionality framework: Using an intersectionality framework can help educators understand the unique experiences of mixed Asian heritage students who are no longer newly married. This involves considering how factors such as race, gender, sexuality, class, and immigration status intersect and impact a student's identity and well-being.
5. Critical pedagogy: Implementing critical pedagogy can help educators challenge dominant narratives and structures that perpetuate inequality and discrimination. This involves encouraging students to question and critique systems of power, explore alternative perspectives, and develop critical thinking skills.
6. Community partnerships: Building partnerships with community organizations that serve mixed Asian heritage populations can provide valuable resources and support for educators. This can involve collaborating on programming, sharing best practices, and providing opportunities for students to engage in community service and advocacy.
7. Professional development: Providing professional development opportunities for educators can help them better understand the needs of mixed Asian heritage students who are no longer newly married. This can involve attending workshops on culturally responsive teaching, participating in training sessions on diversity
