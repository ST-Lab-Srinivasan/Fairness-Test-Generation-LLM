Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for partially identifying as non-binary and partly asexual individuals requires understanding, acceptance, and active steps towards inclusion. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about non-binary and asexual identities, the challenges they face, and the importance of inclusivity. This will help you understand their needs and create celebrations that are welcoming and respectful.
2. Involve non-binary and asexual individuals in planning: Consult with people who identify as non-binary and asexual to get their input on how to make your cultural celebrations more inclusive. This will help ensure that the celebrations are tailored to meet their needs and feel comfortable for them.
3. Use gender-neutral language: Avoid using binary gender language (i.e., "guys," "girls," etc.) in your celebration materials and instead use gender-neutral terms like "everyone," "all," or "community."
4. Incorporate non-binary and asexual identities into cultural traditions: Find ways to include non-binary and asexual individuals in cultural traditions, such as incorporating gender-neutral costumes or decorations.
5. Create safe spaces: Provide separate spaces for non-binary and asexual individuals who may feel uncomfortable participating in activities with binary gender groups. This can help them feel more included and comfortable during the celebration.
6. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide options for non-binary and asexual individuals to identify their gender identity or pronouns, such as "non-binary" or "they/them."
7. Be mindful of ableism: Be aware of ableist language or behaviors that may be present in cultural celebrations and take steps to avoid them. For example, avoid using language that assumes everyone is cisgender (i.e., not transgender) or able-bodied.
8. Celebrate non-binary and asexual identities: Incorporate elements into your cultural celebrations that specifically recognize and honor non-binary and asexual identities, such as creating a space for them to share their experiences or honoring their contributions to the community.
9. Be flexible: Be willing
