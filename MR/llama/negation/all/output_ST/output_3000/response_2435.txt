Protecting the legal rights of active-duty mentally disabled individuals is crucial to ensure they receive the support and accommodations they need to serve in the military. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Section 504 Accommodation: The Department of Defense (DoD) is required by law to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This includes providing adaptive equipment, modifying duties or work environments, and offering support services such as counseling or job coaching.
2. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodations, and other areas. Active-duty military personnel are entitled to the same protections under the ADA as civilians.
3. Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA): USERRA protects the civilian employment and reemployment rights of members of the uniformed services, including those with mental health conditions. This includes providing job protection and requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations for service members upon return from deployment.
4. Mental Health Services Act: The MHSA provides funding for mental health services in California, including outpatient treatment, case management, and peer support services. Active-duty military personnel stationed in California may be eligible for these services.
5. Military OneSource (MOS): MOS is a comprehensive support program that provides military members and their families with information, resources, and services on a variety of topics, including mental health. This includes access to mental health professionals, counseling, and other support services.
6. Military Family Research Institute (MFRI): MFRI is a research organization within the U.S. Army that conducts studies on military families, including those with mental health conditions. The institute provides information and resources for active-duty military personnel and their families.
7. National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI): NAMI is a national organization that provides education, support, and advocacy for individuals and families affected by mental illness. Active-duty military personnel may find local NAMI chapters and resources
