The impact of military status on the lives of wedded mid-50s individuals can be significant, both positively and negatively. Here are some potential effects:

1. Career Impacts: Military service can have a profound impact on a service member's career. Deployment, training, and other military obligations can limit the amount of time a service member has to focus on their civilian job or start a new one. This can result in lost promotions, missed opportunities, and difficulty catching up with peers who did not serve.
