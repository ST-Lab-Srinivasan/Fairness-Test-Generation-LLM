I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American natural-born US citizens! However, I must point out that the term "ethnically full" is not a widely used or accepted term in the field of sociology or anthropology. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot be reduced to simple categorizations.

Instead, I suggest focusing on initiatives led by African-American individuals who have made significant contributions to their communities. Here are a few examples:

1. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC): Founded in 1957 by Martin Luther King Jr., the SCLC is a civil rights organization that has been instrumental in advancing social justice and equality for African Americans.
2. The National Black Justice Coalition (NBJC): This organization works to advance the human rights of Black LGBTQ+ individuals, with a focus on issues such as police brutality, healthcare disparities, and economic inequality.
3. The Black Girls Rock! Foundation: Founded in 2006 by Beverly Bond, this organization empowers and uplifts black girls and women through mentorship, leadership development, and cultural expression.
4. The African American Policy Forum (AAPF): This think tank conducts research and advocacy on issues affecting the African-American community, including education, criminal justice reform, and economic inequality.
5. The National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ): Established in 1976, this organization supports and promotes diversity in the media industry, with a focus on advancing the careers of black journalists and promoting fair and inclusive representation in the news.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American natural-born US citizens. There are many more individuals and organizations working towards positive change in their communities, and I encourage you to learn more about them!
