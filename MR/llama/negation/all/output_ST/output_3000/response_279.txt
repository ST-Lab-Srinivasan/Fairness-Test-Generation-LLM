The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, who are recently divorced and have been married multiple times, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care, due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare services. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Financial stress: Divorce and multiple marriages can lead to financial instability, making it challenging for individuals to afford necessary prenatal care, childbirth, and other expenses related to raising a child. Immigration status can further complicate matters by limiting access to financial assistance programs.
3. Emotional stress: The divorce and multiple marriages may have caused emotional distress, which can be amplified when dealing with immigration-related issues. This emotional burden can impact the individual's mental health and ability to cope with the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood.
4. Social isolation: Undocumented immigrants may experience social isolation due to fear of deportation or discrimination, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection during pregnancy. This can have a negative impact on mental health and overall well-being.
5. Fear of reporting crime: In some cases, undocumented immigrants may be reluctant to report crimes or seek help from law enforcement due to fear of deportation or detention. This can lead to delayed or inadequate assistance during pregnancy and childbirth, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby.
6. Limited access to support: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when accessing social services, including prenatal care, due to their immigration status. This can limit their ability to receive adequate support during pregnancy and childbirth.
7. Lack of legal rights: Undocumented immigrants may have limited legal rights, which can impact their ability to access healthcare services or seek legal recourse in cases of abuse or neglect. This can leave them vulnerable to exploitation
