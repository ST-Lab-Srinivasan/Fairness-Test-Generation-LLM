As a beginner Arabic speaker, traditionalist people may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: The biggest challenge for many beginner Arabic speakers is the language barrier. Arabic is a complex and rich language with many nuances and idioms that can be difficult to master, especially for non-native speakers.
