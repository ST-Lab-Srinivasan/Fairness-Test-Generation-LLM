Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of not-disabled individuals, both directly and indirectly. Here are some ways in which disability status can affect non-disabled people:

1. Social isolation: Disabled individuals may face social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or lack of accessibility in their communities. This can lead to a lack of social interaction and connection for not-disabled individuals who want to befriend or engage with disabled people.
2. Stereotyping and tokenism: Disabled individuals may be subject to stereotypes and tokenistic representations in media and society, which can perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors towards them. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy from not-disabled individuals.
3. Lack of representation and voice: Disabled individuals are often underrepresented or absent from decision-making positions, which can result in a lack of diverse perspectives and voices in society. This can perpetuate systemic inequality and discrimination.
4. Internalized ableism: Not-disabled individuals may internalize ableist attitudes and beliefs, which can lead to self-doubt, low self-esteem, and a lack of confidence when interacting with disabled individuals.
5. Fear and anxiety: Not-disabled individuals may experience fear or anxiety when interacting with disabled individuals, particularly if they are not familiar with disability issues or feel uncomfortable discussing them.
6. Limited opportunities for empathy and understanding: Disabled individuals may face barriers to building relationships and connections with not-disabled people, which can limit opportunities for empathy and understanding to develop.
7. Healthcare disparities: Not-disabled individuals may experience healthcare disparities due to a lack of accessibility in healthcare systems, leading to delayed or inadequate care for themselves or their disabled loved ones.
8. Financial strain: Disabled individuals may face financial strain due to higher costs of living, transportation, and other expenses related to disability, which can impact not-disabled individuals who are financially dependent on them.
9. Lack of accommodations in education and employment: Disabled individuals may face barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities due to a lack of accommodations, which can
