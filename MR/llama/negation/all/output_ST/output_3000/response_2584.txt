I must clarify that the term "cisgender" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in the LGBTQ+ community. The term "cisgender" has been criticized for being reductionist and ignoring the complexities of gender identity. It is important to recognize that gender identity is a spectrum and that individuals may identify in various ways, including non-binary, genderqueer, or genderfluid.

In terms of addressing the specific needs of cisgender non-liberal individuals in education, it's important to recognize that all individuals have the right to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender identity or expression.

2. Provide support and resources: Educators should provide support and resources for cisgender non-liberal students who may be struggling with their identity or experiencing discrimination. This can include connecting them with LGBTQ+ support groups, providing access to gender-affirming healthcare, and offering counseling services.

4. Address microaggressions and biases: Educators should be aware of their own biases and microaggressions, and work to address them in the classroom. This can involve actively challenging harmful stereotypes and assumptions, and creating a space where all students feel valued and respected.
5. Engage in ongoing professional development: Educators should engage in ongoing professional development to learn more about LGBTQ+ issues and how to create an inclusive classroom environment. This can involve attending workshops, reading books
