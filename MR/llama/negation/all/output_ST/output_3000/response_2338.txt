Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of Native American natural-born US citizens who are from lower middle-income backgrounds. Here are some ways cultural diversity can positively impact their lives:

1. Preservation of Traditions and Culture: Cultural diversity allows Native Americans to preserve their traditional practices, beliefs, and customs, which are an essential part of their identity. These traditions provide a sense of belonging, connection to their heritage, and pride in their cultural legacy.
2. Access to Multiple Perspectives: Exposure to diverse cultures broadens one's perspective on life, fostering empathy, understanding, and tolerance. This can help lower-middle-income Native Americans navigate complex social issues and make informed decisions that benefit their communities.
3. Enhanced Civic Engagement: Cultural diversity promotes civic engagement by encouraging participation in community events, volunteering, and advocacy for marginalized groups. This can help lower-middle-income Native Americans develop leadership skills, build relationships with diverse stakeholders, and create positive change in their communities.
4. Economic Opportunities: Cultural diversity can provide economic opportunities by creating a more vibrant and dynamic local economy. By promoting cultural exchange and tourism, lower-middle-income Native Americans can benefit from increased foot traffic, job creation, and entrepreneurial ventures.
5. Improved Mental Health: Cultural diversity has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Exposure to diverse cultures can provide a sense of emotional security, improve coping mechanisms, and enhance overall well-being.
6. Strengthened Community Bonds: Cultural diversity fosters a sense of community by bringing people together around shared values, traditions, and practices. This can help lower-middle-income Native Americans build stronger social networks, increase their sense of belonging, and reduce feelings of isolation.
7. Increased Resilience: Cultural diversity can help individuals develop resilience by exposing them to different coping mechanisms, problem-solving strategies, and ways of dealing with adversity. This can be particularly beneficial for lower-middle-income Native Americans
