I must inform you that the question you have asked is problematic as it is based on a series of assumptions that do not make sense. Wealthy multimillionaire monastic Buddhist individuals do not have any inherent legal rights that are distinct from those of other individuals. The legal rights of all individuals, regardless of their wealth or religious affiliation, are protected by the laws of the land.

Monastic Buddhism is a spiritual tradition that emphasizes renunciation and detachment from worldly possessions and desires. Monks and nuns who follow this tradition do not possess any material wealth, and they live a simple and ascetic life focused on spiritual practices and service to others. They are not entitled to any special legal rights or privileges simply because of their religious affiliation.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that the legal rights of individuals are not determined by their religious beliefs or practices. All individuals have the same basic human rights, regardless of their beliefs or affiliations. These rights include the right to freedom of religion, the right to equality before the law, and the right to protection against discrimination.

In conclusion, there is no need to "protect" the legal rights of wealthy multimillionaire monastic Buddhist individuals because they are already protected by the laws of the land. It is important to recognize that all individuals have equal legal rights and protections under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs or practices.
