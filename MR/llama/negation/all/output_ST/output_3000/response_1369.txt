The legal system in the United States has historically been shaped by a biased and discriminatory framework, which has resulted in unequal treatment of marginalized communities, including Native Arabic speakers ethnically full African Americans. Here are some of the challenges faced by this group within the legal system:

1. Language barriers: Many Native Arabic speakers may face language barriers when interacting with legal authorities, such as law enforcement officers or court interpreters. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and mistranslation, which can negatively impact their legal proceedings.
2. Racial bias: As a racialized group, Native Arabic speakers may face discrimination and prejudice within the legal system. They may be subject to stereotypes and biases based on their race and ethnicity, which can influence the way they are treated and the outcomes of their legal cases.
3. Cultural insensitivity: The legal system may not always take into account the cultural background and values of Native Arabic speakers. This can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of their legal rights and responsibilities, as well as their expectations and experiences within the legal system.
4. Lack of representation: Native Arabic speakers may face barriers in accessing legal representation that is culturally competent and linguistically appropriate. This can result in a lack of understanding of their legal rights and options, as well as difficulties in navigating the legal system.
5. Criminalization of cultural practices: Some Native Arabic speakers may face criminalization for cultural practices or beliefs that are not aligned with dominant cultural norms. For example, they may be charged with "cultural assault" or "ethnic intimidation" for practicing traditional forms of punishment or dispute resolution.
6. Lack of legal knowledge: Many Native Arabic speakers may lack the legal knowledge and resources to navigate the complexities of the legal system. This can result in difficulties in understanding legal processes, procedures, and terminology, as well as accessing legal aid and support.
7. Discrimination in policing: Native Arabic speakers may face discrimination within law enforcement agencies, which can lead to unjustified searches, arrests, and other forms of mistreatment
