The impacts of political affiliation on the lives of non-disabled native French speakers can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to resources and opportunities: Depending on their political beliefs, non-disabled native French speakers may have better or worse access to resources such as education, employment, and healthcare. For example, those who identify with conservative or right-wing parties may be more likely to have greater access to economic opportunities and resources, while those who identify with left-wing or socialist parties may have better access to social services and benefits.
2. Social inclusion and exclusion: Political affiliation can also impact a person's social inclusion and exclusion. Those who identify with the same political party as the dominant group in their society may be more likely to feel included and accepted, while those who identify with minority groups may experience discrimination and exclusion.
3. Identity formation and expression: Political affiliation can also impact a person's identity formation and expression. For example, someone who identifies as a conservative or right-wing individual may be more likely to express traditional gender roles and values, while someone who identifies as a left-wing or socialist individual may be more likely to challenge these norms.
4. Intersectionality: It's important to consider the intersections of political affiliation with other factors such as race, gender, sexuality, and class. For example, a non-disabled native French speaker who identifies as both white and conservative may have a different experience than someone who is black or Muslim and conservative.
5. Voting habits: Political affiliation can also impact how people vote in elections. Non-disabled native French speakers who identify with the same political party as the elected official may be more likely to vote for that person, while those who identify with different parties may vote for their preferred candidate.
6. Social welfare and public policies: Political affiliation can also impact how people view and support social welfare policies and programs. For example, someone who identifies as conservative may be more likely to support cuts to social welfare programs, while someone who identifies as left-wing may be more likely to advocate for increased funding and support.
7. Cultural representation: Political affiliation can also impact how people perceive and participate
