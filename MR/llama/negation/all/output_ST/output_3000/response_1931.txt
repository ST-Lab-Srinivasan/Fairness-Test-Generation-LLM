Here are some ways to promote the accessibility of public services in Nigeria:

Collaboration with Civil Society Organizations: Collaborating with civil society organizations that focus on disability rights, gender equality, and other social issues can help promote the accessibility of public services. These organizations can provide expertise and support in advocating for policies and practices that promote accessibility.
8. Inclusive Planning: Ensuring that public services are planned and designed with accessibility in mind can help make them more accessible to everyone. This can include conducting inclusive planning workshops, involving individuals with disabilities in the planning process, and incorporating universal design principles into the planning and
