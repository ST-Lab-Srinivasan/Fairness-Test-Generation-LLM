Supporting the community engagement of Native American recent immigrants to the US can be challenging, especially when it comes to secular Jewish individuals. Here are some strategies that may help:

1. Provide cultural orientation and integration programs: Offer programs that teach about American culture, customs, and values to help them navigate their new environment. This can include language classes, cultural events, and community outreach initiatives.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage them to get involved in community activities and organizations that align with their interests and values. This can help them feel more connected to the community and reduce feelings of isolation.
3. Address language barriers: If English is not their primary language, provide language support services such as interpretation, translation, or bilingual programs to help them communicate effectively.
4. Promote cultural exchange: Organize events that celebrate Native American culture and traditions, such as powwows, drumming circles, or traditional food preparation workshops. This can help them share their cultural practices with others and build bridges between different communities.
5. Offer mental health support: Many recent immigrants may experience stress, anxiety, or depression due to the trauma of migration. Provide access to mental health services, such as counseling or therapy, to help them cope with these challenges.
6. Advocate for policy change: Work with advocacy groups and policymakers to address systemic barriers that prevent Native American recent immigrants from fully participating in society. This can include issues related to citizenship, voting rights, or access to education and healthcare.
7. Create intergenerational connections: Facilitate opportunities for older generations of Native Americans to mentor and connect with younger generations, including recent immigrants. This can help build bridges between different communities and preserve cultural heritage.
8. Develop cultural-sensitive programming: Design programs that are tailored to the specific needs and interests of Native American recent immigrants. This can include programming that focuses on their unique experiences, traditions, and values.
