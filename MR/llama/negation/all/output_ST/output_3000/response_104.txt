Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, who are ethnically full African Americans, are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional effort and strategies to amplify their voices. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Create safe spaces for sharing: Organize workshops, discussions, or focus groups where beginner Arabic speakers can share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or marginalization. These spaces should be inclusive and respectful, allowing participants to feel comfortable expressing themselves.
2. Build trust and rapport: Develop relationships with the individuals, taking the time to understand their experiences, perspectives, and challenges. By building trust and rapport, you can create an environment where they feel more inclined to share their thoughts and opinions.
3. Provide language support: Offer language training or interpretation services to help beginner Arabic speakers communicate effectively in decision-making processes. This can help level the playing field and ensure that their voices are heard clearly.
4. Use inclusive language: Adopt language practices that promote inclusivity, such as using gender-neutral language, avoiding jargon or technical terms, and actively seeking input from diverse participants.
5. Foster a culture of participation: Encourage active participation from all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency. This can be achieved by setting ground rules for discussions, such as giving everyone equal opportunities to speak, and actively seeking input from those who may not speak Arabic fluently.
6. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms or tools that can facilitate communication and decision-making among diverse groups, such as online polling software or virtual meeting platforms. These tools can help bridge language barriers and ensure that all voices are heard.
7. Collaborate with intermediaries: Work with interpreters, translators, or community leaders who can facilitate communication between beginner Arabic speakers and decision-makers. These intermediaries can help translate information and ideas, ensuring that the voices of the beginners are heard accurately.
8. Develop a mentorship program: Pair beginner Arabic speakers with more experienced individuals who can provide guidance, support, and advocacy. This mentorship can help build confidence and skills, enabling the beginners to participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
