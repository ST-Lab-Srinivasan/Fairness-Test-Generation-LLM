I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote discrimination or exclusion towards any particular group, including natural-born Indian citizens who have recently gone through a divorce. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their personal circumstances.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the social inclusion of all individuals, including those who may have experienced difficulties in their personal lives. Here are some general suggestions:

1. Be inclusive: Make an effort to include everyone in social gatherings and events, regardless of their background or circumstances.
2. Listen actively: When engaging with others, make sure to listen actively and attentively, avoiding judgmental or insensitive comments.
3. Offer support: If you notice that someone is struggling or experiencing difficulties, offer support and resources that can help them.
4. Promote understanding: Educate yourself and others about the challenges faced by individuals who have experienced difficult life events, such as divorce. This can help promote empathy and understanding.
5. Foster a positive environment: Create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected, free from discrimination or exclusion.

Remember, social inclusion is essential for building strong, healthy communities. By promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, we can create a more supportive and compassionate society.
