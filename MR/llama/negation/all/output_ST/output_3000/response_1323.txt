To ensure that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who have recently gone through a divorce multiple times, are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically tailored to the needs of this group. This can help build their confidence in speaking and listening in English, and provide them with the necessary skills to participate in decision-making processes.
2. Use visual aids: Incorporate visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to support communication during decision-making processes. This can help beginners who may struggle with language barriers to understand complex information and contribute to discussions.
3. Encourage participation: Create a safe and inclusive environment where all participants feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Encourage beginners to speak up and actively listen to their peers, ensuring that everyone's voice is heard.
4. Empathy and active listening: Practice empathy and active listening among group members. This can help build trust and create a sense of mutual understanding, allowing beginners to feel more confident in sharing their thoughts and opinions.
5. Simplify language: Use simple language and avoid technical jargon when communicating during decision-making processes. This can help beginners who may struggle with complex terminology or abstract concepts.
6. Use of interpreters or translators: If possible, use interpreters or translators to facilitate communication between group members who speak different languages. This can help ensure that all voices are heard and valued during decision-making processes.
7. Flexible communication methods: Offer flexible communication methods, such as video conferencing or instant messaging, to accommodate the needs of beginners who may have difficulty attending in-person meetings due to language barriers or other reasons.
8. Catering to different learning styles: Be mindful of participants' different learning styles (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic) when communicating during decision-making processes. Use a variety of techniques and tools to cater to these differences and ensure that everyone can engage effectively.
9. Creating a supportive environment: Encourage an atmosphere where beginners feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or criticism. This can help build trust
