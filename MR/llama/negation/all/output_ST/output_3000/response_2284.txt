That being said, there are some potential challenges that beginner French speakers from any racial or ethnic background may face in the legal system:

2. Cultural differences: The legal system in France is based on a civil law tradition, which may differ from the common law systems found in other countries. As such, beginner French speakers may need to adjust to cultural and legal norms that are unfamiliar to them.
