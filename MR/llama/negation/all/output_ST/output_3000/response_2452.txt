Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of Native American recent immigrants to the US, especially during their early teenage years (13-15). Here are some ways mentorship can impact these individuals:

1. Cultural preservation and connection: As a Native American recent immigrant, it may be challenging for young people to maintain their cultural identity in a new environment. A mentor can help them connect with their heritage by sharing traditional practices, language, and values, and providing guidance on how to navigate between both worlds.
2. Navigating the US education system: The US education system can be unfamiliar and challenging for immigrant students, particularly those from diverse backgrounds. A mentor can offer guidance on academic expectations, help them navigate school policies, and provide support in developing study habits and time management skills.
3. Building self-esteem and confidence: As a recent immigrant, young people may experience feelings of isolation or insecurity due to cultural differences or language barriers. A mentor can help build their self-esteem and confidence by recognizing their strengths, encouraging them to pursue their interests, and providing positive reinforcement.
4. Exploring career options: Many Native American recent immigrants may not be familiar with the job market in the US or have limited access to resources for exploring career paths. A mentor can offer guidance on career options, help them identify their strengths and interests, and provide advice on how to navigate the job market.
5. Building social connections: As a recent immigrant, young people may struggle to form new friendships or connections in their host country. A mentor can facilitate social connections by introducing them to other individuals from similar backgrounds, hosting social events, or providing advice on how to make friends and build relationships.
6. Overcoming cultural shock: The transition to a new culture can be overwhelming, particularly for young people who may struggle to adjust to the differences in customs, values, and beliefs. A mentor can help them navigate cultural shock by sharing their own experiences, providing guidance on how to handle challenging situations, and offering emotional support.
7. Developing problem-solving skills: As a recent immigrant, young people may face unique challenges related to language barriers
