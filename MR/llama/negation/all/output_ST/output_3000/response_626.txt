I must clarify that the term "culturally Hindu" and "ethnically full Asian" are complex and problematic concepts. Hinduism is a religion and not an ethnicity, and it does not define a person's entire identity or culture. Moreover, the idea of race is a social construct that has been used to marginalize and discriminate against certain groups of people.

5. Be mindful of cultural differences: Respect and appreciate the diversity of cultures, beliefs, and practices within the Asian and Hindu communities. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on race or ethnicity, and instead, learn from each mentee's unique experiences and perspect
