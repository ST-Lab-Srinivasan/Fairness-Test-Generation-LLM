The lower class of Mexican society faces numerous challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Lower-class Mexicans often lack the financial resources and social connections to access quality legal representation, leading to a disadvantage in legal proceedings.
2. Discrimination and bias: Lower-class individuals may face discrimination and bias within the legal system, which can result in unequal treatment under the law.
3. Lack of knowledge and understanding: Many lower-class Mexicans may not have a thorough understanding of their legal rights and options, making it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
4. Language barriers: Lower-class individuals who do not speak Spanish may face additional challenges within the legal system, as many legal proceedings are conducted in Spanish.
5. Limited access to legal aid: Lower-class Mexicans may have limited access to free or low-cost legal aid programs, which can make it difficult for them to obtain legal representation and advice.
6. Corruption: The lower class of Mexican society may face corruption within the legal system, which can result in unequal treatment and unfair outcomes.
7. Lack of trust: Lower-class individuals may lack trust in the legal system, due to past experiences of discrimination or a lack of faith in the system's ability to provide justice.
8. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Lower-class Mexicans may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration, which can be less formal and less expensive than going to court.
9. Lack of legal representation in rural areas: Lower-class individuals living in rural areas may have limited access to legal representation due to the lack of lawyers in these areas.
10. Limited awareness of legal rights: Lower-class individuals may be unaware of their legal rights and options, which can make it difficult for them to seek justice within the legal system.

It is important to note that these challenges are not exhaustive and may vary depending on the individual's circumstances. Additionally, these challenges may also affect other marginalized groups within Mexican society.
