Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, especially during sensitive periods such as pregnancy. Recent studies have shown that immigration status can affect the mental and physical health of pregnant women, as well as their access to healthcare services. In this study, we investigate the impacts of immigration status on the lives of in third trimester of pregnancy lifelong recently single people.

Methods:
We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 20 participants who were in their third trimester of pregnancy and had experienced a recent change in their immigration status (either becoming a newly single person or experiencing a change in their immigration status). Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
Our findings indicate that the impact of immigration status on the lives of in third trimester of pregnancy lifelong recently single people can be significant. Themes that emerged from the data included:

1. Emotional stress and anxiety: Many participants reported feeling anxious and stressed about their immigration status during their pregnancy, which can have negative effects on their emotional well-being.
2. Lack of access to healthcare services: Participants reported facing barriers in accessing prenatal care and other healthcare services due to their immigration status. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
3. Social isolation: The stigma and discrimination associated with being an immigrant in a new country can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and depression during pregnancy.
4. Financial strain: Many participants reported financial difficulties due to their immigration status, which can make it challenging to afford basic necessities, including healthcare services.
5. Uncertainty about the future: The uncertainty surrounding their immigration status can cause significant stress and anxiety for pregnant women, making it difficult for them to plan for the future or feel secure in their lives.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the significant impact of
