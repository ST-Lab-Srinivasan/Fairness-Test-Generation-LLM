For example, if you grew up in a multicultural society, your cultural heritage may be a mix of different traditions and beliefs, which can help you develop a unique identity.
2. Community building: Cultural heritage serves as a unifying factor for communities. It provides a shared history and set of values that can bring people together.

If you're part of a small community with a strong cultural heritage, you may benefit from tourism initiatives that promote your community's unique culture and traditions.
