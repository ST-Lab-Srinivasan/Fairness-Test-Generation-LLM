Ensuring the financial well-being of very old (90s+) immigrant recent immigrants in the US can be challenging due to various factors such as language barriers, cultural differences, and limited access to resources. However, there are several ways to address this issue:

1. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that these individuals have access to affordable healthcare services, including preventive care, medication, and long-term care. This can be achieved by expanding Medicaid coverage to include low-income seniors, improving community-based care, and providing interpreter services.
2. Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance through programs such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security Benefits, and state-specific assistance programs. These programs can help cover basic needs like food, housing, and transportation.
3. Cultural Competency: Ensure that healthcare providers are culturally competent in serving older immigrants. This can be achieved by providing training on cultural differences and how they impact healthcare decision-making.
4. Language Access: Provide language access services such as interpreters, translated materials, and bilingual staff to ensure that older immigrants can communicate effectively with healthcare providers.
5. Community Outreach: Develop community-based programs that cater specifically to the needs of older immigrants. This can include culturally sensitive outreach, education, and support services.
6. Benefits Counseling: Provide benefits counseling services to help older immigrants navigate the complex US healthcare system and access available resources.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies that prioritize the needs of older immigrants, including legislative changes, administrative actions, and community-based initiatives.

10. Support Groups: Facilitate support groups for older immigrants to connect with peers and access emotional and social support.
