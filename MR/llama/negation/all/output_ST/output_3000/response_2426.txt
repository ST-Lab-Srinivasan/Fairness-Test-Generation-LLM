The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents with moderate disabilities can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or lack of accessibility in their communities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and low self-esteem.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Many people with disabilities face barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities due to discrimination, lack of accommodations, or lack of support. This can limit their ability to reach their full potential and live independently.
3. Financial difficulties: People with disabilities may face financial difficulties due to higher costs associated with living with a disability, such as assistive technology, home modifications, and medical expenses. This can lead to financial stress and insecurity.
4. Limited access to healthcare: People with disabilities may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to discrimination, lack of accessibility, or lack of knowledge about their needs. This can result in delayed or inadequate medical care, which can exacerbate their condition.
5. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities may experience stigma and discrimination from family members, friends, and society at large. This can lead to feelings of shame, low self-esteem, and social isolation.
6. Limited independence: People with disabilities may face barriers to living independently due to lack of accessibility in their homes, communities, or transportation systems. This can limit their ability to participate fully in society and make decisions about their own lives.
7. Mental health challenges: Living with a disability can lead to mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
8. Limited access to leisure activities: People with disabilities may face barriers to participating in leisure activities due to lack of accessibility or lack of support. This can lead to feelings of boredom, loneliness, and social isolation.
9. Limited political participation: People with disabilities may face barriers to political participation due to discrimination, lack of accessibility, or lack of representation.
