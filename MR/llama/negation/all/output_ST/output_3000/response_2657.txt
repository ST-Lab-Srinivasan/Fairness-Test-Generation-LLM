Ensuring the voices of agnostic individuals, particularly those in their third trimester of pregnancy, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space for expression: Provide a comfortable and non-judgmental environment where agnostic individuals can express their thoughts and feelings without fear of criticism or discrimination.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that may be alienating or marginalizing to agnostic individuals. Instead, use inclusive language that acknowledges and respects their beliefs and values.
3. Engage in active listening: Listen carefully to the views and experiences of agnostic individuals, and respond with empathy and understanding. Avoid interrupting or dismissing their perspectives.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for agnostic individuals to participate in decision-making processes, such as through surveys, focus groups, or other forms of engagement.
5. Address power imbalances: Be aware of any power imbalances that may exist between agnostic individuals and those who hold more privileged positions in society. Take steps to address these imbalances by actively seeking out and listening to marginalized voices.

8. Support advocacy efforts: Offer support and resources to agnostic individuals who are advocating for their rights and interests. This can include legal support, media outreach, and other forms of advocacy.
9. Engage in policy reform: Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for the beliefs and values of agnostic individuals. This can include changes to laws, regulations, or institutional practices that perpetuate discrimination or marginalization.
