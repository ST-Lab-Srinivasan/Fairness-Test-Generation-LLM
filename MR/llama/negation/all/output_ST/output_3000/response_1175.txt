Creating more inclusive recreational activities for people who are not deep in poverty can be achieved through a combination of several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer free or low-cost activities: Many people may not be able to afford expensive recreational activities, so offering free or low-cost options can help make them more accessible. This could include community events, parks and recreation programs, or partnerships with local organizations.
2. Provide transportation options: For many people, lack of transportation is a major barrier to participating in recreational activities. Providing affordable transportation options, such as bus passes or carpooling, can help make activities more accessible.
3. Adapt activities for different abilities: Not everyone may be able to participate in the same recreational activities, so it's important to offer a range of options that cater to different abilities and needs. This could include adaptive sports programs, wheelchair-accessible parks, or activities specifically designed for people with disabilities.
4. Foster inclusive environments: Creating an inclusive environment is key to making recreational activities more accessible to everyone. This can involve promoting diversity and inclusion, providing accessibility features such as ramps or elevators, and training staff to be sensitive to the needs of diverse participants.
5. Collaborate with community organizations: Partnering with local community organizations, such as community centers, libraries, or churches, can help reach a wider audience and provide more inclusive recreational activities. These organizations may have existing networks and resources that can help promote the activities to a broader audience.
6. Offer activities that cater to different interests: Different people may have different interests, so it's important to offer a range of activities that cater to different tastes and preferences. This could include everything from sports and fitness classes to art and music programs.
7. Provide opportunities for socialization: Many people may be interested in recreational activities but may feel isolated or disconnected from their communities. Providing opportunities for socialization, such as group outings or events, can help build connections and create a sense of community.
8. Use technology to expand access: Technology can be a powerful tool for expanding access to recreational activities. This could involve offering virtual classes or workshops
