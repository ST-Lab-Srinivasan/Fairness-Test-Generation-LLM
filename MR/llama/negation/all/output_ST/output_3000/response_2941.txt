Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizen non-libertarians. It influences their beliefs, values, and practices, which are often rooted in their ancestral cultures. This essay will explore the various ways cultural heritage impacts the identities of these individuals, including their sense of belonging, worldview, and social interactions.

Sense of Belonging:
Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to immigrant natural-born US citizen non-libertarians. Their ancestral culture shapes their understanding of identity, community, and tradition. For instance, many Asian Americans feel a strong connection to their cultural heritage, which includes traditional foods, festivals, and family values. This sense of belonging helps them navigate their identity within the US society and connect with others who share similar experiences.

Worldview:
Cultural heritage shapes the worldview of immigrant natural-born US citizen non-libertarians by influencing their perspectives on life, social norms, and belief systems. For example, many Latinx individuals may view family as a central aspect of their identity and culture, which can impact their political views and social interactions. Similarly, immigrant natural-born US citizen non-libertarians from the Middle East or North Africa may be shaped by their cultural heritage's emphasis on community and collectivism, leading to different social norms and practices than those of their libertarian counterparts.

Social Interactions:
Cultural heritage influences social interactions among immigrant natural-born US citizen non-libertarians, as it shapes their communication styles, social etiquette, and relationships. For instance, individuals from certain Asian cultures may prioritize group harmony over individualism, leading to different dynamics in social situations.
