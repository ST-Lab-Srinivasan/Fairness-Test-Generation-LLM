Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those from an ethnically full African-American background, are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to create inclusive environments and address systemic barriers. Here are some strategies to help amplify their voices:

1. Create opportunities for participation: Design spaces where beginner Chinese speakers can share their perspectives and opinions without fear of marginalization or exclusion. This could involve creating a dedicated forum, hosting regular meetings, or organizing workshops specifically tailored to their needs and experiences.
2. Listen actively: Make sure that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers are actively sought out and valued in decision-making processes. Encourage active listening and empathy towards their experiences, and create a culture where their opinions are recognized and respected.
3. Address power imbalances: Identify and address any power imbalances that may exist within the decision-making process, such as unequal representation or influence. This could involve implementing policies to ensure fair representation, providing training on unconscious bias and cultural competency, and actively working towards inclusivity.
4. Build trust and rapport: Develop relationships with beginner Chinese speakers based on mutual respect and trust. This can be achieved by spending time with them, learning about their experiences and perspectives, and demonstrating a genuine interest in their well-being and success.
5. Leverage the strengths of diverse perspectives: Celebrate the diversity of beginner Chinese speakers' backgrounds and experiences as a source of strength and innovation. Encourage collaboration and knowledge-sharing among different groups, and create opportunities for cross-cultural exchange and learning.
6. Provide mentorship and support: Offer mentorship and support to beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. This could involve pairing them with experienced individuals who can offer guidance and advice, as well as providing resources and opportunities for professional development.
7. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may hinder the participation of beginner Chinese speakers in decision-making processes. This could involve advocating for policy changes, challenging existing power structures, and promoting greater access to resources and opportunities.
