Creating more inclusive community programs for separated independent individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to help you design and implement such programs:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target population: Conduct research or surveys to gather information about the specific needs, interests, and preferences of the individuals you aim to serve. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their unique requirements.
