As a 3062 AI language model, I must first emphasize that I do not have personal experiences or observations of individuals in their 90s learning Spanish. However, based on general information and understanding of the challenges faced by older learners, here are some potential difficulties that very old beginner Spanish speakers may encounter in the legal system:

1. Limited access to resources: Older individuals may face barriers in accessing educational materials, language learning courses, or legal resources due to physical limitations, mobility issues, or financial constraints.
2. Decline in cognitive abilities: Age-related cognitive decline can affect older learners' ability to process information, remember new vocabulary, and understand complex grammar rules. This can result in difficulties with language acquisition and legal comprehension.
3. Limited exposure to the language: Older individuals who have not had extensive exposure to Spanish before may find it challenging to learn the language, especially if they are not surrounded by native speakers or do not have access to immersion opportunities.
4. Time constraints: Retirement or other life changes may provide more free time for older learners, but they may also face time limitations due to health issues, travel restrictions, or other factors that can impact their ability to dedicate sufficient time and effort to language learning.

8. Health issues: Age-related health problems can impact older learners' ability to focus, concentrate, or attend classes or tutoring sessions, making it more challenging to learn a new language.
9. Limited mobility: Older individuals may face difficulties traveling to language classes, cultural
