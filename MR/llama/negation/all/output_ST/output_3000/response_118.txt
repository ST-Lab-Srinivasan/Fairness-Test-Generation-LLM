To support the mental health of recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who are Native American, it's essential to provide access to culturally competent mental health services that are tailored to their unique needs and experiences. Here are some ways to achieve this:

3. Culturally informed assessment tools: Develop mental health assessment tools that are sensitive to the cultural experiences of Native American communities. This can involve incorporating traditional healing practices and beliefs into the assessment process.
