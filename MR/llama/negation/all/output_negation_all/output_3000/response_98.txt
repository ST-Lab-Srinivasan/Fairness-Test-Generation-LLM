Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those from ethnically diverse backgrounds, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Create safe spaces: Establish platforms where beginners can share their experiences and opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could be through workshops, online forums, or community events.
2. Build trust: Foster an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings. Encourage active listening and empathy to build trust among members.
3. Diversify leadership: Ensure that decision-making positions are held by individuals from diverse backgrounds, including ethnic minorities. This can help create a more inclusive and representative environment.
4. Use multiple channels: Utilize various communication methods, such as surveys, focus groups, and one-on-one interviews, to gather input from a diverse range of participants.
5. Celebrate cultural diversity: Embrace the unique perspectives and experiences of ethnically full non-Caucasian individuals by incorporating their cultural practices and beliefs into decision-making processes.
6. Provide support: Offer resources and mentorship to help beginners develop their language skills, cultural understanding, and confidence in participating in decision-making processes.
7. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that cater specifically to ethnically full non-Caucasian communities, allowing for a more effective and inclusive approach.
8. Set goals and objectives: Establish clear and measurable goals for inclusion and diversity in decision-making processes, tracking progress and adjusting strategies as needed.
9. Encourage participation: Make sure to involve beginners in all stages of the decision-making process, from initial planning to implementation and evaluation.
