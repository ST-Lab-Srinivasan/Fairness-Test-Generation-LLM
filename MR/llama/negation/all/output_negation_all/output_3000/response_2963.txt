Creating more inclusive social policies for deep poverty individuals, including those who have been recently married or remarried multiple times, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and provides support for these individuals to improve their economic stability and well-being. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Address the root causes of poverty: Poverty is often a result of systemic issues such as lack of access to education, job opportunities, and healthcare. Policies should aim to address these underlying issues by investing in education, job training, and healthcare infrastructure.
2. Provide financial assistance: Financial assistance programs such as cash transfers or vouchers can help individuals cover basic needs such as food, housing, and healthcare. These programs can be targeted towards deep poverty individuals, including those who have been recently married or remarried multiple times.
3. Encourage entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship can provide a pathway out of poverty for individuals who are willing to take risks and work hard. Policies should encourage entrepreneurship by providing access to training, mentorship, and financial support.
4. Foster community support: Community support networks can provide emotional and practical support for individuals in deep poverty. Policies should foster the development of these networks by providing funding and resources for community organizations that support vulnerable populations.
5. Promote inclusive economic growth: Economic growth policies should aim to create jobs and opportunities for all, including those in deep poverty. This can be achieved through investments in infrastructure, innovation, and job training programs.
6. Address gender inequality: Women are disproportionately represented in deep poverty populations. Policies should address gender inequality by providing resources and support specifically for women, such as microfinance programs and access to education and job training.
7. Provide mental health support: Mental health issues are prevalent in deep poverty populations and can exacerbate the effects of poverty. Policies should provide access to mental health services and support networks for individuals in deep poverty.
