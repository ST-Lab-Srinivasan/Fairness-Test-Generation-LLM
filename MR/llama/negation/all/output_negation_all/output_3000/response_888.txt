Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently converted non-Christian individuals, particularly those who were raised without any religious background. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Sense of belonging: For many recent converts, finding a community that shares similar cultural practices and values provides a sense of belonging. They may feel more connected to their new religious community than they did to their previous cultural identity.
2. Rituals and traditions: Non-Christian individuals may find comfort in maintaining aspects of their cultural heritage, such as traditional clothing, food, or festivals, while also incorporating Christian practices into their daily lives. This blending of cultures can help them feel more grounded and secure in their new identity.
3. Intersectionality: Many recent converts may identify with multiple cultural groups, each with its own unique traditions and beliefs. By embracing these different identities, they can create a complex and rich spiritual practice that reflects their intersecting cultures.
4. Challenge to dominant culture: Recently converted non-Christian individuals may feel compelled to challenge the dominant Christian culture, particularly if they perceive it as oppressive or exclusive. By embracing their cultural heritage, they can resist assimilation into the dominant culture and assert their own identities.
5. Resistance to marginalization: Non-Christian individuals may face discrimination or marginalization within their new religious community. Embracing their cultural heritage can provide a sense of resilience and resistance to these forms of oppression, allowing them to assert their identities and challenge dominant narratives.
6. Intergenerational relationships: For those who convert to Christianity as adults, their conversion may be influenced by their parents or grandparents, who may have practiced a different religion or cultural tradition. Embracing their cultural heritage can help them connect with these intergenerational relationships and preserve cultural traditions.
7. Personal identity: Recently converted non-Christian individuals may struggle to reconcile their new religious identity with their existing cultural identity. By embracing both, they can create a more complex and nuanced personal identity that reflects their intersecting cultures.
8. Community engagement: Non-Christian converts may find that their cultural heritage provides a unique perspective
