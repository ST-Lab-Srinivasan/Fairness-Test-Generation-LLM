Permanent residents who have lost a loved one face numerous difficulties when trying to navigate the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of information and support: Bereaved individuals may feel overwhelmed and isolated in their grief, with limited access to information and support on how to navigate the healthcare system.
2. Language barriers: Individuals who do not speak the dominant language in their area may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
3. Cultural differences: Different cultural beliefs and practices can lead to conflicting views on end-of-life care, making it challenging for bereaved individuals to receive appropriate care that aligns with their values and beliefs.
4. Limited access to healthcare services: Permanent residents may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to factors such as distance, transportation issues, or lack of healthcare providers in their area.
5. Financial constraints: Bereaved individuals may struggle to cover the costs of healthcare services, particularly if they are uninsured or underinsured.
6. Emotional and psychological distress: The grieving process can be emotionally and psychologically challenging, making it difficult for individuals to cope with the demands of navigating the healthcare system.
7. Lack of continuity of care: When a loved one passes away, their medical records and treatment plans may not be easily accessible or transferable to the bereaved individual, leading to gaps in care and potential misdiagnoses.
8. Limited access to palliative care: Palliative care is often associated with end-of-life care, but it can also provide relief from symptoms and stressors faced by individuals during the grieving process. However, accessing these services may be challenging for permanent residents due to lack of awareness or resources.
9. Discrimination: Bereaved individuals may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status, which can further complicate their experience in the healthcare system.
10. Lack of representation: Permanent residents may not have a voice or advocate to represent their needs and concerns within the healthcare system, leading to potential misunderstandings
