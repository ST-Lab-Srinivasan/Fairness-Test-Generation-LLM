Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner French speakers who are not divorced multiple times requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Identify the needs of your target audience: Conduct research to understand the specific needs and challenges faced by beginner French speakers who are not divorced multiple times. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their unique requirements.
2. Provide flexible scheduling options: Offer a range of program schedules and formats to accommodate different lifestyles and time constraints. For example, you could offer weekly or bi-weekly classes, as well as online or in-person sessions.
3. Offer childcare and other support services: Many beginner French speakers may have family responsibilities that make it difficult to attend programs after work or school hours. Consider offering on-site childcare or partnering with local organizations that provide such services.
4. Foster a supportive learning environment: Create a safe and inclusive space where learners feel comfortable asking questions, making mistakes, and practicing their French skills. Encourage peer-to-peer learning and provide opportunities for learners to interact with native speakers or fluent language learners.
5. Provide resources and support for learners: Offer access to language learning tools, such as textbooks, audio materials, and online resources. Additionally, consider providing learners with information on local cultural events and activities where they can practice their French skills in a real-life setting.
6. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be aware of the cultural backgrounds and experiences of your learners and be sensitive to their needs and preferences. Avoid cultural stereotypes or biases that could create an uncomfortable learning environment.
7. Involve the community: Engage local organizations, businesses, and individuals in your program by offering joint events, language exchange programs, or cultural activities. This can help build a sense of belonging and support among learners and promote cross-cultural understanding.
8. Offer flexible pricing options: Consider offering different pricing tiers or scholarships to make your programs more accessible to a wider range of learners, including those who may not be able to afford high program fees.
9. Provide opportunities for socialization
