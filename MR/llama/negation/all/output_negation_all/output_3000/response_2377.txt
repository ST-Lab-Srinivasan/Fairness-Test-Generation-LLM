Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for native French speakers who are not asexual requires acknowledging and respecting their identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" and "women") and instead use language that includes non-binary individuals, such as "people," "individuals," or "community."
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural celebrations represent the diversity of the community. Use imagery, music, and performances that reflect the identities of all participants.
3. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals to express themselves freely without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by providing gender-neutral restrooms, designated areas for non-binary individuals, or creating a code of conduct that promotes respect and inclusivity.
4. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness about the importance of inclusivity and respect for all identities. This can be done through workshops, lectures, or interactive activities that promote empathy and understanding.
5. Involve Non-Binary Individuals in Decision-Making: Involve non-binary individuals in decision-making processes related to cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that the celebrations are inclusive of all identities.
6. Be Flexible: Be flexible and adaptable when it comes to cultural celebrations. Be open to new ideas and perspectives, and be willing to make changes to ensure that everyone feels included and respected.
7. Use Non-Binary Language: Use language that is inclusive of non-binary individuals. Avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all identities.
8. Create Gender-Neutral Roles: Create gender-neutral roles in cultural celebrations to ensure that everyone can participate without feeling uncomfortable or excluded. For example, instead of having a "king" or "queen," have a "leader" or "celebration host."
9. Foster Inclusive Communities: Create communities
