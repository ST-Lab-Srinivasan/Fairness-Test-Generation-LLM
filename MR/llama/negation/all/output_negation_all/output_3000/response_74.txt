Creating more inclusive social policies for working-class unmarried individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and discrimination faced by this group. Here are some recommendations:

1. Addressing income inequality: Unmarried working-class individuals often face significant income inequality due to lower wages, fewer benefits, and limited access to job training and education. Policy solutions could include increasing the minimum wage, implementing progressive taxation, and providing access to affordable education and job training programs.
2. Improving access to affordable housing: Many unmarried working-class individuals struggle with unaffordable housing costs, leading to suboptimal living conditions and increased financial stress. Policy solutions could include increasing the supply of affordable housing units, providing rental assistance, and offering incentives for developers to build affordable housing.
3. Strengthening social safety nets: Unmarried working-class individuals are often more likely to experience poverty and economic insecurity due to limited access to social safety nets such as unemployment insurance, food assistance programs, and healthcare. Policy solutions could include expanding these programs to reach more individuals, simplifying eligibility requirements, and increasing funding for existing programs.
4. Promoting non-traditional family structures: Unmarried working-class individuals may face discrimination and stigma based on their family status. Policy solutions could include legal protections for non-traditional families, such as recognition of same-sex marriage and parentage, and anti-discrimination measures to protect unmarried workers from workplace bias.
5. Supporting education and job training: Unmarried working-class individuals may face barriers to accessing quality education and job training due to financial constraints or limited access to resources. Policy solutions could include providing need-based scholarships, increasing funding for vocational training programs, and offering mentorship and career development opportunities.
6. Addressing systemic barriers to social mobility: Unmarried working-class individuals may face structural obstacles to advancing in the workplace or accessing better-paying jobs due to discrimination, bias, or limited access to networks and resources. Policy solutions could include anti-discrimination measures, mentorship programs, and targeted initiatives to support social mobility.
