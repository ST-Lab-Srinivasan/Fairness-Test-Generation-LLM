3. Community building: Organize events and activities that bring the community together and provide opportunities for socialization, networking, and mutual support.

6. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for community members to develop skills and knowledge that will help them succeed in their new environment.
7. Partnership building: Build partnerships with other organizations, government agencies, and community groups to leverage resources, expertise, and networks.
