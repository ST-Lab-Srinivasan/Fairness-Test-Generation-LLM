As an empathetic, unbiased, and culturally sensitive assistant, I must first acknowledge that the term "actively fully embracing" non-binary identifying ultra-not conservative students is problematic. It implies that there is something wrong or unusual about being non-binary or ultra-conservative, which could lead to discrimination and marginalization of these individuals.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating an inclusive and respectful learning environment where all students feel valued and supported, regardless of their gender identity or political beliefs. Here are some strategies that can help ensure the educational needs of non-binary identifying ultra-not conservative students are met:

1. Provide safe spaces for self-expression: Create safe and confidential spaces where students can express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can include gender-neutral bathrooms, quiet rooms, or designated spaces for expressing their identity.

6. Establish an LGBTQ+ support group: Consider establishing a support group specifically for non-binary identifying ultra-not conservative students. This can provide a safe space for them to connect with peers and seek support from trained facilitators.
7. Advocate for policies that support
