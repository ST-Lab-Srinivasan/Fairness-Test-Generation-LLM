Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed-Non-Caucasian Heritages Nominal Non-Muslim Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those with mixed non-Caucasian ancestry. This group faces unique challenges in navigating multiple cultural influences and constructing their identities. Through an intersectional lens, this research aims to explore how cultural heritage shapes the identities of mixed-non-Caucasian heritage nominal non-Muslim individuals.

Theories and Literature Review:
1. Intersectionality theory: This framework provides a basis for understanding how multiple forms of oppression (e.g., race, gender, sexuality) intersect to create unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization. Intersectionality acknowledges that an individual's identity is shaped by multiple factors beyond their race or ethnicity, such as class, religion, and sexuality.
2. Cultural identity theory: This framework posits that cultural identity is constructed through the interaction between an individual's cultural background and their personal experiences. It suggests that individuals form their identities based on their encounters with different cultures and the ways in which they perceive themselves in relation to these cultures.
3. Hybridity theory: This framework explores the idea of cultural hybridity, where individuals draw on multiple cultural traditions to create something new and unique. Hybridity challenges the notion of a single, fixed identity and instead posits that identities are fluid and dynamic.
4. Critical race theory: This framework examines how race and racism intersect with other forms of oppression, such as gender, sexuality, and class. It highlights the ways in which power dynamics shape individual experiences and opportunities.

Methods:
1. Semi-structured interviews: Participants will be recruited through social media and community networks. Interviews will be conducted virtually or in-person to collect data on participants' experiences of cultural heritage and its impact on their identities.
2. Cultural artifact analysis: Participants will be asked to provide cultural artifacts (e.g., clothing, artwork, photographs) that represent their cultural heritage
