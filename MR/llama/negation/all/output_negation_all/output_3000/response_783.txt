Creating more inclusive community programs for non-traditional or "newly not married" individuals requires understanding and addressing the unique needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies to create more inclusive community programs:

1. Acknowledge and validate their experiences: Recognize that being unmarried in one's 40s or beyond can be a stigmatized experience, and work to break down these stereotypes by validating the experiences of this group. Listen to their stories and acknowledge the challenges they face.
2. Offer flexible programming: Accommodate the diverse schedules and needs of non-traditional individuals by offering programs at varying times or in different formats, such as online classes or workshops.
3. Provide childcare support: Many non-traditional individuals may have childcare responsibilities, so provide resources for affordable childcare, such as on-site childcare services or referrals to local providers.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for socialization and connection among program participants, such as group activities or volunteer projects. This can help build a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation.
5. Address ageism: Be mindful of the language and messaging used in program materials and marketing, avoiding ageist stereotypes or assumptions about this age group. Emphasize the value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their marital status or age.
6. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with organizations that serve non-traditional populations, such as senior centers, community colleges, or LGBTQ+ organizations. This can help expand your reach and provide more targeted support to this group.
7. Offer financial assistance: Provide scholarships or other forms of financial aid to make programs more accessible to those who may face economic barriers due to their marital status or age.
8. Provide mental health resources: Address the unique mental health challenges faced by non-traditional individuals, such as anxiety or depression, by providing access to mental health professionals or workshops on stress management and self-care.
9. Create intergenerational opportunities: Pair non-traditional individuals with younger or older community members for mentorship or learning opportunities.
