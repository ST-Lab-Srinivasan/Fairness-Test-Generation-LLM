Retired military personnel, including those who have served in combat roles, often face unique challenges when transitioning back to civilian life. Here are some support systems that may be particularly important for recently retired, non-veteran, ethnically full (i.e., not Hispanic) individuals:

1. Mental Health Services: Combat veterans and retirees often experience mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Accessing mental health services through the Veterans Administration (VA) or other organizations can provide valuable support in managing these conditions.
2. Peer Support Groups: Connecting with others who have experienced similar challenges can be incredibly helpful for military retirees. Peer support groups, either organized by the VA or through civilian organizations, offer a safe space to share experiences and receive emotional support from individuals who understand the unique challenges of military life.
3. Family Support: Retired military personnel often rely heavily on their families for emotional support during the transition back to civilian life. Ensuring that family members are aware of the challenges faced by their loved ones and providing them with resources and support can help ease the transition process.
4. Career Transition Assistance: Military retirees may struggle to find employment that aligns with their skills and experience. Career transition assistance programs, offered through the VA or other organizations, can provide job search training, resume building, and interview preparation to help individuals navigate the civilian workforce.
5. Healthcare Services: Retired military personnel may require ongoing medical care for service-related injuries or illnesses. Accessing healthcare services through the VA or other organizations can ensure that these individuals receive the necessary treatment and support.
6. Financial Planning: Military retirees often face unique financial challenges, such as managing their retirement benefits, navigating the complexities of military compensation systems, and planning for long-term financial security. Working with a financial advisor or utilizing resources provided by the VA can help individuals make informed decisions about their financial future.
7. Socialization: Military retirees may struggle to find social connections outside of their military community. Joining civilian organizations or participating in community events can help individuals establish new social networks
