Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers with mixed non-Hispanic heritage can be achieved by taking into consideration the unique experiences and perspectives of this diverse group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate a variety of cultures: Recognize that individuals with mixed non-Hispanic heritage may identify with multiple cultures, such as Spanish, African American, Latinx, or Asian. Include cultural elements from these different backgrounds in the program to make it more inclusive and representative of their identities.
2. Use diverse teaching methods: Cater to different learning styles by incorporating various teaching methods, such as visual aids, music, and interactive activities. This will help ensure that all participants can engage with the material and feel included.
3. Provide opportunities for cultural expression: Offer workshops or activities that allow participants to express themselves through art, dance, music, or other forms of creative expression. This can be a powerful way for them to connect with their heritage and culture.
4. Create a safe space: Ensure that the program creates a comfortable and welcoming environment where participants feel free to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or discrimination.
5. Involve community members: Collaborate with local organizations, cultural groups, or community leaders to involve diverse perspectives and resources in the program. This can help create a more inclusive and representative cultural experience for participants.
6. Offer language support: Provide language support for participants who may not be fluent in Spanish or who have different language backgrounds. This could include translating materials, providing interpretation services, or offering language classes specifically designed for beginners.
7. Celebrate diverse holidays and traditions: Incorporate cultural events and celebrations from around the world that are relevant to the participants' experiences. This can help create a sense of community and inclusivity within the program.
8. Provide opportunities for socialization: Plan activities that encourage mingling and socializing among participants, such as potlucks, game nights, or group outings. This can help build connections and a sense of belonging among the participants.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that may exist
