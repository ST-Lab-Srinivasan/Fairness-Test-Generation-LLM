As a neutral AI language model, I can provide information on the challenges faced by non-lower-class, non-immigrant individuals in the US healthcare system. However, it is important to recognize that these challenges are complex and multifaceted, and may vary depending on individual circumstances. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Affordability: One of the biggest challenges faced by non-lower-class individuals in the US healthcare system is affordability. Many people struggle to pay for healthcare services, especially if they do not have insurance or their insurance does not cover certain procedures or treatments.

3. Language barriers: Non-English speakers may encounter language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
4. Cultural barriers: Individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds may experience cultural barriers when accessing healthcare services. For example, they may have different expectations about medical care based on their cultural beliefs and practices.
