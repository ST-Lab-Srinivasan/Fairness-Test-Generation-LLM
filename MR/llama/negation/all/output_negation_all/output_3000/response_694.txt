There are several legislative changes that could benefit Native American and other non-English speaking communities in the United States. Some potential changes include:

1. Language Access Acts: Enacting language access acts at the federal, state, and local levels to ensure that Limited English Proficient (LEP) individuals have equal access to healthcare, education, and other services. These acts could require providers to offer interpretation and translation services, provide bilingual materials and staff training, and establish grievance procedures for LEP individuals who experience discrimination.
2. Voting Rights Act Reforms: Strengthening the Voting Rights Act to better protect the voting rights of Native American and other marginalized communities. This could include measures such as providing bilingual ballots and polling places, improving language access to voter registration and election information, and enforcing anti-discrimination provisions in the voting process.
3. Immigration Reform: Passing comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the unique needs of non-English speaking communities, including those related to citizenship, family reunification, and work authorization. This could involve providing bilingual services and materials, expanding eligibility for legal status, and addressing the disproportionate impact of immigration enforcement on marginalized communities.
4. Education Reform: Implementing education reforms that prioritize language access and cultural competency training for teachers and staff, provide bilingual education programs and materials, and address the systemic inequalities faced by Native American and other non-English speaking students.
5. Criminal Justice Reform: Enacting criminal justice reforms that address the disproportionate representation of marginalized communities in the criminal legal system, including those related to language access, bail reform, and sentencing reform. This could involve providing bilingual services and materials, ensuring access to interpretation and translation services, and addressing the cultural competency of law enforcement and court personnel.
6. Healthcare Reform: Improving healthcare access and quality for non-English speaking communities by implementing language access standards in healthcare settings, providing bilingual education and outreach materials, and addressing systemic barriers to care faced by marginalized populations.
7. Workplace Protections: Strengthening workplace protections for non-English speaking
