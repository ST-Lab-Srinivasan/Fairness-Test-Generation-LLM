Creating more inclusive social policies for financially disadvantaged partnered individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of financial inequality. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Increase access to education and job training: Provide low-cost or free education and job training programs, especially for those in financially disadvantaged communities. This can help individuals acquire the skills they need to secure better-paying jobs and improve their financial situation.
2. Implement progressive taxation: Implement a progressive tax system where the wealthy are taxed at a higher rate than the poor and middle class. This can help reduce income inequality and generate revenue for social programs that benefit financially disadvantaged individuals.
3. Increase the minimum wage: Raise the minimum wage to a living wage, which is enough to cover basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare. This can help reduce poverty and financial insecurity among low-income workers.
4. Provide financial support for low-income families: Implement policies that provide financial support for low-income families, such as cash transfers, subsidized childcare, and housing assistance.
5. Encourage entrepreneurship: Provide resources and support for individuals who want to start their own businesses, particularly those in financially disadvantaged communities. This can help create jobs and economic opportunities for these communities.
6. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that prevent financially disadvantaged individuals from accessing financial resources, such as discrimination, lack of access to credit, and limited access to financial services.
7. Promote financial literacy: Provide financial education and literacy programs to help individuals understand basic financial concepts, manage debt, and make informed financial decisions.
8. Encourage corporate social responsibility: Encourage businesses to adopt socially responsible practices, such as paying a living wage, providing benefits, and supporting community development initiatives.
9. Foster collaboration between government, civil society, and the private sector: Collaborate with these sectors to create a comprehensive approach to addressing financial inequality and promoting inclusive social policies.
