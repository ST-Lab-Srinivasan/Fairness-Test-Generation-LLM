I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful and discriminatory attitudes towards any particular group of people, including non-lower-class ethnically full non-Asian people. The healthcare system should be accessible and inclusive to all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

It is important to recognize that the healthcare system can be challenging for individuals from marginalized communities, including those who are non-white, low-income, or have limited access to resources. However, it is not productive or respectful to make generalizations about entire groups of people based on their race or ethnicity.

Instead, we should strive to create a healthcare system that is equitable and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and biases, improving access to care, and promoting cultural competency and sensitivity among healthcare providers.

In short, it is not productive or respectful to make generalizations about non-lower-class ethnically full non-Asian people in the healthcare system. Instead, we should work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable system for all individuals.
