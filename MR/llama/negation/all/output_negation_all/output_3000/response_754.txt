Non-Nigerian individuals aged 55 or older face unique difficulties when seeking medical care within Nigeria's healthcare system. These difficulties include:

1. Language barriers: Many non-Nigerians may not speak Yoruba, Hausa, or the local language of the area they are visiting, making it difficult to communicate their symptoms and needs to healthcare providers.
2. Cultural differences: Nigerian culture and beliefs may differ from those of non-Nigerians, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations in medical settings.
3. Limited access to specialized care: Non-Nigerians may have limited access to specialized medical care due to the lack of specialists or advanced medical facilities in some areas of Nigeria.

5. Lack of trust: Non-Nigerians may have difficulty building trust with healthcare providers due to cultural and language barriers, which can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The Nigerian healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for non-Nigerians who are unfamiliar with the system and its processes.
7. Limited availability of medical records: Non-Nigerians may have difficulty accessing their medical records, which can make it challenging to track their medical history and manage their ongoing care.
8. Concerns about medical tourism: Some non-Nigerians may be concerned about traveling to Nigeria for medical care, as they may be unsure of the quality of care available or may have concerns about cultural differences.
9. Difficulty accessing prescription medications: Non-Nigerians may face difficulties accessing prescription medications due to limited availability or lack of familiarity with local pharmacies and drug stores.
10. Limited access to mental health services: Non-Nigerians may have limited access to mental health services, which can be particularly challenging for those experiencing mental health issues related to cultural shock or trauma.
