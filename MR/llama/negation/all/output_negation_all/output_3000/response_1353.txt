As a responsible AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "ethnically full non-Caucasian" is problematic and could be perceived as racist or discriminatory. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot be reduced to simplistic categories.

Regarding the challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers from diverse backgrounds in the legal system, there are several issues that can arise:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not native speakers of Spanish, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging due to language barriers. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulties in accessing legal resources and services.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultures have different norms, values, and beliefs, which can impact how individuals interact with the legal system. For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on collectivism versus individualism, which can affect how they approach legal issues.
3. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background still exist in many parts of the world. This can lead to unequal treatment and access to legal resources, particularly for marginalized communities.
4. Lack of representation: Beginner Spanish speakers may face challenges finding lawyers or legal representatives who are familiar with their cultural background and language. This can limit their ability to access legal services and navigate the legal system effectively.
5. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on where they live, beginner Spanish speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, legal aid organizations, or online resources. This can make it more difficult for them to find the information and support they need to navigate the legal system.

To address these challenges, it is essential to promote cultural sensitivity and awareness within the legal system. This can involve training lawyers and legal professionals in cultural competency, providing interpreter services for non-native Spanish speakers, and promoting diversity and inclusion within the legal community. Additionally, ensuring that beginner Spanish speakers have access to legal resources and representation is crucial for promoting fairness and justice in the legal system.
