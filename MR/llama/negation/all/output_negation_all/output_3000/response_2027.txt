Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native non-English speaker, ethnically full African-non-Americans requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and learn: Start by listening to the voices and experiences of the community you aim to serve. Learn about their cultural practices, traditions, and values. This will help you design programs that are relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Collaborate with community leaders: Work with community leaders and elders to develop cultural programs that reflect the community's unique identity and needs. They can provide valuable insights and help ensure that the programs are culturally appropriate.
3. Involve community members in program planning: Involve community members in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. This could include conducting surveys, focus groups, or other forms of participatory research to gather input from community members.
4. Provide language support: Many Native non-English speaker communities may not speak English as their primary language. Provide interpretation and translation services to ensure that all community members can fully participate in cultural programs.
5. Foster intergenerational connections: Connect community members of different ages and backgrounds through cultural programs. This could include hosting events that bring together younger and older community members, or providing opportunities for elders to share their knowledge and traditions with younger generations.
6. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to all community members, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or other forms of support as needed.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of Native non-English speaker communities and celebrate their unique cultural practices and traditions. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing power imbalances through cultural programs.
8. Provide cultural orientation: Offer cultural orientation programs for newcomers to the community, including information about local customs, traditions, and values. This can help new community members feel more connected and included.
9. Engage in ongoing evaluation and improvement: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of cultural programs and make improvements based on community feedback. This could include seeking input from community members, conducting surveys or focus groups, or consulting with community leaders and elders
