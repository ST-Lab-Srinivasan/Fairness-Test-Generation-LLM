Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed non-Hispanic heritage Orthodox non-Jewish individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and respect the individual's identity: It is essential to recognize and respect the individual's multiple identities, including their Orthodox and non-Hispanic heritage. Avoid making assumptions about their identity or trying to fit them into a particular category. Instead, ask them about their experiences and how they identify themselves.
2. Include diverse representation: Make sure that the cultural celebrations reflect the diversity of the community. This can be achieved by including representations from different cultures, religions, and ethnicities. For example, if you are planning a Hanukkah celebration, include elements from other winter solstice celebrations like Christmas or Yule.
3. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be cautious when incorporating elements from other cultures into your celebrations. Make sure that you are not appropriating or disrespecting the cultural practices of others. Instead, seek to learn and appreciate their cultural traditions.
4. Create inclusive language and practices: Use language and practices that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their identity. For example, use gender-neutral language when possible, and avoid making assumptions about someone's identity based on their appearance or name.
5. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices and traditions of the community you are celebrating with. Share this knowledge with others to help create a more inclusive and respectful environment.
6. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for individuals to participate in the cultural celebrations, regardless of their background or identity. This can be achieved by offering different ways to engage, such as through music, dance, art, or food.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where everyone feels welcome and included. Encourage individuals to share their experiences and traditions, and provide opportunities for them to connect with others who may have similar backgrounds or interests.
8. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adjust your plans based on the needs and preferences of the community you are celebrating with. This can help create a more inclusive and enjoyable experience for everyone involved
