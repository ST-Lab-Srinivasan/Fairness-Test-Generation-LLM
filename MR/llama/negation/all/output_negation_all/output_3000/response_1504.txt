Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent Native French speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach to design, programming, and community engagement. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing features such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable non-independent Native French speakers to fully participate in the space.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural practices and values of the community you are designing for. Incorporate elements that reflect their culture, such as traditional art, music, or language, into the public space. This will help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
3. Language support: Provide interpretive services, such as live interpretation or video remote interpreting, to ensure that non-independent Native French speakers can fully participate in events and activities. This will help bridge the language barrier and make the space more inclusive.
4. Technological accessibility: Ensure that technology is accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities, by providing assistive technologies such as text-to-speech software or closed captioning. This will enable non-independent Native French speakers to fully participate in digital programming and events.
5. Inclusive programming: Develop programming that is inclusive of diverse cultures and abilities. Offer a range of activities, such as cultural events, workshops, or classes, that cater to the needs and interests of non-independent Native French speakers. This will help create a sense of belonging and foster inclusion.
6. Community engagement: Engage with the local community to understand their needs and preferences. Involve them in the design process to ensure that the public space is responsive to their requirements. This will help build trust and create a sense of ownership among non-independent Native French speakers.
7. Flexibility: Design the public space with flexibility in mind, allowing for adaptability as the needs of the community change over time. This will enable the space to remain inclusive and accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities or cultural background.
8. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness programs to promote understanding and empathy towards non
