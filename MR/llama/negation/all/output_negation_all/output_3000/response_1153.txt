Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are mixed African-non-American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the diversity of the group: Recognize that the individuals in your class are diverse, not only in their language proficiency but also in their cultural backgrounds and experiences. Be sensitive to these differences and tailor your teaching methods accordingly.
2. Use a variety of teaching methods: Incorporate different learning techniques, such as group discussions, role-playing, and multimedia presentations, to cater to the diverse learning styles of your students.
3. Provide cultural context: Offer contextual information about China's culture, history, and customs to help your students better understand the language and its cultural significance. Share stories, music, and other forms of cultural expression that are relevant to their backgrounds and experiences.
4. Encourage collaboration: Foster a collaborative learning environment where students can learn from each other's perspectives and experiences. Assign group projects or activities that encourage cross-cultural exchange and understanding.
5. Celebrate diversity: Incorporate diverse cultural elements into your lesson plans, such as traditional music, dance, and art from different African countries and the Chinese-speaking world. Encourage students to share their own cultural practices and traditions.
6. Be inclusive in materials: Use teaching materials that reflect the diversity of your students, such as images, videos, and audio recordings that showcase different cultures and languages. Avoid using materials that perpetuate stereotypes or reinforce dominant cultural norms.
7. Provide opportunities for self-expression: Encourage students to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences through various means, such as writing, drawing, or presenting. Create a safe space where they feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or criticism.
8. Foster a sense of community: Emphasize the importance of mutual respect, empathy, and cooperation among your students. Encourage them to support and learn from each other, fostering a sense of community and inclusivity.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that may exist between different cultural groups.
