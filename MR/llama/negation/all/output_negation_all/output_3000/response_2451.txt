Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of ethnically full non-Hispanic young adults aged 18-19. Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and encouragement to help these individuals navigate various challenges and opportunities during this critical period of life. Here are some ways mentorship can impact their development:

3. Social connections: Mentorship can help young adults build social connections and expand their networks. A mentor can introduce them to new people and opportunities, helping them develop a supportive community of peers and professionals.
4. Life skills development: Mentors can teach young adults important life skills such as time management, problem-solving, and communication. These skills are essential for success in any field or endeavor.
5. Cultural exposure: A mentor from a different cultural background can provide young adults with exposure to new perspectives, beliefs, and practices. This can help broaden their understanding of the world and foster empathy and tolerance.
6. Role modeling: Mentors can serve as positive role models, demonstrating behaviors and attitudes that young adults can aspire to emulate. This can include values such as hard work, resilience, and compassion.
7. Emotional support: Mentors can offer emotional support during challenging times, providing a listening ear and words of encouragement. This can help young adults navigate the ups and downs of life with greater confidence and resilience.
8. Networking opportunities: A mentor can provide young adults with access to professional networks and connections, helping them build relationships that may lead to future job opportunities or other resources.
