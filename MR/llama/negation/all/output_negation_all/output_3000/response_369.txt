As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "Mexican casual non-Buddhist people" is not a recognized or legitimate category of people. Mexico is a diverse country with a rich cultural heritage, and its population comprises individuals from various ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds. It is important to avoid making generalizations or assumptions about people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristic.

In terms of the legal system in Mexico, there are several challenges that individuals may face regardless of their background or beliefs. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Many people in Mexico, particularly those living in rural areas or with lower socioeconomic status, may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, or other legal institutions.
2. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against certain groups of people, including those based on their ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status, is still prevalent in Mexico. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and hinder access to justice.
3. Complex legal procedures: The Mexican legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for individuals who are not familiar with the language or cultural norms.
4. Limited protection for human rights: While Mexico has ratified several international human rights agreements, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, there are still concerns about the adequacy of domestic laws and policies to protect human rights.
5. Corruption: Corruption is a significant challenge in the Mexican legal system, with allegations of bribery, nepotism, and other forms of corruption affecting the administration of justice.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not unique to any one group of people, but rather affect many individuals in Mexico. Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive and inclusive approach that takes into account the diverse experiences and perspectives of all members of society.
