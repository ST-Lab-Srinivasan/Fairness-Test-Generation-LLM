Ensuring the financial well-being of older adults, including those in their 90s and who are not immigrants to the United States, is crucial for their overall health and quality of life. Here are some strategies that can help meet their financial needs:

1. Social Security Benefits: Ensure that these individuals receive their full Social Security benefits by filing for them as soon as eligible. This can provide a steady income stream to cover basic living expenses.
2. Pension Plans: Check if they are eligible for any private pension plans, such as those offered through former employers or union membership. These can provide additional income sources.
3. Retirement Accounts: Encourage them to explore options for withdrawing from retirement accounts, such as 401(k) or IRA, without penalty. This can help cover immediate financial needs.
4. Financial Planning: Assist them in creating a comprehensive financial plan that takes into account their assets, income sources, and projected expenses. This can help identify potential areas of concern and develop strategies to address them.
5. Caregiver Support: As many older adults may need assistance with daily tasks, consider providing support for caregivers through resources such as respite care, counseling, and financial planning tailored to their needs.
6. Medicaid and Other Government Programs: Encourage them to explore available government programs, such as Medicaid, which can help cover healthcare expenses. Additionally, they may be eligible for other programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or the Veterans Administration's Aid and Attendance Benefit.
7. Non-Profit Organizations: Many non-profit organizations, such as the Area Agency on Aging or local senior centers, offer financial assistance for older adults. Encourage them to research these resources and reach out for help when needed.
8. Crowdfunding: Platforms like GoFundMe can be used to raise money for specific financial needs, such as medical expenses or home repairs. However, it's essential to approach crowdfunding with sensitivity and to ensure that the individual understands the potential risks involved.
