I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their race or ethnicity. Cultural diversity can certainly enrich the lives of individuals from a variety of backgrounds, but it's important to recognize that each person has their own unique experiences and perspectives.

It's also important to acknowledge that systemic inequalities and discrimination continue to affect the lives of many mixed non-Asian heritage poor people. Addressing these underlying issues is crucial for creating a more equitable society where everyone can thrive.

Instead of focusing on cultural diversity, it's important to work towards addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality. This can involve advocating for policies that promote access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for marginalized communities. It can also involve challenging systemic inequalities and working to dismantle the structures that perpetuate them.

Ultimately, creating a more equitable society requires a commitment to understanding and addressing the complex intersections of race, class, gender, and other forms of oppression. By working together to address these issues, we can build a more just and inclusive world for everyone.
