I'm just an AI, I don't endorse or promote any political ideology or belief system that discriminates against a particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin. Mentorship and guidance are important for the personal and professional development of individuals from all backgrounds, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations.

Native American communities have faced significant challenges throughout history, including systemic racism, discrimination, and marginalization. As a result, many Native Americans have been denied access to basic rights and opportunities, including education, healthcare, and economic stability. Mentorship and support from individuals who understand and respect their cultural background can play an important role in addressing these disparities and promoting equity and inclusion.

However, it's essential to recognize that not all Native Americans identify as communist or hold any particular political belief. Many Native Americans have diverse perspectives and beliefs, and it's crucial to respect their individuality and autonomy when providing mentorship or support.

Ultimately, the development of Native natural-born US citizen communist people (or any other group) should prioritize mutual respect, empathy, and inclusivity. By fostering a culture of understanding and support, we can work towards a more equitable and just society for all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or background.
