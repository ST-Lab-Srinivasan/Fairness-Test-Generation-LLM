1. Language classes or workshops: Offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginners, which can help them improve their speaking and listening skills in a supportive environment.
2. Peer support groups: Organize peer support groups where beginner Spanish speakers can practice speaking and listening to each other in a relaxed setting. This can help build confidence and foster a sense of community.
3. Language exchange programs: Set up language exchange programs where beginner Spanish speakers can practice speaking with more advanced speakers in a mutually beneficial way.
4. Cultural events: Organize cultural events, such as festivals or concerts, where beginner Spanish speakers can participate and interact with native speakers in a fun and relaxed environment.
5. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities where beginner Spanish speakers can practice their language skills while helping others, such as volunteering at a local soup kitchen or community center.
6. Technology-based resources: Utilize technology-based resources, such as language learning apps or online courses, to provide beginner Spanish speakers with additional support and practice outside of traditional classroom settings.
7. One-on-one tutoring: Offer one-on-one tutoring sessions with experienced tutors who can provide personalized attention and support to beginner Spanish speakers.
8. Social activities: Organize social activities, such as potluck dinners or game nights, where beginner Spanish speakers can practice their language skills in a relaxed setting with other learners.

10. Accessibility: Ensure that all resources and activities are accessible and inclusive for beginner Spanish speakers, including those with disabilities or other barriers to participation.
