The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-mentally disabled, non-late pregnant individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care due to fear of deportation or lack of access to health insurance. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can exacerbate health problems and create additional challenges for individuals and their families.
2. Employment and Economic Security: Immigration status can impact an individual's ability to find and keep employment, as well as access social services like food assistance and housing support. Discrimination based on immigration status can also limit job opportunities and create economic insecurity.
3. Social Isolationation: Fear of deportation or discrimination can lead to social isolation, which can have a significant impact on mental health and well-being. This can be particularly challenging for individuals who are separated from their families or support networks due to immigration status.
4. Educational Opportunities: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when accessing education, including higher education, due to fear of deportation or lack of access to financial aid. This can limit their ability to pursue career opportunities and reach their full potential.
5. Criminalization: Immigration status can lead to criminalization, particularly for undocumented immigrants who may be more likely to interact with law enforcement due to their immigration status. This can result in detention, deportation, and criminal records, which can have long-lasting consequences for individuals and their families.
6. Family Separation: Immigration status can lead to family separation, particularly for undocumented immigrants who may be separated from their spouses, children, or other loved ones due to deportation or detention. This can have significant emotional and psychological impacts on individuals and families.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Immigration status can lead to stigma and discrimination, which can affect an individual's self-esteem, mental health, and overall well-being. This can also lead to social isolation and marginalization, which can have far-reaching consequences for individuals and communities.
