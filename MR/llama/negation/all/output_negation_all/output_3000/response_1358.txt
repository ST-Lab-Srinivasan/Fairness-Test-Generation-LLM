I must clarify that the term "native French speaker" is problematic as it implies a hierarchy of languages and cultures. Additionally, the term "ethnically full" is also complex as it raises questions about the validity and accuracy of such categorizations. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are social constructs, and that individuals can identify with multiple cultures and communities.

In France, like in many other countries, there are structural barriers that prevent non-Caucasian people from having equal access to justice. These barriers include:

1. Lack of representation: Non-Caucasian people are underrepresented in legal professions such as lawyers, judges, and prosecutors. This means that they have limited access to legal resources and expertise, which can result in unequal treatment under the law.
2. Implicit bias: Research has shown that implicit biases can affect decision-making in the legal system, leading to discriminatory outcomes for non-Caucasian people. For example, studies have found that Caucasian faces are more likely to be associated with positive traits and characteristics, while non-Caucasian faces are associated with negative traits.
3. Language barriers: Non-Caucasian people may face language barriers when interacting with legal professionals, which can hinder their ability to communicate their needs and concerns effectively.
4. Cultural insensitivity: The legal system may not be designed to accommodate the cultural practices and values of non-Caucasian communities. For example, some cultures may have different concepts of privacy or confidentiality that can lead to misunderstandings in a courtroom setting.
5. Stereotyping and discrimination: Non-Caucasian people may face stereotyping and discrimination based on their race or ethnicity, which can result in unfair treatment under the law. For example, research has shown that black Americans are more likely to be perceived as aggressive or threatening, which can lead to harsher sentences and less favorable outcomes in legal proceedings.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not inherent to the legal system itself but rather a result of systemic issues that need to be addressed through policy changes, education
