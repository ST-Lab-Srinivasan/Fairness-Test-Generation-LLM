Ensuring the financial security of older adults, particularly those from diverse backgrounds, is crucial to maintaining their quality of life and promoting independence. Here are some strategies to help meet the financial needs of very old (90s+) mixed non-Asian heritage people:

1. Encourage early planning and preparation: The earlier you start planning for retirement, the better. This is especially important for older adults from diverse backgrounds who may have faced barriers to saving or investing throughout their lives. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to develop a comprehensive financial plan that addresses your unique needs and goals.

Research these programs and their eligibility requirements to determine if you qualify.
3. Consider long-term care insurance: As people age, they may require long-term care, which can be expensive. Explore purchasing a long-term care insurance policy to help cover these costs. This can provide peace of mind and financial security in the event that you need ongoing care.

7. Plan for legacy giving: Many older adults from diverse backgrounds may want to leave a legacy gift to their community or favorite charity. Consider consulting with a financial advisor or estate planning attorney to ensure your wishes
