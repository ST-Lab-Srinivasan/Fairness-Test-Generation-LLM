Creating more inclusive community programs for physically able-bodied older adults (ages 90 and above) requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the needs of the older adults: Conduct research or consult with organizations that serve this age group to gain an understanding of their unique needs, interests, and challenges. This will help you design programs that cater to their physical, social, and emotional well-being.
2. Offer a variety of activities: Develop programs that provide a range of physical, cognitive, and social activities, such as exercise classes, art or music therapy, gardening, volunteering, or intergenerational programming with younger populations. This will help older adults stay engaged, active, and connected to their communities.
3. Adapt spaces and materials: Ensure that community spaces are accessible and comfortable for older adults, with adequate lighting, seating, and mobility aids. Also, provide materials and resources that are relevant and meaningful to this age group, such as large-print books or Braille materials.
4. Encourage intergenerational connections: Pair older adults with younger volunteers or participants for activities like mentorship, storytelling, or joint projects. This can help bridge the generation gap and foster mutual respect and understanding.
5. Involve older adults in program planning: Engage them in the process of designing and implementing community programs, by seeking their input and feedback. This will not only ensure that programs are tailored to their needs but also provide an opportunity for them to stay involved and feel valued.
6. Provide transportation options: Offer convenient and reliable transportation services to and from community programs, to make it easier for older adults to participate.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for socialization and connection among older adults, such as regular gatherings or events. This can help combat loneliness and isolation, which are common issues for this age group.
8. Offer flexible scheduling options: Accommodate the varying needs and abilities of older adults by offering programs at different times or days of the week. This will allow them to participate more easily and without feeling pressure to conform to a fixed schedule
