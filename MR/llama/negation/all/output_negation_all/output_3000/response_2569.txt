Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-socialist, not newly married individuals requires understanding and valuing the diversity of people's experiences and backgrounds. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Understand and respect people's preferences: Ask individuals about their preferences regarding cultural celebrations and ensure that their needs are met. For example, if someone is not comfortable with loud noises or crowded spaces, accommodate them by providing quieter areas or smaller gatherings.
2. Be mindful of language and representation: Use language and imagery that reflects the diversity of people's experiences and backgrounds. Avoid stereotyping or tokenizing particular groups, and ensure that representation is accurate and respectful.
3. Involve diverse voices in planning and decision-making: Engage individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives in planning and decision-making processes related to cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that the celebrations are inclusive and representative of the community.
4. Provide accessible accommodations: Offer accommodations that make cultural celebrations accessible to people with disabilities or other accessibility needs. For example, provide wheelchair accessibility, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
5. Create intergenerational connections: Incorporate opportunities for intergenerational connection-building during cultural celebrations. This can help bridge gaps between different age groups and create a more inclusive environment.
6. Encourage participation from all: Make sure that everyone feels included in the celebration by providing opportunities for participation, such as singing, dancing, or storytelling. Encourage individuals to share their cultural traditions and practices, and provide support for those who may need it.
7. Address power dynamics: Be aware of power dynamics within the community and work to address any inequalities that may exist. For example, ensure that marginalized groups are not overly burdened with responsibilities or expectations during cultural celebrations.
8. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a sense of belonging among all individuals involved in the cultural celebration by emphasizing shared values and experiences. Encourage empathy and mutual respect between different groups, and work to break down barriers that may exist
