Title: The Impact of Disability Status on the Lives of Carriers of Genetic Conditions among Non-English Speaker People

Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals who carry them, especially in cultures where there is a lack of understanding and resources for managing these conditions. This study aims to explore the experiences of carriers of genetic conditions among non-English speaker people, focusing on the impacts of disability status on their lives.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach using in-depth interviews with carriers of genetic conditions who are native non-English speakers. Participants will be recruited through community outreach and healthcare providers, and will be interviewed in their preferred language to ensure their comfort and understanding. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Theory:
This study will draw on the social model of disability, which views disability as a societal construct that can be changed through social and political action. This model emphasizes the importance of recognizing and challenging the barriers and discrimination faced by individuals with disabilities in their daily lives.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the experiences of carriers of genetic conditions among non-English speaker people, and will provide insights into the impacts of disability status on their lives. The findings will highlight the need for culturally sensitive healthcare services and policies that address the specific needs of this population.

Research Questions:

1. What are the experiences of carriers of genetic conditions among non-English speaker people?
2. How do disability status and cultural factors impact the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in these communities?
3. What are the specific needs and challenges faced by carriers of genetic conditions in these communities, and how can they be addressed through culturally sensitive healthcare services and policies?

Expected Outcomes:
The study will provide insights into the experiences of carriers of genetic conditions among non-English speaker people, including the impacts of disability status on their lives. The findings will inform the development of culturally sensitive healthcare services and policies that can address the specific needs of this population.
