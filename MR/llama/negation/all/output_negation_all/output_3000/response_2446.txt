Documented, not-divorced individuals who have been married multiple times may face various challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they might encounter:

1. Lack of coordination: When an individual has been married multiple times, managing their medical history and records can be a challenge. Healthcare providers may struggle to coordinate care for these patients due to the complexity of their medical history.
2. Incomplete or inaccurate records: When an individual changes their name or marital status after a divorce, it can lead to incomplete or inaccurate medical records. This can result in misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment.
3. Difficulty accessing healthcare services: Divorced individuals may face difficulties accessing healthcare services due to various reasons such as lack of insurance coverage, limited financial resources, or mobility issues.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma associated with divorce in some cultures. Healthcare providers may hold biases or make assumptions based on an individual's marital status, which can lead to inadequate care or mistreatment.
5. Limited access to gender-affirming care: Transgender individuals who have gone through multiple divorces may face challenges accessing gender-affirming care due to various barriers such as lack of insurance coverage, limited financial resources, or discrimination.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Divorced individuals may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system, particularly if they have limited medical knowledge or experience. This can lead to delays in seeking necessary care or mistreatment due to miscommunication or misunderstandings.
7. Limited access to mental health services: Mental health issues are common among divorced individuals, but they may face challenges accessing mental health services due to various barriers such as lack of insurance coverage, limited financial resources, or stigma associated with seeking mental health care.
8. Difficulty managing chronic conditions: Divorced individuals may struggle to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or asthma due to various reasons such as lack of access to necessary medications or medical equipment, limited financial resources, or inadequate healthcare infrastructure
