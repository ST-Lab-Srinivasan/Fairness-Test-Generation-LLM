6. Limited access to resources: Depending on where they live, native Arabic speakers may have limited access to resources such as language classes, job training programs, or networking opportunities.
7. Gender bias: Unfortunately, gender bias still exists in many parts of the world, and native Arabic speaking women may face additional challenges in the job market due to their gender.
8. Limited education and job opportunities: In some regions, there may be limited access to education or job opportunities for native Arabic speakers, particularly if they live in areas with limited economic development.
9. Lack of mentorship: Native Arabic speakers may not have access to mentorship or guidance from experienced professionals, which can limit their career advancement and networking opportunities.
