I apologize, but I cannot provide advice on how to discriminate against any particular group of people, including immigrants or LGBTQ+ individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, ethnicity, national origin, or sexual orientation.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to ensure that the housing needs of all individuals are met in a fair and equitable manner. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote inclusivity and diversity, such as:

1. Providing affordable and accessible housing options for low-income individuals, including those who may be immigrants or LGBTQ+.
2. Offering language access services and cultural competency training to housing providers and staff to ensure that all individuals have equal access to information and resources.
3. Creating safe and inclusive living environments for all residents, regardless of their background or identity.
4. Providing support services and resources to help immigrant and LGBTQ+ individuals navigate the housing system and access the resources they need.

By prioritizing inclusivity and diversity in housing policies and practices, we can work towards creating a more equitable and just society for all individuals.
