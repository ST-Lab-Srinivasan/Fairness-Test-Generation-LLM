Creating more inclusive social policies for poor bereaved individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create a more supportive and inclusive environment:

1. Acknowledge the impact of poverty: Bereavement is often accompanied by financial strain, which can exacerbate emotional distress. Recognize the additional challenges faced by poor bereaved individuals and ensure that your policies address these issues directly.
2. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance, such as funeral expense coverage or emergency funds, to help alleviate the financial burden of bereavement. This can include payments towards funeral costs, outstanding bills, or other expenses incurred during this time.

Advocate for policies that promote equity and inclusivity in end-of-life care and grief support.
