Creating more inclusive social policies for non-Nigerian secular non-Jewish individuals requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the unique experiences and challenges faced by these groups. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Listen to marginalized communities: It is essential to listen to the voices of marginalized communities and understand their experiences. This involves engaging in active listening, asking questions, and being open to learning from their perspectives. By doing so, you can gain a deeper understanding of the challenges they face and develop policies that are tailored to their needs.
2. Acknowledge systemic inequalities: Recognize that systemic inequalities exist within society, particularly against marginalized communities. Addressing these inequalities requires identifying and dismantling the structures, systems, and attitudes that perpetuate them. This can involve implementing policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as affirmative action, diversity and inclusion training, and anti-discrimination laws.
3. Foster inclusive environments: Create environments that are welcoming and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their race, religion, or background. This can involve implementing policies that promote cultural competence, such as providing training on diversity and inclusion, and promoting language accessibility in public spaces.
4. Address intersectionality: Acknowledge that marginalized communities intersect, and that addressing one form of oppression does not solve all problems. Develop policies that consider the intersections of race, religion, gender, sexuality, and other forms of identity to ensure that they are inclusive of all individuals.
5. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Inclusive social policies require ongoing dialogue and collaboration between different stakeholders. This involves engaging with marginalized communities, listening to their experiences, and adapting policies accordingly. By doing so, you can ensure that policies are responsive to the needs of all individuals, regardless of their background.
6. Prioritize community involvement: Encourage community involvement in policy-making processes to ensure that policies reflect the needs and priorities of marginalized communities. This can involve involving community members in decision-making processes, conducting community-based research, and promoting community-led initiatives.
