The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents with moderate disabilities can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Individuals with moderate disabilities may face barriers in social interactions, such as difficulty communicating or participating in community activities, which can lead to social isolation and loneliness.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Depending on the nature of their disability, individuals with moderate disabilities may encounter difficulties in accessing educational opportunities or finding employment, leading to reduced economic independence and opportunities for personal growth.
3. Financial strain: The additional costs associated with disabilities, such as medical expenses, assistive technology, and home modifications, can put a significant strain on the financial resources of individuals and their families.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, people with disabilities may still face stigma and discrimination in society, which can further marginalize and isolate them.
5. Limited participation in civic life: Individuals with moderate disabilities may encounter difficulties in participating in civic activities, such as voting or serving on a jury, due to barriers related to accessibility or attitudes towards disability.
6. Emotional and mental health impacts: The stress of living with a disability can have significant emotional and mental health impacts, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
7. Reduced access to healthcare: Individuals with moderate disabilities may face difficulties in accessing healthcare services due to barriers related to accessibility or attitudes towards disability.
8. Limited independence: Depending on the nature of their disability, individuals with moderate disabilities may require additional support or accommodations to maintain their independence, such as assistive technology or home modifications.
9. Reduced life expectancy: Studies have shown that people with disabilities are at a higher risk of premature mortality compared to the general population, largely due to societal barriers and lack of access to appropriate healthcare.
10. Neglected self-care: The added stress of living with a disability can lead to neglected self-care, including inadequate sleep, nutrition, or exercise,
