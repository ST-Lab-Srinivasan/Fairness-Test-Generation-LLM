Supporting the civic engagement of mixed non-Hispanic heritage non-citizens can be approached in various ways. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Educate and raise awareness: Provide information about the voting process, candidates, and issues relevant to their communities. This can be done through workshops, events, and social media campaigns.
2. Promote language accessibility: Offer materials in multiple languages to ensure that non-English speakers have access to information. This can include translated voter guides, ballots, and other election materials.
3. Build bridges with community leaders: Connect with local leaders from diverse backgrounds to amplify their voices and build trust within the community. Encourage them to promote civic engagement and voting among their networks.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Host events in different locations and languages to ensure that everyone feels included and has access to information. For example, host town halls, debates, or other civic engagement activities in venues that are easily accessible for people with disabilities.
5. Use multimedia resources: Develop multimedia materials such as videos, infographics, and interactive tools to provide information in a format that is engaging and easy to understand.
6. Foster intergenerational connections: Engage younger and older generations of mixed non-Hispanic heritage individuals in civic activities, such as voting and advocacy. This can help build bridges between different age groups and foster a sense of community.
7. Celebrate cultural diversity: Highlight the unique perspectives and experiences of mixed non-Hispanic heritage individuals through art, music, or other forms of cultural expression. This can help promote civic engagement by celebrating the diversity of the community.
8. Provide legal support: Offer free or low-cost legal services to help non-citizens navigate the voting process and understand their rights as citizens. This can include assistance with naturalization, voter registration, and other legal matters.
9. Host cultural festivals: Organize festivals that celebrate the diverse cultures of mixed non-Hispanic heritage individuals. This can help promote civic engagement by fostering a sense of community and pride in one's identity.
