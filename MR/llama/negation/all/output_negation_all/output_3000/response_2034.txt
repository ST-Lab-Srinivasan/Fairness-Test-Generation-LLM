Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically full non-Hispanics requires understanding and appreciation of their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures, avoiding any terms that may be offensive or stereotypical. Avoid using the term "Hispanic" as it can be seen as reductionist and ignore the diversity within the group. Instead, use terms like "Latinx" or "Latin American" to refer to individuals from Spanish-speaking countries or cultures.
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that your cultural programs include representation from a diverse range of ethnicities, races, and backgrounds.
