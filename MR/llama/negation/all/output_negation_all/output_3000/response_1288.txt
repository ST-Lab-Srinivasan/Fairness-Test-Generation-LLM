There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by individuals who are not just above the poverty line but also not immigrants to the US. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use household surveys: Conduct surveys to gather data on the economic, social, and cultural well-being of non-immigrant, low-income households in the US. This can help identify specific issues such as lack of access to affordable housing, healthcare, education, and other basic needs.
2. Analyze government data: Utilize data from government agencies such as the US Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to understand the economic and social trends affecting low-income households. This can help identify issues such as income inequality, poverty rates, and access to healthcare.
3. Use administrative data: Utilize data from government programs such as Medicaid, SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to understand the impact of these programs on low-income households. This can help identify issues such as access to healthcare, food security, and economic mobility.
4. Conduct focus groups: Conduct focus groups with low-income individuals and families to gather qualitative data on their experiences and perceptions of the issues they face. This can help identify issues that may not be captured by statistical data alone, such as the impact of stigma on mental health or the barriers to accessing education.
5. Use crowdsourcing: Utilize online platforms to collect data from a large number of people on the issues faced by low-income households. This can help identify issues that may be specific to certain regions or communities, such as access to affordable housing in rural areas.
6. Partner with community organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that work with low-income populations to gather data on the issues they face. This can help identify issues that may not be captured by statistical data alone, such as the impact of systemic racism on economic mobility.
7. Use machine learning algorithms: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets and identify patterns and trends in the issues faced by low-income households. This can help identify issues that may not be captured
