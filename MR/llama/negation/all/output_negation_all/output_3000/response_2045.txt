Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speaker Native American natural-born US citizens requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and awareness for program organizers, teachers, and volunteers. This will help them understand the unique needs and experiences of Native American communities and tailor programs accordingly.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language and terminology when referring to Native American cultures and languages. Avoid using stereotypical or offensive terms that can alienate participants.
3. Community engagement: Engage with local Native American communities and involve them in the program development process. This will help ensure that programs are culturally relevant and responsive to community needs.
4. Collaboration with Native American organizations: Partner with Native American organizations and cultural centers to provide cultural programs. These partnerships can help leverage resources, expertise, and community connections.
5. Focus on language preservation: Many Native American languages are endangered, and language loss can have significant cultural and social implications. Consider incorporating language preservation activities into cultural programs, such as language classes, language exchange events, or cultural storytelling workshops.
6. Incorporate traditional knowledge: Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices into cultural programs, such as traditional medicine, agriculture, or craft-making. This can help participants connect with their cultural heritage and build a sense of identity and belonging.
7. Provide mentorship opportunities: Offer mentorship opportunities for beginner Chinese speakers to learn from native speakers and gain exposure to authentic language use and cultural practices.
8. Create a supportive learning environment: Ensure that program settings are welcoming and inclusive, providing beginners with the opportunity to practice their language skills in a comfortable and supportive atmosphere.
9. Celebrate cultural diversity: Incorporate cultural events and activities that celebrate Native American diversity, such as traditional dance, music, or art exhibitions. This can help promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation among program participants.
10. Continuous evaluation and improvement: Regularly evaluate and assess the effectiveness of cultural programs in promoting language acquisition and cultural understanding. Use this information to
