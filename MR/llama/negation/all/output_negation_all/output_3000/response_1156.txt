Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are not immigrants and natural-born US citizens requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make these programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms like "native" or "immigrant," which can be perceived as exclusive. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of cultural backgrounds, such as "beginner Chinese speakers from diverse backgrounds."
