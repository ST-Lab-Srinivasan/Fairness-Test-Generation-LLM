As a non-native English speaker and not a libertarian, there are several challenges that you may face in the job market. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Language barrier: If you are not fluent in English, it can be difficult to communicate effectively with colleagues, clients, and customers. This can limit your opportunities for advancement and make it harder to perform your job duties.
2. Cultural differences: Non-native English speakers may face cultural differences in the workplace, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, gestures or expressions that are common in one culture may be misunderstood or offensive in another.
3. Stereotyping and bias: Unfortunately, non-native English speakers may face stereotypes and biases from employers and colleagues. These can include assumptions about their language skills or cultural background, which can limit their opportunities for advancement.
4. Difficulty navigating the job market: Non-native English speakers may struggle to navigate the job market, especially if they are not familiar with the culture and customs of the country they are working in. This can make it harder to find a job that is a good fit for them.
5. Limited access to resources: Non-native English speakers may have limited access to resources such as training programs, networking opportunities, or career advancement opportunities. This can limit their ability to develop their skills and advance in their careers.
6. Difficulty with remote work: If you are a non-native English speaker working remotely, you may face challenges such as language barriers, cultural differences, and time zone differences. These can make it harder to communicate effectively with colleagues and clients, which can impact your productivity and job satisfaction.
7. Limited job opportunities: Non-native English speakers may face limited job opportunities due to a lack of English language skills or cultural knowledge. This can limit their ability to find a job that is a good fit for them.
8. Difficulty with work-life balance: Non-native English speakers may face challenges with work-life balance, especially if they are working long hours to keep up with the demands of their job. This can impact their mental and physical health, which can affect their productivity and job satisfaction.
