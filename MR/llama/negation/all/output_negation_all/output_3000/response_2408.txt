Non-not middle-class mixed non-Asian heritage people in the healthcare system may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Cultural barriers: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with or respectful of the individual's cultural practices and beliefs, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
2. Language barriers: Depending on the individual's language proficiency and the availability of interpreters, they may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background can still occur in the healthcare system. This can lead to feelings of mistrust and unease when seeking care.
4. Lack of representation: Non-Asian mixed heritage individuals may feel underrepresented or invisible within the healthcare system, leading to a lack of understanding or empathy for their unique experiences and needs.
5. Internalized oppression: Growing up in a society that often marginalizes or devalues certain aspects of one's identity can lead to internalized oppression, where individuals may feel ashamed or embarrassed about their cultural background or identity.
6. Health disparities: Non-Asian mixed heritage individuals may face health disparities due to systemic inequalities in access to healthcare, nutrition, and other factors that affect health outcomes.
7. Stigma and shame: Depending on the individual's cultural background and experiences, they may face stigma or shame related to their identity, which can impact their mental health and well-being.
8. Lack of role models or support: A lack of representation and visibility of non-Asian mixed heritage individuals in the healthcare system can make it difficult for young people to see themselves in these roles and feel supported in their career aspirations.
9. Microaggressions: Non-Asian mixed heritage individuals may face microaggressions, or subtle, often unintentional behaviors or comments that can be demeaning or invalidating.
10. Tokenization: Depending on the individual's cultural background and experiences, they may face tokenization, or being reduced to a single aspect of their identity, rather than being seen as a complex and multifaceted person.
