Creating more inclusive community events for native Chinese speaker upper not middle-class people requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the target audience: Before organizing any event, it's essential to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather information about their interests, preferences, and cultural values. This will help you tailor the event to meet their needs and expectations.
2. Offer a variety of activities: Design the event to cater to different interests and age groups. For example, include cultural performances, workshops, and games that are relevant to the target audience. This will help keep them engaged and entertained throughout the event.
3. Provide accessible and affordable food options: Offer a variety of food options that cater to the dietary preferences and budget constraints of the target audience. Consider offering vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options, as well as affordable price points.
4. Promote the event through social media and local channels: Utilize social media platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and Douyin to promote the event. Create eye-catching graphics and videos that highlight the unique aspects of the event. Also, partner with local community organizations and influencers to help spread the word.
5. Incorporate cultural elements: Incorporate elements of Chinese culture into the event, such as traditional music, dance, or art. This will help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity among the attendees.
6. Offer language support: Provide interpretation or translation services during the event to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the content. This is particularly important for native Chinese speakers who may not be fluent in English or other languages spoken at the event.
7. Create a safe and inclusive space: Ensure that the event venue is accessible and comfortable for all attendees. Provide gender-neutral bathrooms and make sure that the space is free from discrimination and harassment.
8. Involve local artists and performers: Collaborate with local artists and performers to create a unique and engaging event. This will help support the local community and provide opportunities for emerging talent.
9. Offer educational work
