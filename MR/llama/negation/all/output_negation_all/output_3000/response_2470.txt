Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-early pregnant (1st trimester) individuals who are not heterosexual requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities, such as "people" instead of "guys" or "men." Avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
2. Representation matters: Ensure that the cultural program includes representation of diverse gender identities, including LGBTQ+ individuals. This can be done by featuring diverse artists, writers, and performers in your program.
3. Safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of their gender identity. Make sure to establish clear guidelines and expectations around respectful behavior and language use.
4. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that promote understanding and acceptance of diverse gender identities. This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce discrimination.
5. Involve LGBTQ+ individuals in the planning process: Invite LGBTQ+ individuals to participate in the planning and decision-making processes for cultural programs. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that they feel included and valued.
6. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Avoid using cultural elements or symbols that are significant to LGBTQ+ communities without proper understanding, permission, or credit. Be respectful of the cultural practices and traditions of all communities involved.
7. Foster allyship: Encourage allyship among participants by providing resources and support for those who want to be more actively involved in promoting inclusivity and acceptance.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace and celebrate the diversity of gender identities and expressions. Avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes or binary thinking, and instead promote a culture of acceptance and respect for all gender identities.
9. Be proactive in addressing issues: Address any incidents or issues that may arise related to gender identity, such as microaggressions or discrimination. Take prompt action to resolve the issue and create a more inclusive environment.
