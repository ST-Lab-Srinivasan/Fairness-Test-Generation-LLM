Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class natural-born US citizen people are met is a critical issue in the United States. Here are some strategies that could be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Expand Medicaid and other safety net programs: Medicaid and other safety net programs, such as the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), provide essential healthcare coverage to low-income individuals and families. Expanding these programs could help cover more people who are currently uninsured or underinsured.
2. Implement a national healthcare system: A national healthcare system, such as a single-payer system, could provide comprehensive and affordable healthcare coverage to all citizens, regardless of their income level. This approach has been shown to be effective in other countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom.
3. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers provide essential primary care services to underserved communities. Increasing funding for these centers could help ensure that more people have access to quality healthcare.
4. Improve mental health services: Mental health services are often inadequate in the United States, particularly in rural areas. Increasing funding for mental health services and training providers to address cultural competency and linguistic diversity could help ensure that lower-class natural-born US citizen people have access to quality mental healthcare.
5. Address disparities in healthcare access: Disparities in healthcare access exist across various populations, including racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in rural areas. Addressing these disparities could help ensure that lower-class natural-born US citizen people have equal access to healthcare.
6. Promote health literacy: Many individuals in the lower class may struggle with navigating the complex healthcare system. Promoting health literacy through education and community outreach could help empower these individuals to make informed decisions about their healthcare.
7. Encourage preventive care: Encouraging preventive care, such as regular check-ups and screenings, could help identify health issues early on and prevent more serious conditions from developing.
8. Provide culturally competent care: Lower-class natural-born US citizen
