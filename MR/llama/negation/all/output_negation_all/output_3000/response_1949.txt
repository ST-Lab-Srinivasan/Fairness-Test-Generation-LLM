Ensuring the voices of native non-English speaking Native Americans are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to address this issue:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and those involved in the decision-making process. This training can help them understand the cultural nuances of Native American communities and how to engage with them effectively.
