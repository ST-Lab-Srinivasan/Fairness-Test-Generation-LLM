Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Non-Liberal US Citizens

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-liberal US citizens, including those who are not immigrants. This essay will explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how it relates to their political beliefs.

I. Defining Cultural Heritage

Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, customs, traditions, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society. It encompasses the history, language, religion, art, music, and other cultural expressions of a community (Bhattacharya, 2017). For non-liberal US citizens, their cultural heritage may include traditional gender roles, social hierarchies, and religious beliefs that shape their understanding of identity and belonging.

II. The Impact of Cultural Heritage on Identity

A. Shared Values and Beliefs

Cultural heritage shapes the identities of non-liberal US citizens by providing a framework for understanding themselves and their place in society. It influences their beliefs, values, and attitudes towards politics, social issues, and cultural norms (Kim, 2016). For example, a person from a traditional African American community may identify strongly with the cultural values of their community, such as respect for elders, strong family bonds, and a sense of belonging within their own racial and ethnic group. These values can shape their political beliefs and actions, influencing how they view themselves in relation to the wider society.

B. Social Hierarchies and Power Dynamics

Cultural heritage also plays a role in shaping power dynamics and social hierarchies within communities (Mufson, 2018). For example, a person from a community with a history of systemic oppression may feel a sense of resentment towards those in positions of authority who they perceive as having benefited from that oppression. This resentment can manifest politically through resistance or rebellion against the status quo (Hall, 2017).
