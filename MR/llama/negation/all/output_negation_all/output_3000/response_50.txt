Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who identify as equally not bisexual non-not a socialist. Here are some ways cultural heritage can influence identity formation:

1. Shared values and beliefs: Cultural heritage encompasses a set of shared values, beliefs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next. These shared cultural elements can shape an individual's sense of self and their place within a particular community or society. For example, if an individual grows up in a culture that values hard work and self-reliance, they may internalize these values and adopt them as their own identity.
2. Cultural expression: Cultural heritage provides individuals with a framework for expressing themselves through art, music, literature, and other forms of creative expression. For instance, an individual who grows up in a culture that places a high value on poetry may be more likely to identify as a poet or writer, rather than any other profession.
3. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals form their identities, including their gender identity, sexual orientation, and political beliefs. For example, an individual who grows up in a culture that values gender equality may be more likely to identify as non-binary or genderqueer, while someone from a culture that emphasizes traditional gender roles may be more likely to identify as male or female.
4. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can create a sense of belonging and connection to a particular group or community. For instance, an individual who grows up in a cultural context that values family and community ties may feel a strong sense of belonging to their immediate and extended family, which can shape their identity.
5. Intersectionality: It's important to recognize that cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of an individual's identity, such as race, ethnicity, class, and disability. For example, an individual who identifies as both bisexual and a person of color may experience unique challenges and opportunities in their identity formation due to these intersections.
