Supporting not independent beginner French speaker communities can be a challenging task, but there are several effective strategies that can help. Here are some ideas:

This could be through language exchange events, conversation clubs, or online forums where learners can share their progress and get feedback from more advanced speakers.
2. Provide opportunities for interaction: Organize events or activities that allow beginners to interact with more advanced speakers in a relaxed setting.
