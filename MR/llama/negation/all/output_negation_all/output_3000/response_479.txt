Ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-middle-class, non-immigrant populations in the United States are met is crucial for promoting equity and improving overall public health. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Expand Medicaid eligibility: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for low-income individuals is lack of insurance coverage. Expanding Medicaid eligibility to include more populations, such as those with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level, can help bridge this gap.
2. Improve community health centers: Community health centers (CHCs) are an important source of primary care for underserved communities. Investing in CHCs and providing them with additional resources, such as telemedicine services and mobile clinics, can help increase access to care for these populations.
3. Support nurse practitioner programs: Nurse practitioners (NPs) are advanced practice registered nurses who provide primary and specialty care. Investing in NP training programs and providing them with more autonomy to prescribe medications and order tests can help increase access to care for underserved populations.
4. Address social determinants of health: Many health disparities are rooted in social determinants such as poverty, housing instability, and food insecurity. Addressing these factors through policies that promote affordable housing, food security, and economic mobility can help improve overall health outcomes for underserved populations.
5. Promote cultural competency in healthcare: Healthcare providers must be aware of the cultural and linguistic needs of their patients to provide appropriate care. Providing cultural competency training for healthcare providers and ensuring that language access services are available can help improve health outcomes for underserved populations.
6. Increase funding for minority health initiatives: Many organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provide funding for minority health initiatives. Increasing funding for these programs can help support research and interventions aimed at reducing health disparities among underserved populations.
7. Improve data collection and analysis: Collecting and analyzing data on health outcomes, healthcare access, and social determinants of health
