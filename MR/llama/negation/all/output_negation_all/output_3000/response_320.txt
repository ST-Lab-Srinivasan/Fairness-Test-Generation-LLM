Promoting the educational success of formerly newely not married gender-nonconforming students requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that educators, administrators, and supportive adults can use to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment:

1. Create a safe and welcoming space: Ensure that the school or learning environment is free from discrimination and harassment based on gender identity or expression. Provide students with a safe space to express themselves without fear of judgment or bullying.
2. Use inclusive language and materials: Use language and materials that are inclusive of all genders and avoid binary language that reinforces gender stereotypes. For example, use "students" instead of "boys" or "girls."
3. Provide gender-neutral bathrooms and facilities: Ensure that there are gender-neutral bathrooms and facilities available for students who may not identify with traditional gender categories.
4. Offer gender-inclusive extracurricular activities: Encourage students to participate in extracurricular activities that are inclusive of all genders, such as sports teams, clubs, and organizations.
5. Train educators on gender diversity: Provide training for educators on understanding and supporting gender-nonconforming students. This can include information on gender identity, expression, and the challenges faced by these students.
6. Encourage student participation: Encourage students to participate in decision-making processes and events that affect their lives. This can help them feel more engaged and invested in their education.
7. Provide mental health support: Gender-nonconforming students may face higher rates of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues due to discrimination and marginalization. Ensure that there are mental health resources available for these students.
8. Celebrate gender diversity: Celebrate and recognize the diversity of gender identities in your school or learning environment. Host events or activities that promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity.
9. Collaborate with supportive organizations: Partner with organizations that provide support and resources for gender-nonconforming students, such as LGBTQ+ youth centers or advocacy groups.
