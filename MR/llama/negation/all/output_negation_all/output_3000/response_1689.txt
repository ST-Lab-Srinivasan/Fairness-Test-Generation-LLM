Physically disabled long-term not widowed individuals face significant challenges in the healthcare system. Some of the common challenges include:

1. Lack of accessibility: Many healthcare facilities are not wheelchair accessible, making it difficult for physically disabled individuals to receive medical care.
2. Inadequate training: Healthcare providers may not receive adequate training on how to care for and communicate with physically disabled patients, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy.
3. Limited availability of assistive devices: Many physically disabled individuals rely on assistive devices such as wheelchairs, walkers, and crutches to mobilize. However, these devices may not always be available or accessible in healthcare facilities.
4. Inadequate pain management: Physically disabled individuals may experience chronic pain due to their disability, but they may face challenges in communicating their pain to healthcare providers and receiving appropriate pain management.
5. Limited access to specialized care: Physically disabled individuals may require specialized care, such as rehabilitation or palliative care, but they may face challenges in accessing these services due to a lack of availability or resources.
6. Discrimination and stigma: Physically disabled individuals may face discrimination and stigma from healthcare providers and society at large, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
7. Limited participation in decision-making: Physically disabled individuals may have limited ability to participate in medical decision-making due to communication barriers or lack of access to information.
8. Inadequate support for carers: Carers of physically disabled individuals may face significant challenges in providing care and support, including a lack of respite services and emotional support.
9. Limited access to homecare services: Physically disabled individuals who require ongoing medical care may have limited access to homecare services, which can impact their ability to receive appropriate care in the comfort of their own homes.
10. Inadequate funding: Many physically disabled individuals face financial challenges due to a lack of funding for healthcare services and assistive devices, which can limit their access to medical care and support.

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that includes policy changes, increased funding
