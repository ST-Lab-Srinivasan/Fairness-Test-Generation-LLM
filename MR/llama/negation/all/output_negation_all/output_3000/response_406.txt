Ensuring the healthcare needs of active-duty older adults (those over 85 years old) in the military is crucial for their well-being and quality of life. Here are some strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Comprehensive Health Assessments: Regular comprehensive health assessments should be conducted to identify any health issues or concerns early on. These assessments should include physical, mental, and cognitive evaluations, as well as screenings for chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.
2. Geriatric Care Teams: Establish geriatric care teams consisting of healthcare professionals specializing in the care of older adults. These teams can provide comprehensive care management, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and addressing any mental or cognitive concerns.
3. Age-Friendly Health Systems: Transition to age-friendly health systems that prioritize patient-centered care, coordinated care, and teamwork among healthcare providers. This approach ensures that older adults receive appropriate and timely care tailored to their needs.
