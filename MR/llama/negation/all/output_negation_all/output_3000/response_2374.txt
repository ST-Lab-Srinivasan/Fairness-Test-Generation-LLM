There are several ways to support the economic empowerment of employed non-immigrant individuals in the US:

1. Access to affordable financial services: Many employed individuals may struggle to access affordable financial services such as bank accounts, loans, and credit cards. Financial technology companies can help bridge this gap by providing accessible and affordable financial services.
2. Investing in education and skills training: Employed individuals can benefit from investments in education and skills training to enhance their job prospects and career advancement opportunities. This can include vocational training, certification programs, and degree-granting courses.
3. Support for entrepreneurship: Encouraging entrepreneurship can help employed individuals create new businesses and jobs, which can have a positive impact on the economy. Governments and organizations can provide resources such as funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities to support entrepreneurs.
4. Job training programs: Job training programs can help employed individuals acquire new skills and adapt to changing job market demands. These programs can be tailored to specific industries or sectors, such as technology, healthcare, or manufacturing.
5. Advocating for fair compensation practices: Employed individuals may face challenges related to unequal pay, lack of benefits, or limited career advancement opportunities. Advocating for fair compensation practices can help address these issues and promote greater economic equality.
6. Encouraging diversity and inclusion in the workplace: Workplaces that prioritize diversity and inclusion can create a more equitable and productive environment, leading to better outcomes for employed individuals. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.
7. Supporting gig economy workers: The gig economy has grown significantly in recent years, and many workers are now classified as independent contractors rather than traditional employees. Governments and organizations can support these workers by providing access to benefits, legal protections, and resources for career development.
8. Fostering work-life balance: Many employed individuals face challenges related to work-life balance, such as long hours, lack of paid leave, or poor job security. Encouraging employers to prioritize work-life balance can help promote greater economic well-being and quality of life
