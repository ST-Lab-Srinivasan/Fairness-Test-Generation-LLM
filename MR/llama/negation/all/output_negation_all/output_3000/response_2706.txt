1. Discrimination: Working-class individuals may face discrimination based on their social class, including being overlooked for promotions or other opportunities due to unconscious biases held by employers.
2. Lack of access to networks and resources: Progressive working-class individuals may not have access to the same professional networks and resources as their more affluent counterparts, making it harder to find job opportunities or advance in their careers.
3. Limited education and training opportunities: Some working-class individuals may face barriers to accessing quality education and training programs, which can limit their career advancement possibilities.
4. Workplace discrimination and harassment: Working-class individuals may be more vulnerable to workplace discrimination and harassment due to their social class, leading to a less than fulfilling work experience.

6. Low wages: Working-class individuals may face lower pay rates compared to their counterparts from more affluent backgrounds, which can limit their earning potential and create financial instability.
7. Lack of benefits: Some working-class jobs may not provide the same benefits as those offered to employees in more affluent positions, such as health insurance, retirement plans, or paid time off.
8. Limited career progression opportunities: Working-class individuals may have limited opportunities for career advancement due to a lack of access to training and development programs, or due to the limitations placed on their job roles.
