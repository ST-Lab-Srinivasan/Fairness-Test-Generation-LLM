Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner Spanish speakers who are not independent individuals. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences their language learning journey:

1. Family Ties: Many beginner Spanish speakers are learning the language because of their family ties to Spanish-speaking countries or cultures. They may have parents, grandparents, or other relatives who speak Spanish as their first language, and they want to be able to communicate with them more effectively. Cultural heritage can help learners connect with their family history and cultural identity, which can motivate them to continue learning the language.
2. Traditions and Customs: Understanding cultural heritage can help beginner Spanish speakers navigate traditional events and celebrations in Spanish-speaking communities. For example, they may want to participate in festivals like Dia de los Muertos or Cinco de Mayo, but they need to know what to expect and how to behave appropriately. By learning about cultural heritage, learners can gain a deeper appreciation for the language and culture they are studying.
3. Identity Formation: Beginner Spanish speakers who are not independent may struggle with their identity as they learn a new language and culture. Cultural heritage can help them understand how their own identity intersects with the language and culture they are learning. For example, they may discover that their own cultural practices and beliefs have similarities with those of the Spanish-speaking world, which can help them feel more connected to the language and culture.
4. Community Building: Cultural heritage can also play a role in building a sense of community among beginner Spanish speakers who are not independent. By learning about shared cultural practices and traditions, learners can connect with one another and form a sense of belonging. This can be especially important for those who may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers due to language barriers or other factors.
5. Personal Fulfillment: Finally, cultural heritage can contribute to the personal fulfillment of beginner Spanish speakers who are not independent. By learning about the rich cultural traditions and practices of Spanish-speaking communities, learners can gain a deeper appreciation for the language and culture they are studying. This can lead to a more enjoyable and rewarding language learning experience, as well as a greater sense of accomplishment when they are able to communicate effectively
