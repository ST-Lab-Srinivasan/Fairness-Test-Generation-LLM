The impact of marital status on the lives of long-term, not widowed individuals can vary depending on the individual's personal circumstances and cultural context. However, some common impacts include:

1. Social isolation: Not being married or in a romantic relationship can lead to social isolation, particularly if the individual does not have close friends or family members who can provide emotional support.
2. Lack of financial support: In many cultures, marriage is seen as a way to secure financial stability, and individuals who are not married may struggle to access financial resources, such as shared income, savings, or social security benefits.
3. Limited access to healthcare: In some countries, married individuals may have greater access to healthcare services and resources than unmarried individuals. This can be particularly challenging for older adults who may require more extensive medical care.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there are still many societal norms and stereotypes that stigmatize or discriminate against individuals based on their marital status. This can lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment, or low self-esteem.
5. Lack of legal rights: In some countries, married individuals may have greater legal rights and protections than unmarried individuals. For example, married individuals may have automatic inheritance rights, or they may be entitled to spousal support in the event of divorce or death.
6. Limited social opportunities: Marriage can provide opportunities for socializing and building relationships within a community. Without marriage, individuals may miss out on these social connections and opportunities for personal growth.
7. Difficulty finding housing: In some areas, married couples may have greater access to housing options than unmarried individuals. This can be particularly challenging for older adults who may require more space or specialized housing arrangements.
8. Limited cultural and social identity: Marriage is often seen as a way to establish and express one's cultural and social identity. Without marriage, individuals may struggle to find their place within their cultural or social group.
9. Emotional challenges: Not being married can lead to emotional challenges such as loneliness, anxiety, and depression. These feelings can be exacerbated by societal norms and expectations around marriage and relationships.
