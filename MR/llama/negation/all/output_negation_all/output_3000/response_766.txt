Genderfluid individuals, including those who have served in the military, may face a range of challenges within the legal system. Here are some potential issues that genderfluid ex-military people may encounter:

1. Lack of recognition and understanding: Many legal systems still rely on binary gender categories (male/female) and may not have provisions for individuals who identify as non-binary or genderfluid. This can lead to confusion, misunderstandings, and discrimination.
2. Barriers to identity documentation: Genderfluid individuals may face difficulties obtaining identification documents (such as passports, driver's licenses) that accurately reflect their gender identity. This can limit their ability to access legal rights and services.
3. Discrimination in military service: Historically, many militaries have had policies that exclude or discriminate against individuals based on their gender identity. This can lead to difficulties for genderfluid ex-military personnel in accessing veterans' benefits and other forms of support.
4. Limited access to healthcare: Genderfluid individuals may face challenges accessing medical care that aligns with their gender identity, particularly if they are living in areas with limited availability or cultural attitudes that do not recognize non-binary identities.
5. Legal barriers to marriage and family planning: In some jurisdictions, genderfluid individuals may face legal barriers to marrying a person of the same gender or accessing reproductive healthcare services such as IVF.
6. Employment discrimination: Genderfluid individuals may encounter discrimination in the workplace, including harassment and unequal treatment based on their gender identity.
7. Housing insecurity: Genderfluid individuals may face difficulties securing safe and affordable housing, particularly if they are living in areas with limited availability or cultural attitudes that do not recognize non-binary identities.
8. Social isolation: Genderfluid individuals may experience social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or a lack of supportive communities and resources.
9. Mental health impacts: The stress and trauma of facing legal barriers and social marginalization can have significant mental health impacts on genderfluid individuals, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD.
