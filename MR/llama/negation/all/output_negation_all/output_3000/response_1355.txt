Native Spanish speakers with mixed non-Asian heritage face a variety of challenges in the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system can be unfamiliar and intimidating to individuals who are not fluent in English or do not have a strong understanding of American culture. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and mistranslation, which can negatively impact the outcome of legal proceedings.
2. Racial and ethnic bias: Mixed-heritage individuals may face racial and ethnic bias in the legal system, particularly if they do not "look" or "sound" like they are from a particular cultural or racial group. This can lead to stereotyping and discrimination, which can impact the outcome of legal proceedings.
3. Identity issues: Mixed-heritage individuals may struggle with their identity and sense of belonging, particularly if they do not feel fully accepted by any one culture or community. This can impact their ability to navigate the legal system and advocate for themselves.
4. Lack of representation: Mixed-heritage individuals may face barriers when seeking legal representation, particularly if their cultural background is not well-represented in the legal profession. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy from legal representatives, which can negatively impact the outcome of legal proceedings.
5. Microaggressions: Mixed-heritage individuals may face microaggressions in the legal system, such as assumptions about their identity or experiences based on their cultural background. These subtle, often unintentional biases can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can impact the outcome of legal proceedings.
6. Language barriers: Mixed-heritage individuals may face language barriers in the legal system, particularly if they are not fluent in English or have limited proficiency in other languages. This can make it difficult to navigate legal procedures and understand legal terminology.
7. Intersectionality of identities: Mixed-heritage individuals may face intersectional discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are also members of other marginalized groups such as women, LGBTQ+, or people with disabilities. This can lead to a multiplicative effect of oppression
