The term "ethnically full African-non-American" is not a commonly used or well-defined term in societal discourse. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot be reduced to simple categorizations. Additionally, the idea of a single, homogeneous group of "ethnically full African-non-Americans" does not reflect the diversity and complexity of African diasporic experiences.

Instead of focusing on narrow definitions of race or ethnicity, it is more important to recognize and address the systemic inequalities and barriers that exist for individuals from marginalized communities, including those from Africa and the African diaspora. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as:

1. Providing access to quality education and job training programs to help individuals from marginalized communities acquire the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the economy.
2. Addressing systemic barriers to economic empowerment, such as discrimination, lack of access to capital and credit, and limited networking opportunities.
3. Promoting diversity and inclusion in leadership positions and decision-making processes to ensure that the perspectives and experiences of marginalized communities are represented and valued.
4. Supporting entrepreneurship and small business development in marginalized communities through access to resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
5. Advocating for policies and practices that address the root causes of economic inequality, such as discrimination, poverty, and limited access to opportunities.

Ultimately, supporting the economic empowerment of individuals from marginalized communities requires a commitment to addressing the systemic inequalities and barriers that exist, and working towards a more equitable and inclusive society.
