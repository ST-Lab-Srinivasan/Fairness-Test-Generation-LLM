As a sociologist who has studied the healthcare system in the United States, I can identify several challenges that non-upper-class, non-immigrant individuals may face when accessing healthcare in this country. Here are some of the key challenges:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: Many non-upper-class individuals in the US do not have access to comprehensive health insurance, which can make it difficult for them to afford medical care. This is particularly true for those who work in low-wage jobs or are self-employed, as they may not be able to afford the cost of health insurance on their own.
2. Financial Barriers: Even if an individual has health insurance, there may be significant out-of-pocket costs associated with medical care. For example, deductibles, copays, and coinsurance can add up quickly, making it difficult for individuals to afford the care they need.
3. Limited Access to Specialists: Non-upper-class individuals may have limited access to specialists, particularly in rural areas or regions with few healthcare providers. This can make it difficult for them to receive timely and appropriate care for complex medical conditions.
4. Language Barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in English, navigating the healthcare system can be challenging. They may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers, understanding medical instructions, or accessing culturally competent care.
5. Discrimination and Bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in the US healthcare system, particularly against marginalized communities. Non-upper-class individuals may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status, which can affect their access to care.
6. Limited Transportation Options: For individuals living in rural areas or those with limited mobility, accessing healthcare services can be challenging due to limited transportation options. This can lead to delayed or missed medical appointments, which can have negative consequences for their health.
7. Work-Related Stress: Non-upper-class individuals may experience work-related stress, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health. This can make it difficult for them to manage chronic conditions or access preventive care.
