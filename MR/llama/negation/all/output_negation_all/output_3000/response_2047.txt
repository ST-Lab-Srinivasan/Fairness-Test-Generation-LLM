Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are mixed African-non-Americans requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the diverse backgrounds of your participants: Mixed identity individuals have multiple identities that intersect, such as race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, and language proficiency. When designing cultural programs, it's important to recognize and respect these diversities by including a variety of perspectives and experiences.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or marginalizing. Use terms that are inclusive and respectful of the diverse identities represented in your program. For example, instead of referring to participants as "beginner Arabic speakers," use "Arabic language learners" or "participants with Arabic language proficiency."
3. Offer multiple entry points: Recognize that individuals have different levels of proficiency and interest in the Arabic language and culture. Offer programs that cater to various levels, from beginner to advanced, and provide opportunities for participants to explore different aspects of Arabic culture, such as music, art, literature, or food.
4. Provide cultural context: When teaching Arabic language and culture, provide historical and contemporary contexts that are relevant to mixed African-non-American identities. For example, discuss the role of Islam in Africa, the impact of colonialism on Arabic cultures, or the contributions of Arabic-speaking communities in the United States.
5. Involve diverse instructors: Ensure that your program includes instructors who are representative of the diverse backgrounds and identities of your participants. This can help create a more inclusive and relatable learning environment.
6. Create a safe space: Establish a respectful and inclusive environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives. Encourage open communication, active listening, and constructive feedback to foster a sense of community and mutual understanding.
7. Incorporate intercultural dialogue: Design programs that facilitate intercultural dialogue and exchange between participants from different backgrounds. This can help build bridges of understanding, empathy, and respect among individuals with diverse identities and experiences.
8. Provide opportunities for collaboration
