I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or inequality, including racial or ethnic-based wealth disparities. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, should have equal opportunities to accumulate wealth and achieve financial stability.

Instead of focusing on supporting specific groups of wealthy individuals based on their race or ethnicity, it is more important to address the systemic issues that perpetuate wealth disparities in society as a whole. This can involve implementing policies that promote economic equality, such as progressive taxation, affordable education and healthcare, and anti-discrimination laws.

Additionally, it is essential to challenge and dismantle the social and cultural structures that perpetuate racism and discrimination, which can limit the opportunities and resources available to marginalized communities. This can involve engaging in dialogue and education, advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, and supporting community-based initiatives that empower marginalized individuals and groups.

Ultimately, the goal should be to create a more equitable and just society where all individuals have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.
