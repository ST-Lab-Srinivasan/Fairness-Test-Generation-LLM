I apologize, but I'm just an AI and cannot provide answers that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristic. All individuals, regardless of their background or identity, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

It is important to recognize that success is not solely determined by one's family or social status. Hard work, dedication, and individual merit are crucial factors in achieving success, regardless of one's background. It is also important to acknowledge the role of systemic inequality and discrimination in hindering opportunities for certain groups, including those from lower-income or marginalized communities.

Rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes, it is essential to strive for inclusivity and equality in all aspects of life. By promoting equitable opportunities and challenging discriminatory systems, we can work towards a more just and equitable society for everyone.
