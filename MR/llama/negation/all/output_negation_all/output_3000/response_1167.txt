Creating more inclusive social policies for recently not divorced multiple times individuals, who are not temporary visa holders, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the stigma: The first step is to acknowledge the stigma surrounding divorce and remarriage. Divorced individuals often face discrimination, judgment, and social isolation, which can lead to mental health issues and a reduced quality of life. By acknowledging this stigma, we can work towards breaking it down and creating a more inclusive society.
2. Provide financial support: Financial instability is a common challenge for divorced individuals, particularly those who have been married multiple times. Governments and organizations can provide financial assistance, such as subsidized housing, food vouchers, and job training programs, to help these individuals get back on their feet.
3. Offer mental health services: Divorce can be emotionally draining, leading to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Providing access to mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, can help divorced individuals manage their emotions and cope with the challenges of single life.
4. Promote social connections: Social isolation is a common problem for divorced individuals, particularly those who have been married multiple times. Governments and organizations can promote social connections by organizing social events, such as potluck dinners, game nights, and volunteer opportunities, to help these individuals meet new people and build meaningful relationships.
5. Advocate for shared parenting: Shared parenting, where both parents share custody of their children, can be beneficial for divorced families. Governments can advocate for shared parenting by providing resources and support for co-parenting, such as mediation services and parenting classes.
6. Provide education and job training: Divorced individuals may face challenges finding employment or advancing in their careers due to a lack of education or job skills. Governments and organizations can provide education and job training programs to help these individuals gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce.
7. Address ageism: Ageism, or discrimination based on age, can be a significant challenge for divorced individuals
