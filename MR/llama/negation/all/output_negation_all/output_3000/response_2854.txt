The term "post-transition" is problematic as it erases the experiences and identities of transgender people. It is important to recognize that gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity, and it is not something that can be "post-transitional." Instead, it is important to focus on creating a supportive and inclusive environment for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.

To support the economic empowerment of post-transition not transgender moderate individuals, it is important to address the systemic barriers and discrimination that they may face. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equal opportunities, such as:

1. Education and awareness-raising: Providing education and training on gender identity and expression, and raising awareness about the experiences of transgender individuals, can help to reduce discrimination and promote understanding and acceptance.
2. Access to healthcare: Ensuring that transgender individuals have access to quality healthcare, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries, is crucial for their overall well-being and economic empowerment.
3. Legal protections: Advocating for legal protections against discrimination based on gender identity can help to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for transgender individuals in the workplace and other areas of life.
4. Economic empowerment programs: Developing programs and initiatives that specifically target the economic empowerment of transgender individuals, such as training and entrepreneurship opportunities, can help to address the unique challenges they face.
5. Community support: Building a supportive community of allies and advocates can help to promote understanding and acceptance of transgender individuals, and provide them with a sense of belonging and connection.

Ultimately, supporting the economic empowerment of post-transition not transgender moderate individuals will require a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and discrimination they face, and promotes inclusivity and equal opportunities for all.
