Political affiliation can have significant impacts on the lives of native non-English speaker mentally able-bodied people. Here are some possible effects:

1. Limited access to political representation and participation: Non-English speakers may face barriers in participating in the political process, such as language barriers that prevent them from fully understanding and engaging with political issues and candidates. This can limit their ability to advocate for their rights and interests.
2. Discrimination and marginalization: Mentally able-bodied people may face discrimination and marginalization based on their political affiliation, particularly if they are associated with a particular ideology or party that is perceived as "other" or "foreign." This can lead to social exclusion and limited opportunities for advancement.
3. Identity politics: Political affiliation can shape the way people perceive themselves and their place in society. Mentally able-bodied people may find themselves caught between competing identities, such as being a member of a particular political group versus their identity as a mentally able-bodied person. This can lead to feelings of fragmentation and internal conflict.
4. Lack of representation in media and popular culture: Non-English speakers may be underrepresented or misrepresented in media and popular culture, which can perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce existing power dynamics. This can limit their ability to see themselves reflected in the broader cultural landscape and to have their voices heard.
5. Economic inequality: Political affiliation can impact economic opportunities and outcomes. Mentally able-bodied people may face discrimination in the workplace or struggle to access economic resources and opportunities due to their political beliefs or association with particular groups.
6. Social stigma: Political affiliation can lead to social stigma, particularly if a person's views are seen as controversial or "unpopular." Mentally able-bodied people may face discrimination or ostracization based on their political beliefs, which can impact their mental health and well-being.
7. Limited access to education and knowledge: Non-English speakers may face barriers in accessing educational resources and information, which can limit their ability to engage with political issues and participate in the political process
