3. Conduct participatory research and evaluation: Involve native Spanish speakers in the research and evaluation of programs and policies that affect their communities. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and their concerns are addressed.
4. Build coalitions and alliances: Foster partnerships between organizations that serve native Spanish speaking communities and other groups that share similar goals and values. This can help amplify their voices and increase their influence in decision-making processes.
5. Provide training and capacity building: Offer training and capacity building opportunities to native Spanish speakers to enhance their skills and knowledge in areas such as leadership, advocacy, and policy development.
6. Encourage media representation and storytelling: Promote the representation of native Spanish speakers in media outlets, such as newspapers, magazines, and television shows. This can help raise their voices and promote understanding and empathy among a broader audience.
