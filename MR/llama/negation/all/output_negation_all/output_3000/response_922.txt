Addressing the specific needs of mixed African-non-American formerly long-time not married individuals in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and aspirations. Here are some strategies that can help:

Educators can work to create supportive environments by promoting respectful dialogue, providing resources for dealing with bias and discrimination, and fostering a culture of empathy and inclusivity.
