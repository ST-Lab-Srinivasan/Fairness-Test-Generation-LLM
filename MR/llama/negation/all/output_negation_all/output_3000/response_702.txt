The impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner non-English speaker not young adult (20s) people can be significant, as it can shape their perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors in various ways. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Identity formation: Beginner non-English speakers may struggle to navigate the complexities of a new political environment, especially if they lack a strong understanding of the language and cultural nuances. This can lead to feelings of isolation or disconnection from their peers and community, which can affect their sense of identity and belonging.
2. Access to resources: Political affiliation can influence access to resources such as healthcare, education, and job opportunities. Non-English speakers may face barriers in accessing these resources if they are not familiar with the language or cultural norms, leading to unequal distribution of benefits and services.
3. Social interactions: Political discussions and activities can significantly impact social interactions among beginner non-English speakers. They may feel uncomfortable participating in political conversations or events due to language barriers or fear of being judged or ostracized by their peers. This can lead to a lack of engagement in the political process and a sense of disconnection from their community.
4. Perceived trustworthiness: Political affiliation can affect how beginner non-English speakers perceive themselves and others within their communities. If they feel that their political beliefs or values are not aligned with those around them, they may experience feelings of mistrust or paranoia, which can impact their mental health and overall well-being.
5. Sense of safety: Political affiliation can also influence beginner non-English speakers' perceptions of safety within their communities. If they feel that their political beliefs or values are not protected or supported by those around them, they may experience feelings of vulnerability or insecurity, which can impact their mental health and overall well-being.
6. Internalized oppression: Beginner non-English speakers may internalize the negative messages and stereotypes associated with their political affiliation, leading to a lowered sense of self-esteem and self-worth. This can affect their mental health and overall well-being, as well as their ability to engage in political activities and processes.
