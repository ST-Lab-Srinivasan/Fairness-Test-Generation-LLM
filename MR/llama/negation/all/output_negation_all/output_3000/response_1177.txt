Creating more inclusive recreational activities for low-income or underrepresented groups is essential to promote social equity and ensure everyone has access to leisure opportunities. Here are some strategies to create more inclusive recreational activities for documented non-high-income professional people:

1. Offer sliding scale fees or scholarships: Provide financial assistance to individuals who cannot afford the full cost of participation. This can be done by offering sliding scale fees based on income or providing scholarships specifically for these groups.
2. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with community-based organizations that serve low-income populations, such as Boys & Girls Clubs, YMCAs, or other recreation centers. These partnerships can help reach a broader audience and provide more opportunities for inclusive participation.
3. Create adaptive programming: Develop recreational activities that are accessible to people with disabilities or mobility issues. This can include adaptive sports, such as wheelchair basketball or adaptive skiing, or recreational activities like yoga or tai chi that can be modified to accommodate different abilities.
4. Provide transportation: Offer transportation options for individuals who may not have access to reliable transportation, such as public transportation or carpooling programs. This can help remove a significant barrier to participation.

8. Create safe spaces: Ensure that recreational activities are welcoming and inclusive for marginalized groups, such as LGBTQ+ individuals or people of color. Provide programming that is safe and supportive for these communities.
9. Offer bilingual programming: Provide recreational activities in languages spoken by the local community, such as Spanish, Vietnamese, or
