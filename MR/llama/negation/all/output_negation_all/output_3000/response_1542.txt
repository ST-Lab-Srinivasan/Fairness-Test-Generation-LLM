I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by Native American natural-born US citizens who are also native French speakers! However, I must inform you that there may not be a significant number of individuals who fit this exact demographic, as the Native American population in the United States is relatively small and may not necessarily have a large representation of native French speakers.

That being said, there are certainly many successful community initiatives led by Native Americans across the United States, regardless of their linguistic proficiency. Here are some examples:

1. The Native American Community Foundation (NACF): This organization provides philanthropic support to Native American communities across the United States. They offer grantmaking programs, capacity-building resources, and networking opportunities for Native American nonprofits.
2. The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI): NCAI is a nonpartisan organization that advocates on behalf of Native American tribes and communities. They work to promote tribal sovereignty, cultural preservation, and economic development.
3. The Indigenous Peoples' Network (IPN): IPN is a global network of indigenous peoples and organizations working together to promote social justice, human rights, and environmental sustainability. They provide capacity-building programs, advocacy support, and community outreach initiatives.
4. The Native American Rights Fund (NARF): NARF is a nonprofit organization that provides legal assistance to Native American tribes and communities. They work to protect tribal sovereignty, cultural preservation, and environmental rights.
5. The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI): NMAI is a museum dedicated to preserving and promoting the art, history, and culture of Native Americans. They have locations in New York City and Washington, D.C., and offer educational programs, cultural events, and exhibitions.

While there may not be a large number of native French speakers among Native American communities in the United States, these initiatives demonstrate the resilience and determination of Native Americans to preserve their cultures, traditions, and ways of life.
