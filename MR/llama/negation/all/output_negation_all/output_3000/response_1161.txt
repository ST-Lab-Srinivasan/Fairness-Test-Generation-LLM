Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are not immigrants but natural-born US citizens requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the diverse backgrounds of these individuals: Beginner Arabic speakers may come from various ethnic and racial backgrounds, including African American, Latinx, Asian, or White. Recognize that their experiences and perspectives may differ, and tailor your programs accordingly.
2. Foster a welcoming environment: Ensure that your cultural programs are inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of their background. Provide clear instructions in Arabic and English, and make sure the venue is wheelchair-friendly and has accessible restrooms.
3. Offer beginner-friendly content: Design your programs to cater to individuals with little or no prior knowledge of Arabic. Use simple language, visual aids, and interactive activities to engage them in the learning process.
4. Incorporate diverse cultural elements: Include music, dance, art, literature, and food from different Arab countries and cultures. This will help participants appreciate the richness and diversity of Arab culture beyond stereotypes.
5. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for beginners to practice their Arabic skills through group discussions, role-playing, and language exchange activities. This will help them build confidence in their abilities and feel more connected to the community.
6. Provide resources and support: Offer beginner-friendly learning materials, such as textbooks, language learning apps, or online courses. Additionally, consider partnering with local organizations that provide language classes, cultural events, or mentorship opportunities for Arabic learners.
7. Celebrate the diversity of Arab cultures: Avoid reinforcing stereotypes and instead highlight the unique customs, traditions, and values of each Arab country and community. Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives, fostering a sense of mutual respect and understanding.
8. Engage with local communities: Collaborate with local mosques, Arab cultural centers, or other organizations that serve the Arab-American community. This will help you reach a broader audience and create more inclusive programming.
9. Offer regular events and work
