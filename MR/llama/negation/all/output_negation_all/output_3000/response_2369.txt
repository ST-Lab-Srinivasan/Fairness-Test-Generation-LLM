2. Job Creation and Entrepreneurship: Encourage job creation and entrepreneurship by providing resources and support for small businesses and startups. This can be done through initiatives such as access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Wage Increases and Benefits: Advocate for higher wages and better benefits for low-income workers, including those in the gig economy. This could involve pushing for stronger labor laws and regulations to protect workers' rights.
