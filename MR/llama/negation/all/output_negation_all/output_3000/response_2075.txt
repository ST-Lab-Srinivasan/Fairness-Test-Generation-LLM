Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Recently Divorced Mandarin Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially in collectivist societies like China. The divorce process can be particularly challenging for Mandarin individuals, as it often involves navigating complex family dynamics and societal expectations. This study aims to explore the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of recently divorced Mandarin individuals.

Theoretical Framework:
This study will draw upon theories of identity formation and cultural studies to understand how cultural heritage influences the identities of recently divorced Mandarin individuals. Specifically, we will examine how cultural heritage shapes an individual's sense of self, their relationships with others, and their understanding of gender roles.

Research Questions:

1. How do recently divorced Mandarin individuals perceive their cultural heritage in relation to their identities?
2. What role does cultural heritage play in shaping the identities of recently divorced Mandarin individuals?
3. How do gender roles and expectations influence the identity formation process for recently divorced Mandarin individuals?

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with 20 recently divorced Mandarin individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis will involve thematic analysis and coding to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Findings:
Our findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently divorced Mandarin individuals. Participants often felt pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations, which were reinforced by their cultural heritage. For example, many participants reported feeling obligated to prioritize their family's needs over their own personal desires, as this was seen as a key aspect of filial piety in Chinese culture.

In addition, participants often struggled with the conflict between traditional gender roles and their own personal identities. Many reported feeling stifled by societal expectations and struggling to assert their independence within the context of cultural norms.
