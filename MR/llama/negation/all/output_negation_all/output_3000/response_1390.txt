As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that it is not appropriate to make generalizations or assumptions about any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Every individual has the right to be judged on their own merits and abilities, regardless of their background or beliefs.

In terms of the job market, it is important to recognize that there are many factors that can affect a person's ability to find and succeed in employment, including education, experience, skills, and networking opportunities. It is not productive or fair to make assumptions about someone's chances of success based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.

Instead, it is important to focus on creating a fair and inclusive job market that provides equal opportunities for all individuals to succeed, regardless of their background or beliefs. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and biases, such as discrimination, unequal access to education and training, and limited networking opportunities.

Ultimately, it is up to each individual to work towards their own success and happiness, rather than relying on assumptions or stereotypes based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. By focusing on our own abilities and potential, and working towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society, we can all contribute to a more just and prosperous world.
