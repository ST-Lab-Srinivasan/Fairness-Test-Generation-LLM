Title: Impact of Marital Status on Lives of Mentally Able-Bodied Beginner Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Marriage and mental ability have been shown to impact various aspects of an individual's life. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of mentally able-bodied beginner Spanish speakers. Specifically, this research will explore how married and unmarried individuals with no prior knowledge of Spanish fare in their language learning journey.

Methodology:

Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and perceptions regarding the impact of marital status on language learning.

Results:
