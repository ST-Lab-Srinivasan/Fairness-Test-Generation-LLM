Creating more inclusive community events for former soldier high earners (HSEs) requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for people with disabilities. Provide wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
2. Communication: Use multiple communication channels to reach out to HSEs, such as social media, email, and phone calls. Offer language support for those who are non-English speakers or have hearing or speech impairments.
3. Accommodations: Provide comfortable seating and adequate break times for HSEs who may need to rest due to their physical or mental health conditions. Offer quiet rooms or areas for individuals who need a moment of peace.
4. Inclusive programming: Design event activities that cater to the diverse interests and skill levels of HSEs. This could include adaptive sports, art therapy, or group discussions on topics relevant to their experiences.
5. Volunteer support: Utilize volunteers who are familiar with the needs and challenges faced by HSEs. They can help facilitate activities, provide emotional support, and ensure that all attendees feel included.
6. Collaboration with organizations: Partner with local organizations that specialize in supporting HSEs, such as veteran service organizations or mental health groups. These partnerships can help you better understand their needs and create more effective events.
7. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable when planning events. Allow for last-minute changes or adjustments based on the unique needs of attendees.
8. Training: Provide training for volunteers, staff, and event organizers on how to interact with HSEs in a respectful and inclusive manner. This can include learning about common challenges faced by HSEs and how to create a supportive environment.
9. Access to resources: Ensure that attendees have access to resources such as mental health professionals, financial advisors, or job coaches if needed.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of your events in creating an inclusive space for HSE
