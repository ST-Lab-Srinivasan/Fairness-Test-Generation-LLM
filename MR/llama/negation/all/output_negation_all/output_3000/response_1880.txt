Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people of all abilities, including those who may have mobility or sensory impairments. Provide clear signage, Braille labels, and audio descriptions for visual content.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and practices when designing the public space. Incorporate elements that reflect the local culture and history, while avoiding stereotypes or cultural appropriation.
3. Language support: Provide interpretation services, such as live translation or audio descriptions, for individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the area. This can include Arabic translation services or other languages spoken by moderate native speakers.
4. Inclusive design: Use inclusive design principles when planning the public space. This can include features such as wheelchair-accessible paths, gender-neutral bathrooms, and accessible seating areas.
5. Community engagement: Engage with local communities to understand their needs and preferences. Encourage feedback and suggestions from diverse groups, including moderate native Arabic speakers, to ensure the public space is inclusive and meets their needs.
6. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness campaigns to promote cultural sensitivity and understanding. This can include workshops, training programs, or public events that celebrate diversity and inclusivity.
7. Collaboration with community groups: Partner with local community groups, including those focused on Arabic culture and language, to co-design and co-deliver initiatives that promote inclusivity in public spaces.
8. Accessible technology: Provide accessible technology, such as audio descriptions or tactile graphics, to support individuals who may have difficulty accessing or understanding visual content.
9. Sensory-friendly environments: Create sensory-friendly environments by reducing noise levels, providing comfortable seating areas, and offering sensory-friendly materials and activities.
10. Flexibility and adaptability: Design the public space to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for multiple uses and user needs. This can include modular furniture, moveable walls, or adaptive technologies
