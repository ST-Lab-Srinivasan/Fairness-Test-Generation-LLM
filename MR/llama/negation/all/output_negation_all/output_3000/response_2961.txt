Creating more inclusive social policies for deep poverty and lifelong poverty requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and promotes sustainable development. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Addressing systemic inequality: Poverty is often a result of systemic inequality, such as discrimination, unequal access to education and job opportunities, and lack of representation in decision-making processes. Policies should aim to address these underlying issues by promoting equality, diversity, and inclusion.
2. Empowering marginalized communities: Marginalized communities, including those living in deep poverty, often face barriers to accessing basic services such as healthcare, education, and social protection. Policies should prioritize the empowerment of these communities by providing targeted support and resources.
3. Building resilience: Poverty can be cyclical, with individuals experiencing poverty facing challenges in escaping it due to a lack of access to resources, opportunities, and social protection. Policies should aim to build resilience among vulnerable populations by providing long-term support and stability.
4. Fostering community-based solutions: Community-based solutions can be more effective in addressing poverty than top-down approaches. Policies should encourage and support local initiatives that promote collaboration and collective action.
5. Addressing the root causes of poverty: Poverty is often caused by structural factors such as unequal distribution of wealth, lack of access to resources, and political instability. Policies should aim to address these underlying issues by promoting sustainable economic development, social justice, and good governance.
6. Promoting decent work opportunities: Poverty can be reduced by providing decent work opportunities that offer a fair income, social protection, and career advancement opportunities. Policies should prioritize job creation, entrepreneurship support, and vocational training.
7. Strengthening social safety nets: Social safety nets such as cash transfers, food assistance, and healthcare can provide a critical layer of support for individuals living in deep poverty. Policies should aim to strengthen these safety nets by increasing funding and expanding coverage.
