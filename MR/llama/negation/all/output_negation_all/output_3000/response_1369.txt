As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that the term "native Arabic speaker ethnically full African-non-American people" is not a recognized or valid racial or ethnic category. The concept of race and ethnicity is complex and multifaceted, and it is important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their perceived racial or ethnic identity.

However, I understand that you are asking about the challenges faced by certain groups of people in the legal system. Here are some potential challenges that have been reported by various organizations and individuals:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of their country or region may face difficulties navigating the legal system, particularly if they are not provided with appropriate interpretation or translation services.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultures have different norms, values, and beliefs that can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications within the legal system. For example, some cultures may place a higher value on collectivism than individualism, which can affect how they approach legal issues.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin is still prevalent in many parts of the world. This can lead to biased treatment within the legal system, including unequal access to resources and opportunities.
4. Lack of representation: In some areas, individuals from marginalized communities may have limited access to legal representation due to financial constraints or a lack of culturally sensitive attorneys. This can result in a disproportionate impact on these communities within the legal system.
5. Criminalization of cultural practices: In some cases, cultural practices or beliefs may be criminalized or discriminated against by the legal system. For example, laws that prohibit certain traditional practices or dress codes may disproportionately affect individuals from marginalized communities.
6. Lack of understanding of cultural norms: Legal professionals may not always understand the cultural nuances and values of the communities they serve, which can lead to misunderstandings or misapplications of the law.
7. Limited access to legal resources: In some areas, individuals from marginalized communities may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, research materials, or technology.
