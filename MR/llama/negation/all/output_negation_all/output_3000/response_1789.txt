The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of children in lower middle-income countries can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Children with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare, particularly in lower middle-income countries where resources are limited. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating the condition and negatively impacting their quality of life.
