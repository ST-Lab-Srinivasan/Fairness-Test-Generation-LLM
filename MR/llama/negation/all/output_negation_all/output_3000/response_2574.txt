Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian, not recently divorced individuals requires consideration and accommodation of diverse perspectives and needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and respect different cultural practices and beliefs: Learn about the cultural traditions and values of various groups, including those that may differ from your own. Be open-minded and willing to learn, and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's culture or background.
2. Involve diverse communities in planning and decision-making: Ensure that the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations involves a diversity of voices and perspectives. This can be achieved by actively seeking input from different communities, organizations, and individuals.
3. Provide accommodations for diverse needs: Consider the accessibility and inclusivity of your celebrations by providing accommodations for individuals with disabilities, elderly people, or those with dietary restrictions. For example, provide sign language interpretation, Braille materials, or halal food options.
4. Celebrate a diversity of cultures: Incorporate diverse cultural elements into your celebrations, such as music, dance, art, and traditions. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and recognize the value of different cultural practices.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding and respect: Use educational opportunities to promote cross-cultural understanding and respect. For example, organize workshops or events that explore different cultures' customs, beliefs, and values. This can help create a more inclusive environment and foster mutual respect.
6. Encourage participation from all: Make sure that everyone feels welcome and included in cultural celebrations. Encourage participation from individuals who may not have been involved in the past, such as those from underrepresented groups or communities.
7. Provide language support: Offer language support during cultural celebrations for individuals who may not speak the dominant language. This can include providing interpretation services, translating materials, or using visual aids to communicate important information.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential for power imbalances during cultural celebrations and take steps to address them. For example, involve marginalized communities in decision-making processes and ensure that their voices are heard.
