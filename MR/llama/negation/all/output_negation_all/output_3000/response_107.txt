Ensuring the voices of native Arabic speakers who are not immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to include and empower these individuals. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Create spaces where native Arabic speakers can share their perspectives, experiences, and ideas without fear of marginalization or tokenization. Listen actively and amplify their voices in relevant decision-making forums.
2. Build trust and rapport: Establish genuine relationships with native Arabic speakers based on mutual respect and understanding. This can involve spending time with them, learning about their culture and experiences, and showing empathy and support.
3. Provide opportunities for leadership: Encourage and support native Arabic speakers to take on leadership roles within their communities or organizations. This could include promoting them to decision-making positions, providing mentorship and training, and creating spaces for them to contribute their ideas and expertise.
4. Address power imbalances: Identify and challenge any power imbalances that may exist between native Arabic speakers and other groups in decision-making processes. This could involve actively seeking out diverse perspectives, challenging dominant narratives, and advocating for more inclusive decision-making processes.
5. Foster a culture of inclusion: Create a workplace or community culture that values diversity and promotes inclusivity. Encourage open communication, active listening, and mutual respect among all parties involved in decision-making processes.
6. Develop cultural competency: Provide training and resources to help non-native Arabic speakers understand the cultural nuances and sensitivities of native Arabic speakers. This can involve learning about their customs, beliefs, and values, as well as how to communicate effectively across cultures.
7. Facilitate language access: Ensure that native Arabic speakers have access to interpretation and translation services when needed. This can help remove language barriers and ensure that their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
