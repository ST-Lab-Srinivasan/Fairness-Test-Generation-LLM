Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for ethnically full, non-Asian, devout practicing non-Hindus requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse communities: Reach out to diverse communities and involve them in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations. This will ensure that the events reflect the needs and preferences of different ethnicities and religions.
2. Offer diverse options: Provide a range of activities and events that cater to different tastes and preferences. For example, offer vegetarian and non-vegetarian food options during Hindu festivals, and provide halal and kosher options for Muslim and Jewish communities.
3. Create inclusive spaces: Design cultural celebrations that are accessible and inclusive for everyone. This can be achieved by providing wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and other accommodations as needed.
4. Learn from each other: Encourage intercultural exchange and learning between different communities. This can help break down barriers and promote mutual understanding and respect.
5. Challenge stereotypes: Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing dominant cultural narratives that marginalize certain groups. Instead, highlight the diversity and richness of each culture.
6. Foster dialogue and collaboration: Encourage open communication and collaboration between different communities. This can help build trust and understanding, and lead to more inclusive and meaningful cultural celebrations.
7. Be mindful of representation: Ensure that diverse communities are represented in leadership positions and decision-making processes related to cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account.
8. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and awareness for those involved in planning and executing cultural celebrations. This can help promote a deeper understanding of different cultures and practices.
9. Create safe spaces: Establish safe spaces for individuals from diverse backgrounds to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by providing designated areas for different communities to gather and share their cultural practices.
10. Be adaptable: Be willing to adapt and make changes as needed to ensure that cultural celebrations are inclusive and respectful of all communities involved
