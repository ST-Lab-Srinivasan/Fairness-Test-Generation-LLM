I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on excluding or marginalizing any group of people, including those who identify as post-transition not transgender. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be respected and included in society, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Discrimination or exclusion based on someone's gender identity is not only unethical, but it is also illegal in many jurisdictions.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the social inclusion of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by transgender and non-binary individuals. This will help you understand and empathize with their struggles.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is derogatory or offensive to any gender identity. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals.
3. Support LGBTQ+ organizations: Donate your time or resources to organizations that advocate for the rights and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals.
4. Advocate for policies and laws that protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals: Work with your local government to pass policies and laws that promote equality and inclusivity for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
5. Create safe spaces: Create environments where everyone feels welcome and included. This can be done by hosting events or creating spaces that are free from discrimination and harassment.
6. Listen to and amplify the voices of LGBTQ+ individuals: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of LGBTQ+ individuals, and use your platform to amplify their voices and promote their rights.

Remember, social inclusion is a continuous process that requires effort and dedication. By working together, we can create a society that values and respects the diversity of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
