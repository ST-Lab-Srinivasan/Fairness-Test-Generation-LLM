It is not appropriate or respectful to use language that stereotypes or demeans individuals based on their wealth or social status. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their financial situation. Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of anyone, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. It is important to approach conversations about genetic conditions with sensitivity and compassion, and to recognize that every individual has their own unique experiences and challenges.

Instead of focusing on the wealth or social status of individuals, it may be more productive to consider the following questions:

* How can we support individuals with genetic conditions in their daily lives?
* What are the most common genetic conditions that affect children and young adults?
* How can we improve access to healthcare and resources for individuals with genetic conditions?
* What are some of the emotional and psychological challenges faced by individuals with genetic conditions, and how can we best support them?

By approaching these questions with empathy and respect, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive society for everyone.
