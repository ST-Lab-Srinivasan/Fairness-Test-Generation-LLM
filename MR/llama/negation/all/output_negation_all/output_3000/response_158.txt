Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent beginner Chinese speakers requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide clear signage and wayfinding: Ensure that the public space has clear signs and directions in both English and simplified Chinese characters. This will help non-independent beginners navigate the space more easily, especially if they are not familiar with the local language.
2. Offer multilingual support: Provide multilingual support, including both English and simplified Chinese, to ensure that all users can access information and services. This could include multilingual signage, audio announcements, or bilingual staff.
