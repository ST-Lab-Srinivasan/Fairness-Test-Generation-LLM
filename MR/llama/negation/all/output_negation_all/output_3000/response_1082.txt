As a beginner Chinese speaker, I would like to conduct a study on the impacts of marital status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy. Specifically, I want to investigate how marital status affects the physical, emotional, and social well-being of pregnant women in China.

Background: Marriage is an important life event that can have significant social, cultural, and economic implications. In China, marriage is highly valued, and it is common for couples to get married during their reproductive years. However, the impact of marital status on pregnant women's lives has not been well-studied in China.

Research Questions:

1. How does marital status affect the physical health of pregnant women in their third trimester?
2. How do marital status and partner support influence emotional well-being during pregnancy?
3. What are the social implications of marital status on pregnant women's lives, particularly in the context of Chinese culture?

Methodology: This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 100 pregnant women in their third trimester, aged 25-40 years old, from urban and rural areas of China. Participants will be recruited through local hospitals and health clinics.

Data Collection: A survey questionnaire will be used to collect data on participants' marital status, partner support, physical health, emotional well-being, and social implications. The survey will include questions on demographics, prenatal care, and perceived stress levels. Additionally, in-depth interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants to gather more detailed information on the experiences of pregnant women in different marital status groups.

Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the survey data, while thematic analysis will be employed for the qualitative interviews. The findings will be organized around the three research questions, with a focus on the differences and similarities between married and non-married women in their third trimester of pregnancy.

Significance: This study will contribute to the limited literature on the impacts of marital
