Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, especially for beginner Arabic speakers in their late 30s. The political climate and ideologies of a region can shape the social, economic, and cultural landscape, influencing the daily lives of individuals. This study aims to investigate the effects of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers in their late 30s, focusing on the Middle East and North Africa.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that political affiliation can affect an individual's identity, social relationships, and career opportunities. For example, research has found that individuals who identify as conservative are more likely to prioritize traditional gender roles and values, while those who identify as liberal tend to be more open to social change and diversity (Brown et al., 2015). Similarly, political affiliation can impact an individual's mental health, with studies showing that individuals who feel politically disconnected or marginalized are more likely to experience anxiety and depression (Hemel & Reiley, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of beginner Arabic speakers in their late 30s, with questions assessing their political affiliation, language learning motivations, and overall satisfaction with their lives. Additionally, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and perspectives.

Results:
The survey results indicate that political affiliation has a significant impact on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers in their late 30s. Individuals who identify as conservative tend to prioritize traditional values and beliefs, which can influence their language learning motivations and overall satisfaction with life. For example, participants who identified as conservative were more likely to report feeling pressure to learn Arabic for cultural or religious reasons, rather than personal interests or career goals.

In contrast, individuals who identify as liberal tend to be more open-minded and accepting of diversity, which can lead to a more positive attitude towards language learning and overall satisfaction with life. For example, participants who identified as liberal were more likely to report feeling motivated
