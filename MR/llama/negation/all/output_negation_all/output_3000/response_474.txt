To ensure that the educational needs of Mandarin language learners who are not yet proficient in Chinese are met, here are some strategies that teachers and educators can implement:

1. Differentiated Instruction: Teachers can use differentiated instruction to cater to the diverse needs of students. This involves tailoring teaching methods, activities, and assessments to meet the individual needs of each student. For example, some students may need more time to understand complex grammar rules, while others may require more advanced vocabulary and sentence structures.
2. Visual Aids: Using visual aids such as pictures, videos, and flashcards can help students who are not yet proficient in Chinese to learn new words and phrases. This can also help to make the learning process more engaging and interactive.

4. Cultural Immersion: Providing opportunities for cultural immersion can help students to better understand the context and nuances of the language. This can involve incorporating authentic materials such as music, movies, and news articles into the classroom, or organizing field trips to Chinese cultural events.

These tools can offer personalized learning experiences, interactive exercises, and real-time feedback to help students improve their language skills.
7. Parent Involvement: Encouraging parents to get involved in their child's language learning journey can help to reinforce the learning process outside of the classroom. This can involve activities such as practicing language drills together, attending cultural events, or providing additional support and resources for students.
8. Formative Assessments: Regularly administering formative assessments throughout the course can help teachers to
