The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who are not widowed for a long time can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or lack of accessibility in their communities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
2. Limited employment opportunities: Permanent residents with disabilities may face barriers to finding and keeping employment due to discrimination, inaccessible workplaces, or lack of accommodations. This can result in financial instability and independence.
3. Health disparities: People with disabilities may experience worse health outcomes than their non-disabled peers due to inadequate access to healthcare, lack of physical activity, or poor nutrition.
4. Inaccessible housing: Permanent residents with disabilities may face challenges in finding and maintaining accessible and affordable housing, leading to overcrowding or homelessness.
5. Lack of representation: People with disabilities may be underrepresented in decision-making roles, such as government positions or community leadership, due to discrimination or lack of accessibility in the application process.
6. Inadequate transportation: Permanent residents with disabilities may face barriers in accessing transportation, such as public transit or driving, due to inaccessible vehicles or infrastructure.
7. Limited education and training: People with disabilities may have limited access to education and training opportunities due to discrimination, inadequate accommodations, or lack of funding for disability-specific programs.
8. Financial strain: Permanent residents with disabilities may face financial challenges due to higher costs associated with disability, such as assistive technology, home modifications, or medical expenses.
9. Emotional toll: Living with a disability can take an emotional toll on individuals and their families, leading to stress, anxiety, and depression.
10. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities may face stigma and discrimination in their daily lives, which can lead to social exclusion, lowered self-esteem, and decreased quality of life
