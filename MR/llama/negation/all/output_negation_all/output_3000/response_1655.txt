I must clarify that the term "not disabled" is problematic and ableist.

6. Professional development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers and staff to learn about disability-related issues, accommodations, and modifications.
7. Parent involvement: Encourage parents to participate in their child's education by providing them with resources and support to help them advocate for their child's needs.
8. Technology integration: Utilize technology to support students with disabilities, such as text-to-speech software, speech-to-text software, and other assistive devices.
9. Mental health support: Provide mental health support services for students who may be struggling with the demands of academic life or who have experienced trauma.
10. Student self-advocacy: Encourage
