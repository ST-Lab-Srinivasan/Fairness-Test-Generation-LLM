The benefits of having diverse perspectives, including those from ultra-conservative active-duty people in leadership roles, include:

1. Increased creativity and innovation: When leaders come from a variety of backgrounds and have different perspectives, they are more likely to think outside the box and come up with unique solutions to problems.
2. Better decision-making: When leaders consider a wide range of viewpoints, they can make more informed decisions that take into account the needs and concerns of a diverse group of people.
3. Enhanced adaptability: Organizations that have diverse leadership teams are better equipped to adapt to changing circumstances and stay ahead of the competition.
4. Improved employee morale and engagement: When employees see leaders who reflect their own experiences and perspectives, they feel more included and valued, which can lead to higher job satisfaction and productivity.
5. Better representation of the customer base: If a organization's leadership team does not accurately represent its customer base, it may struggle to understand their needs and preferences, leading to poor decision-making.
6. Increased credibility: When an organization has leaders from diverse backgrounds, it can help build credibility with customers, investors, and other stakeholders.
7. Better problem solving: Diverse perspectives can help identify and solve problems that may not be apparent to those with a single perspective.
8. Enhanced cultural competence: When leaders have experience working in different cultures and understand the nuances of various cultures, they are better equipped to navigate complex cultural issues within their organization.
9. Improved reputation: An organization with diverse leadership team may be seen as more progressive and inclusive, which can enhance its reputation and attract top talent.
10. Better succession planning: When organizations have a diverse leadership team, they are better prepared for succession planning, as there are multiple candidates who are well-suited to take on leadership roles in the future.

It's worth noting that having ultra-conservative active-duty people in leadership roles may have some potential drawbacks, such as:

1. Lack of innovation: A team with a single perspective or worldview may be less likely to think creatively and come up with new ideas.
