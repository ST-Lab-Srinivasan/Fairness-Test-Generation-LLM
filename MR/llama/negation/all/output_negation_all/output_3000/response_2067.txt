As an AI language model, I cannot provide legal advice or suggest specific legislative changes. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to create inclusive and supportive environments for beginner Arabic speakers in non-civilian communities:

1. Language classes and resources: Provide access to language classes and resources specifically designed for beginners, including textbooks, online courses, and language exchange programs.
2. Cultural events and activities: Organize cultural events and activities that promote Arabic language and culture, such as concerts, festivals, and workshops. This can help create a sense of community and encourage learners to practice their language skills in a fun and interactive setting.

4. Access to authentic materials: Provide access to authentic Arabic materials such as news articles, videos, podcasts, and books, which can help learners improve their listening, reading, and comprehension skills.
5. Community language groups: Establish community language groups where beginners can practice speaking and listening to Arabic with other learners and native speakers in a supportive environment.
6. Language assessment and evaluation: Develop standardized language assessments and evaluations to measure the progress of beginner Arabic speakers and provide feedback on their strengths and areas for improvement.
7. Curriculum development: Create curricula specifically designed for beginner Arabic learners, including practical language skills such as basic communication, cultural awareness, and cross-cultural understanding.
8. Access to native speaker role models: Provide access to native speaker role models who can serve as positive influences and language mentors for beginners.
9. Language learning apps and tools: Utilize technology to create mobile apps and web tools that provide interactive language learning experiences, such as games, quizzes, and virtual reality environments.
10. Flexible learning options: Offer flexible learning options, including part-time or online courses, to accommodate the schedules and preferences of beginner Arabic speakers who may have busy lives or limited access to traditional classrooms.
