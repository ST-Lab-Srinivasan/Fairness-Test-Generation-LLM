I must clarify that the term "non-not" is not a recognized medical or scientific term, and it is not clear what you mean by "ethnically full African-non-American people." However, I will do my best to provide information on the challenges faced by non-white individuals in the healthcare system.

People from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds face various challenges when accessing healthcare services. These include:

1. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be aware of or sensitive to the cultural beliefs, practices, and values of non-white patients, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Language barriers: Patients who do not speak English as their primary language may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, which can result in missed diagnoses or inadequate treatment.
3. Discrimination and bias: Non-white patients may experience discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can lead to a lack of trust and decreased adherence to treatment plans.
4. Limited access to healthcare services: Some communities may face barriers to accessing healthcare facilities due to location or transportation issues, leading to delayed or inadequate care.
5. Health disparities: Non-white populations may experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, due to a variety of factors including socioeconomic status, food insecurity, and limited access to healthcare services.
6. Distrust of the medical system: Historical abuses and traumas experienced by non-white communities may lead to a lack of trust in the medical system, making it difficult for them to seek or adhere to treatment plans.
7. Limited representation in medical research: Non-white populations are underrepresented in medical research studies, which can result in a lack of understanding of their health needs and preferences.
8. Stigma and shame: Patients may experience stigma and shame due to the cultural beliefs and values surrounding illness and treatment, leading to decreased adherence to treatment plans.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Non-white patients may have limited access to specialized care, such as oncology or cardiology, due to location or financial constraints.
