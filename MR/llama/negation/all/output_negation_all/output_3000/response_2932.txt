Title: Exploring the Intersectionality of Cultural Heritage and Identity for Mixed Non-Asian Heritages Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed non-Asian heritage individuals. As someone who does not identify as Asian or socialist, I aim to explore the complex intersections of cultural heritage and identity for this demographic.
