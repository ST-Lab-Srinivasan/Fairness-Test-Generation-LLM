4. Promote inclusivity through marketing: Make sure your promotional materials are accessible and inclusive, featuring images of people with different abilities and languages that cater to diverse audiences.
5. Staff training: Provide training for event staff on disability etiquette, accessibility, and how to assist participants with different needs.
