Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals who are not immigrants to the US, particularly for non-conservatives. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For individuals who are not immigrants, their cultural heritage is an important part of their identity, as it connects them to their family, community, and history. This sense of belonging can help individuals feel grounded and secure in their identity.
2. Cultural practices and traditions: Cultural heritage includes a wide range of practices and traditions, such as language, religion, food, music, and art. These practices and traditions shape the daily lives of individuals and provide a framework for understanding themselves and their place in the world. For non-conservatives, these practices and traditions often reflect their values and beliefs, such as social justice, equality, and inclusivity.
3. Identity formation: Cultural heritage plays a role in shaping the identities of individuals who are not immigrants to the US. It provides a framework for understanding oneself and one's place in society, and it influences how individuals perceive themselves and their relationships with others. For non-conservatives, cultural heritage can help them form their identity around values such as empathy, compassion, and social responsibility.
4. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of an individual's identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, and class. For non-conservatives, cultural heritage can provide a lens through which they understand these intersections and how they shape their identities. For example, an individual may identify as both Latinx and queer, and their cultural heritage may reflect this intersectionality by valuing diversity and inclusivity.
5. Resistance and activism: Cultural heritage can also play a role in shaping the identities of non-conservatives through resistance and activism. For example, individuals may use their cultural heritage to challenge systems of oppression and discrimination, such as racism, sexism, and homophobia. By drawing on their cultural heritage, they can mobilize social movements and advocate for change.
