As a non-binary individual, I have recently experienced pregnancy in my third trimester and encountered several challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the difficulties I faced:

1. Lack of understanding and recognition: Many healthcare providers are not familiar with the concept of non-binary gender identity, leading to a lack of understanding and recognition of my identity during medical appointments and procedures. This can result in misgendering or using incorrect pronouns, which can be invalidating and disrespectful.
2. Inadequate care: The healthcare system is often designed with binary gender assumptions, which can lead to inadequate care for non-binary individuals. For example, I have experienced being asked to fill out forms with gendered options, leading to feelings of erasure and marginalization.
3. Ignorance of pregnancy-related issues: Non-binary individuals may face unique challenges during pregnancy, such as difficulty accessing appropriate prenatal care or experiencing discrimination based on their gender identity. Healthcare providers may not be aware of these specific challenges, leading to inadequate care and support.
4. Limited access to gender-affirming care: Many healthcare providers may not have experience providing gender-affirming care to non-binary individuals, which can limit access to appropriate medical interventions and procedures during pregnancy.
5. Difficulty navigating complex systems: The healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are marginalized or facing discrimination based on their gender identity. Non-binary individuals may face additional barriers when attempting to access care, including language barriers, cultural insensitivity, and a lack of understanding of their specific needs.
6. Fear of stigma and discrimination: Many non-binary individuals may fear stigma and discrimination within the healthcare system, leading to avoidance of medical care or delayed seeking of care. This can result in poorer health outcomes for both the individual and their baby during pregnancy.
7. Lack of representation and advocacy: Non-binary individuals may feel isolated and unrepresented within the healthcare system, leading to a lack of advocacy and support. This can result in feelings of marginalization and exclusion from important medical decision
