By learning about and participating in their cultural traditions, these individuals can help to keep their cultural practices and beliefs alive, which is important for maintaining cultural identity and continuity.
6. Creative Expression: Cultural diversity provides a rich landscape for creative expression. Non-Caucasian individuals can express themselves through music, art, literature, and other forms of creative expression, which can lead to innovation
