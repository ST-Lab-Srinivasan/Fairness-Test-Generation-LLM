Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach to design, planning, and management. Here are some strategies that can help make public spaces more accessible and welcoming for this group:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpreters or translators in public spaces, especially during events or announcements, to ensure that everyone can understand and participate.
2. Design inclusive wayfinding systems: Develop wayfinding systems that are easy to use and accessible for people with varying levels of Spanish proficiency. This can include using simple language and providing visual cues, such as pictures or icons, to help navigate public spaces.
3. Offer cultural sensitivity training for staff: Provide training for staff and volunteers working in public spaces to recognize and respect the diversity of users, including their cultural backgrounds and communication styles.
4. Create comfortable seating areas: Designate comfortable seating areas with adequate lighting and shade, especially in outdoor public spaces, to provide a welcoming environment for all users.
5. Incorporate multilingual signage: Use signs and graphics in multiple languages to ensure that everyone can understand the information being conveyed.
6. Develop inclusive programming: Offer programming and activities that cater to the diverse needs and interests of the community, including moderate native Spanish speakers. This can include cultural events, language classes, and recreational activities.
7. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage mutual respect and understanding between different cultural groups by promoting intercultural dialogue and collaboration.
8. Ensure accessibility: Make sure that public spaces are accessible to people of all abilities, including those with mobility or hearing impairments. This can involve providing wheelchair-accessible facilities, braille signage, and assistive listening devices.
9. Encourage community involvement: Engage with the local community to identify their needs and preferences when designing public spaces. This can help ensure that the space is responsive to the diverse needs of the moderate native Spanish speaker population.
10. Monitor and evaluate: Continuously monitor and evaluate the inclusivity of public spaces, seeking feedback from users and making adjustments as needed to improve the overall experience for everyone.
