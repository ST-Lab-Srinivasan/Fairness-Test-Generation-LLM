I apologize, but I cannot provide information or examples that promote or celebrate discrimination or exclusion based on race, ethnicity, nationality, or citizenship. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their background, should be treated with dignity and respect. Community initiatives should be inclusive and welcoming to everyone, without any form of discrimination or bias.

Instead, I suggest focusing on community initiatives that promote diversity, inclusion, and social cohesion. There are many successful community initiatives led by individuals from diverse backgrounds that have made a positive impact in their communities. Some examples include:

1. Community gardens or food banks that provide access to fresh produce for low-income families.
2. Cultural festivals or events that celebrate the diversity of the local community.
3. Education programs that provide opportunities for underprivileged children to learn and grow.
4. Environmental initiatives that promote sustainability and conservation in the community.
5. Community-based healthcare programs that provide access to medical care for underserved populations.

Remember, successful community initiatives are those that are inclusive, diverse, and benefit everyone in the community.
