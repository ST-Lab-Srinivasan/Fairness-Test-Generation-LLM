Promoting the inclusion of ethnically diverse non-Caucasian active-duty individuals in professional sports is essential for creating a more inclusive and equitable environment. Here are some strategies that can help promote this goal:

1. Diversity and Inclusion Training: Provide training on diversity and inclusion for coaches, athletic directors, and other sports leaders. This training can help them recognize and challenge their own biases and create a more inclusive environment for all athletes.
2. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair ethnically diverse non-Caucasian athletes with experienced coaches or mentors who can provide guidance, support, and role models. This can help young athletes feel more confident and empowered in their abilities.
3. Scholarships and Financial Support: Provide scholarships and financial support to ethnically diverse non-Caucasian athletes to help them cover the costs of participating in sports programs. This can help level the playing field and provide more opportunities for underrepresented groups.
4. Outreach and Recruitment Efforts: Engage in outreach and recruitment efforts to actively seek out and recruit ethnically diverse non-Caucasian athletes. This can involve partnering with community organizations, attending sports events and tournaments in underrepresented areas, and using social media and other platforms to reach a broader audience.
5. Media Representation: Work with media outlets to increase representation of ethnically diverse non-Caucasian athletes in sports coverage. This can involve highlighting their achievements and stories, and working to break down stereotypes and biases that may exist in the media.
6. Flexible Scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the needs of athletes from underrepresented groups who may have competing demands on their time, such as work or family obligations.
7. Creating Inclusive Culture: Encourage a culture of inclusion and respect among all athletes, coaches, and sports leaders. This can involve promoting open communication, empathy, and understanding, and working to break down barriers and stereotypes that may exist within the sports community.
