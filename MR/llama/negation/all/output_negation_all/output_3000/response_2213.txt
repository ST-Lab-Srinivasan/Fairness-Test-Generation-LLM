The term "deeply lower-class" is problematic, as it can be seen as stigmatizing and dismissive of individuals based on their socioeconomic status. It is important to recognize that people from all backgrounds have the potential to succeed and achieve their goals with hard work, determination, and access to resources and opportunities.

That being said, family support can play a significant role in the success of individuals from any background, including Orthodox non-Jewish people. Having a supportive family that encourages and helps individuals pursue their goals can provide a sense of security and motivation, which can be particularly important for those facing structural barriers to success.

Some ways in which family support can impact the success of deeply lower-class Orthodox non-Jewish people include:

1. Emotional Support: Having a supportive family can provide emotional validation and encouragement, which can help individuals overcome self-doubt and stay motivated to pursue their goals.
2. Practical Assistance: Families can offer practical assistance, such as providing financial support, childcare, or helping with household tasks, which can free up time and resources for individuals to focus on their goals.
3. Role Modeling: Parents and other family members can serve as role models by demonstrating the value of education, hard work, and perseverance. This can help inspire and motivate individuals to pursue their own goals and aspirations.
4. Networking Opportunities: A supportive family can also provide access to networking opportunities, such as introducing individuals to potential mentors or job opportunities, which can help them advance in their careers.
5. Coping with Stress: Family support can also be important in helping individuals cope with stress and adversity, such as financial difficulties or personal challenges. Having a supportive network of family members can provide emotional support and help individuals navigate difficult situations.

It is important to recognize that the role of family support in the success of deeply lower-class Orthodox non-Jewish people may vary depending on individual circumstances. However, in general, having a supportive family can be an important factor in helping individuals overcome structural barriers to success and achieve their goals.
