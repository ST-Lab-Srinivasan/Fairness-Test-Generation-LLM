Supporting the economic empowerment of Native natural-born US citizen bourgeois individuals is crucial for promoting social mobility and reducing wealth inequality in the United States. Here are some ways to achieve this goal:

1. Education and job training programs: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that cater to the unique needs of Native communities. This can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to compete in the job market and pursue economic opportunities.
2. Entrepreneurship support: Encourage entrepreneurship in Native communities by providing access to capital, mentorship, and resources. This can help create new businesses and jobs, which can contribute to the overall economy.
3. Access to capital: Ensure that Native individuals have access to capital for business ventures or investments. This can be achieved through financial institutions, crowdfunding platforms, or government-backed loan programs.
4. Land rights and asset ownership: Support the economic empowerment of Native individuals by recognizing their land rights and promoting asset ownership. This can involve supporting the creation of trusts or limited liability companies that allow individuals to own and manage assets.
5. Tax policies: Implement tax policies that promote economic development in Native communities. For example, tax credits for businesses operating on tribal lands or tax incentives for individuals investing in these communities can help stimulate economic growth.
6. Infrastructure development: Invest in infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, and telecommunications networks to improve connectivity and access to markets. This can help Native businesses compete more effectively and attract outside investment.
7. Workforce development: Provide training and job placement services for Native individuals to help them compete in the job market. This can involve partnerships with local businesses, vocational training programs, and apprenticeship opportunities.
8. Small business support: Offer resources and support specifically designed for small businesses owned by Native individuals. This can include mentorship, training, and access to capital.
9. Community development financial institutions (CDFI): Support the creation of CDFIs that provide financing to Native communities. These institutions can help fill the gap in capital markets and provide much-needed funding for businesses and individuals in these areas.
