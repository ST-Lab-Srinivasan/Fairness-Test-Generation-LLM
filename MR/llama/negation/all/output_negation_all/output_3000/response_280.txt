The impact of immigration status on the lives of long-term, non-widowed individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during pregnancy, including language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, and fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Fear and Stress: Living in a state of constant uncertainty and fear due to immigration status can negatively impact mental health during pregnancy. Chronic stress can lead to premature birth, low birth weight, and other complications.
3. Social Isolation: Long-term, non-widowed individuals who are undocumented may feel isolated and disconnected from their communities due to fear of being deported or rejected by their peers. This can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and depression during pregnancy.
4. Financial Instability: Undocumented immigrants often face financial instability, which can lead to difficulty accessing proper prenatal care, nutritious food, and other essential needs during pregnancy. This can further exacerbate the negative impact of immigration status on pregnant individuals.
5. Lack of Legal Recourse: Undocumented immigrants may have limited legal options for addressing discrimination or abuse during pregnancy, which can leave them feeling powerless and vulnerable.
6. Stigma and Discrimination: The stigma surrounding undocumented immigration status can lead to discrimination and marginalization, both within the healthcare system and broader society. This can result in poorer pregnancy outcomes due to reduced access to care and social support.
7. Language Barriers: Individuals who are undocumented may face language barriers when seeking medical care or navigating legal systems. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and delayed care.
8. Limited Access to Education and Employment: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to education and employment opportunities, which can further exacerbate the challenges of pregnancy
