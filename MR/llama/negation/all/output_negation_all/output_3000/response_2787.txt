Creating more inclusive social policies for "average earners not in a relationship" (AENIR) individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the heteronormativity of current policies: Many social policies are based on the assumption that everyone is part of a nuclear family. Policies should be reviewed and revised to recognize that not everyone fits this mold, including AENIR individuals.
