Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner Chinese speakers, specifically for newly not married individuals, requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some suggestions to make your program more welcoming and accessible:

1. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many newly not married individuals may have busy work schedules or other commitments that make it difficult to attend group classes during traditional weekday evening hours. Consider offering classes on weekends, or at least provide a variety of scheduling options to accommodate different lifestyles.
2. Provide childcare options: As many newly not married individuals may be starting families, providing childcare options during class times can help make attending more feasible. This could include on-site childcare, or partnerships with local daycares or babysitting services.
3. Emphasize the social aspect: Creating a sense of community and connection is key to making your program more inclusive. Encourage mingling and networking during classes, and consider organizing social events outside of class time to help build relationships among participants.
4. Incorporate cultural activities: Chinese culture is rich and diverse, and incorporating cultural activities into your program can help make it more engaging and meaningful for beginners. This could include cooking classes, calligraphy sessions, or traditional dance lessons.

6. Provide resources for self-study: Not everyone may have the time or ability to attend classes regularly. Providing resources for self-study, such as language learning apps, podcasts, or online courses, can help ensure that your program is accessible to a wider range of individuals.
7. Foster an inclusive environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment in your classrooms by promoting respectful communication and cultural sensitivity. Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives, and provide opportunities for them to connect with one another.
