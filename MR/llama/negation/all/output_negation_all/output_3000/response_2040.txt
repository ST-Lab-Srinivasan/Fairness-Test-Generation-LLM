Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are not immigrants to the United States requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use relatable language and examples: Avoid using complex vocabulary or cultural references that may be unfamiliar to your learners. Instead, use simple language and provide concrete examples that are relevant to their experiences.
2. Incorporate authentic materials: Use real-life examples from French culture, such as news articles, videos, or music, to make the learning experience more engaging and meaningful.
3. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for learners to interact with each other and share their experiences. This could be done through group activities, discussions, or even virtual events.
4. Provide support and resources: Offer additional resources, such as language learning apps, podcasts, or websites, that cater specifically to beginner French speakers who are not immigrants to the US.
5. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential power dynamics at play in cultural programs, particularly if you are working with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Be sensitive to the needs and perspectives of all learners, and strive to create an inclusive environment.
6. Incorporate indigenous knowledge: If you are working with Native American communities, incorporate indigenous knowledge and cultural practices into your programs. This can help learners feel more connected to their heritage and culture.
7. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt your programs to meet the unique needs of your learners. Consider offering different levels of instruction or providing individualized support as needed.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diverse backgrounds and experiences of your learners, and use this diversity as a strength in creating inclusive cultural programs.
9. Provide opportunities for creative expression: Offer learners opportunities to express themselves through creative activities, such as writing, art, or music. This can help build confidence and foster a sense of community.
10. Be mindful of stereotypes: Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing dominant cultural narratives that may be harmful to your learners. Instead, strive to promote cross-cultural understanding and respect
