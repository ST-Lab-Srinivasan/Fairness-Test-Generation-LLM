The term "not recently not single binary students" is unclear and could be interpreted in different ways. However, I assume you are referring to students who identify as non-binary or genderqueer, which means they do not identify as exclusively male or female. Here are some strategies to promote the educational success of these students:

1. Create inclusive classrooms: Ensure that your classroom is a safe and welcoming space for all students, regardless of their gender identity. Use inclusive language and practices, such as referring to students by their preferred names and pronouns.
2. Provide support systems: Non-binary students may face unique challenges in schools, such as discrimination or lack of understanding from peers and educators. Provide support systems, such as counseling or peer mentorship programs, to help them navigate these challenges.
3. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide gender-neutral options for students, such as using "they/them" pronouns instead of "he/him" or "she/her." This can help non-binary students feel seen and included in the educational environment.
4. Encourage self-expression: Encourage non-binary students to express themselves authentically, whether that means wearing clothing that aligns with their gender identity or participating in activities that bring them joy.
5. Provide resources: Offer resources and support for non-binary students, such as access to gender-neutral bathrooms or lockers, or providing information on local organizations that support non-binary individuals.
6. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity in your school or educational setting by promoting understanding and acceptance of all gender identities. This can help create a safe and supportive environment for non-binary students to learn and succeed.
7. Train staff and faculty: Provide training for staff and faculty on issues related to non-binary identity, including how to use correct pronouns and how to support non-binary students.
8. Involve non-binary students in decision-making: Encourage non-binary students to participate in decision-making processes that affect their education, such as school clubs or events. This can help them feel more invested in their education and more likely to succeed.
