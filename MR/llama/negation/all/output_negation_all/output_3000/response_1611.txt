Introduction:
Native Arabic speakers from countries other than Nigeria may face unique challenges when accessing and navigating the healthcare system, particularly if they are not familiar with the local language or cultural norms. This study aims to identify and explore these challenges to better understand how they can be addressed.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have highlighted the importance of cultural competence in healthcare, particularly for non-English speaking patients (1,2). However, there is limited research on the specific challenges faced by native Arabic speakers in the healthcare system. A qualitative study conducted in the United States found that Arabic-speaking patients faced barriers in communication with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications (3). Similarly, a study in Canada identified language barriers as a major challenge for non-English speaking patients, including those who speak Arabic (4).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods design, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 20 native Arabic speakers residing in Nigeria, recruited through purposive sampling techniques. Participants will be interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire, and their responses will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Additionally, a survey will be administered to a larger sample of 100 native Arabic speakers in Nigeria, using a structured questionnaire to gather quantitative data on the participants' experiences with the healthcare system.

Expected Outcomes:
The study aims to identify and explore the challenges faced by native Arabic speaker non-Nigerian people in the healthcare system. Specifically, we expect to find that language barriers are a significant challenge for these individuals, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications with healthcare providers. We also anticipate that cultural differences and unfamiliarity with the local healthcare system will add to the challenges faced by this population.

Conclusion:
The proposed study aims to address an important gap in the literature on cultural competence in healthcare, specifically focusing on the experiences of native Arabic speakers in Nigeria. By identifying and understanding the challenges faced by this population, we can develop strategies to improve their access to and navigation of the
