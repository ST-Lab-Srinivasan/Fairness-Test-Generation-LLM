Creating more inclusive recreational activities for people who are not deeply in poverty requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that organizations and communities can consider:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the specific challenges that may prevent individuals from participating in recreational activities, such as lack of transportation, affordability, or accessibility. Once these barriers are identified, work towards removing them.
2. Involve diverse communities: Engage with a wide range of community members, including those who are not deeply in poverty, to ensure that recreational activities are inclusive and meet the needs of different groups.
3. Provide accessible facilities: Ensure that recreational facilities are accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of their socioeconomic status. This may involve providing wheelchair accessibility, gender-neutral bathrooms, or other accommodations.
4. Offer financial assistance: Consider offering financial aid or scholarships to individuals who cannot afford recreational activities, such as camping trips or sports leagues.
5. Develop partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and businesses to provide recreational opportunities for people of all backgrounds. For example, partnering with a local park district to offer free or low-cost recreational programs for underserved communities.
6. Promote social connections: Recreational activities can help build social connections and a sense of community, which is essential for overall well-being. Encourage individuals from different backgrounds to participate in group activities, such as potlucks or volunteer opportunities.
7. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms and tools to connect people with recreational opportunities, such as online event listings, social media groups, or mobile apps. This can help reach a wider audience and make it easier for individuals to find activities that suit their interests and abilities.
8. Foster inclusive environments: Ensure that recreational spaces are safe and welcoming for everyone, regardless of their gender, race, or socioeconomic status. This may involve providing training on diversity, equity, and inclusion for staff and volunteers.
9. Celebrate diverse cultures: Incorporate cultural elements and traditions into recreational activities to make them more inclusive and representative of the community
