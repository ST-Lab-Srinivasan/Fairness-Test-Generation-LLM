As a non-binary, slightly not bisexual individual, I can attest to the significant role that cultural heritage plays in shaping my identity. Growing up, I was exposed to various cultural influences that contributed to my understanding of myself and my place within society. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage has influenced my identity:

1. Family traditions: My family is from a culturally diverse background, with roots in multiple countries and ethnicities.
