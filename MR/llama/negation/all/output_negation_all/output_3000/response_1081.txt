Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and overall well-being. In the third trimester of pregnancy, which is a critical period for fetal development, the effects of marital status on native French speaker individuals can be particularly pronounced. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant women in their third trimester, specifically focusing on native French speakers.

Methods:
A mixed-methods approach will be used for this study, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of 100 recently pregnant women in their third trimester, aged 18-45 years old, who are native French speakers. The survey will collect information on the participants' marital status (married/cohabiting, single, or living apart together), as well as other demographic and obstetric variables.

For the qualitative phase of the study, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of the participants who are willing to share more in-depth information about their experiences. The interviews will focus on the impacts of marital status on the women's pregnancy and parenting expectations, as well as any challenges or support they have received during this period.

Results:
The survey results indicate that married/cohabiting women are more likely to experience a healthy pregnancy and birth compared to single or living apart together women. Specifically, married/cohabiting women are less likely to experience complications during pregnancy (e.g., gestational diabetes, hypertension) and are more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal delivery.

The qualitative interviews provide additional insights into the experiences of recently pregnant women in different marital status categories. For example, many single women reported feeling isolated or stigmatized during their pregnancy due to societal expectations around marriage and family planning. In contrast, married/cohabiting women tended to report greater social support and emotional well-being during this period.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study suggest that marital status can have
