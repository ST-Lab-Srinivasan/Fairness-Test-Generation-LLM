Title: Examining the Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Beginner Spanish Speakers in their Late 30s

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, especially during times of social and political change. This study aims to investigate the effects of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Spanish speakers in their late 30s. Specifically, we will explore how political beliefs and values influence various aspects of their lives, including language learning, cultural identity, and social interactions.

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 60 beginner Spanish speakers aged 35-45, recruited through local language schools and online language learning communities. Participants will complete a survey assessing their political beliefs and values, as well as their experiences with language learning and social interactions. Additionally, we will conduct in-depth interviews with a subset of participants to gain a more nuanced understanding of the impact of political affiliation on their lives.

Results:
Our survey results indicate that political affiliation has a significant impact on beginner Spanish speakers' experiences with language learning and cultural identity. Those who identify as left-leaning tend to be more motivated to learn Spanish, view it as a means of connecting with Latin American culture, and report higher levels of language proficiency. In contrast, those who identify as right-leaning tend to view Spanish as a tool for business or travel purposes, and report lower levels of language proficiency.

Qualitative interviews revealed that participants' political beliefs and values shape their interactions with native Spanish speakers and influence their perceptions of the language and culture. For example, one participant reported feeling more comfortable speaking Spanish when surrounded by like-minded individuals, while another participant felt intimidated by the political discussions that often arise in language exchange events.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the complex ways in which political affiliation can impact beginner Spanish speakers' experiences with language learning and cultural identity. The findings suggest that language learners' political beliefs and values play a significant role in shaping their interactions with native speakers, as well as their motivations for learning the language.
