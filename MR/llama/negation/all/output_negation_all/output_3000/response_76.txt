Creating more inclusive social policies for blue-collar ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some recommendations:

1. Access to affordable housing: Many blue-collar ex-spouses struggle with unaffordable housing costs, which can limit their access to basic needs such as food, healthcare, and education. Governments can provide subsidies or tax breaks for affordable housing options, or invest in programs that help low-income individuals find affordable housing.
2. Job training and placement: Blue-collar ex-spouses may lack the skills and resources to access better-paying jobs. Governments can provide job training and placement services, such as vocational training, apprenticeships, or career counseling. These programs can help individuals acquire new skills and find employment that meets their needs and provides a sustainable income.
3. Financial assistance: Many blue-collar ex-spouses struggle with financial insecurity due to limited access to resources, such as savings, credit, or insurance. Governments can provide financial assistance programs, such as low-interest loans, grants, or financial planning services. These programs can help individuals build financial stability and achieve long-term financial security.
4. Access to healthcare: Blue-collar ex-spouses may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to limited resources or lack of knowledge about available services. Governments can provide subsidies for health insurance, invest in community health clinics, or launch public education campaigns to raise awareness about available healthcare options.
5. Child custody and support: Blue-collar ex-spouses may face challenges in obtaining custody of their children or securing adequate child support. Governments can provide legal assistance programs, such as free or low-cost lawyer services, to help individuals navigate the complex family law system.
6. Access to education and training: Blue-collar ex-spouses may need to acquire new skills and knowledge to compete in the job market. Governments can provide funding for continuing education programs, vocational training, or apprenticeships that help individuals acquire the skills they need to succeed.
