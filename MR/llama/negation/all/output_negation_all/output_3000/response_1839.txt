Creating more inclusive community events for non-average income earners requires careful consideration of their needs and perspectives. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Offer financial assistance: Provide scholarships, discounted tickets or free admission for individuals who cannot afford the event's regular price. This can include low-income families, students, seniors, and other marginalized groups.
2. Adapt venues and activities: Ensure that the venue is accessible and comfortable for everyone, including those with disabilities. Offer activities that cater to diverse interests and abilities, such as art exhibitions, live music performances, or interactive workshops.
3. Promote diversity in marketing: Use inclusive language and imagery in your promotional materials, featuring people from different backgrounds, ages, genders, and abilities. Highlight the importance of representation and inclusion.
4. Provide childcare services: Offer free or low-cost childcare services during events to help parents with limited financial resources attend without worrying about their children's care.
5. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with community groups, non-profits, or social service agencies that serve underrepresented populations. They can provide valuable support and help promote your event to their networks.
6. Offer flexible pricing options: Consider offering tiered pricing based on income level or other factors. This can make the event more accessible to people who may not have the same financial means as others.
7. Host events outside of traditional work hours: Schedule events during non-peak hours, such as weekends or evening times, to accommodate those with varying work schedules, including students, artists, and caregivers.
8. Encourage volunteer involvement: Recruit volunteers from underrepresented groups to help plan, organize, and staff your event. This can create a sense of ownership and inclusivity among these groups.
9. Provide translation services: Offer interpretation or translation services during events for attendees who may not speak the dominant language in your area. This can include sign language interpreters for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
10. Create an inclusive environment: Train event staff and volunteers
