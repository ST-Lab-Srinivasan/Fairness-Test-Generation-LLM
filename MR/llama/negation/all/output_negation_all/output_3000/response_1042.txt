Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for non-resident Native Americans and other marginalized populations:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they build trust and rapport with their patients. This is particularly important for marginalized populations who may have had negative experiences with the medical system in the past.
2. Better diagnosis and treatment: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers understand the social and cultural factors that influence a patient's health. For example, a provider may recognize that a patient's illness is related to their cultural beliefs or practices, such as traditional healing methods, and provide appropriate treatment.
3. Enhanced communication: Cultural competence promotes effective communication between healthcare providers and patients from diverse backgrounds. Providers can use interpreters or translators to communicate with patients who speak different languages, but they must also be able to understand the cultural nuances of communication.
4. Reduced health disparities: Cultural competence can help reduce health disparities by identifying and addressing cultural barriers to healthcare access. For example, a provider may recognize that a patient's lack of access to healthcare is related to their cultural beliefs or practices, such as the fear of hospitals or the belief that traditional healing methods are more effective.
5. Increased cultural awareness: Cultural competence training can increase providers' awareness of their own biases and assumptions, as well as those of their patients. This can lead to more culturally sensitive care and better outcomes for patients.
6. More inclusive care: Cultural competence promotes the inclusion of marginalized populations in healthcare decision-making processes. Providers can work with community leaders or patient advocates to ensure that the needs and preferences of these populations are taken into account when developing treatment plans.
7. Better management of cultural differences: Cultural competence training can help providers manage cultural differences in a way that promotes mutual respect and understanding. For example, a provider may recognize that a patient's dietary restrictions are related to their cultural beliefs and practices, and provide appropriate accommodations.
