Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native non-English speaker Native Americans who are not immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve Native community members in program development and implementation: It is essential to involve Native community members in the design and delivery of cultural programs. This ensures that the programs are culturally relevant, authentic, and respectful of Native traditions and values.
2. Offer programs in native languages: Providing cultural programs in native languages can help ensure that all participants feel included and valued. This can be done by hiring interpreters or providing translated materials.
3. Foster intergenerational connections: Connecting Native youth with their elders can help preserve traditional knowledge and cultural practices. Consider hosting events that bring together younger and older generations, such as traditional dance classes or storytelling sessions.
4. Create opportunities for cultural expression: Provide spaces for Native individuals to express themselves through art, music, dance, or other forms of creative expression. This can help build confidence and self-esteem while fostering a sense of community.
5. Respect and acknowledge the diversity of Native cultures: Recognize that there is no single "Native American" culture, but rather a diverse array of cultures and traditions within the indigenous communities. Be mindful of this diversity when designing programs and strive to be inclusive of all Native cultures.
6. Incorporate traditional practices and beliefs: Incorporating traditional practices and beliefs into cultural programs can help create a sense of belonging and connection to one's heritage. Examples include incorporating traditional medicinal practices, ceremonies, or rituals into program offerings.
7. Offer programs in non-traditional settings: Consider offering cultural programs outside of the typical museum or cultural center setting. For example, partnering with local schools, community centers, or outdoor spaces to provide programming that is accessible and convenient for Native communities.
8. Provide educational resources: Offer educational resources, such as books, films, or workshops, that provide insight into the history, culture, and traditions of Native communities. This can help create a more informed and empathetic audience for cultural programs.
9. Collaborate with local organizations:
