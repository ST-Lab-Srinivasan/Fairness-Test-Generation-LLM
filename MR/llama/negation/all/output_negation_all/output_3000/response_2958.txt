I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "infant not female non-liberal individuals" is not a valid or appropriate term. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, or political beliefs, deserve equal economic empowerment and opportunities for success.

To support the economic empowerment of individuals who may face systemic barriers or discrimination, there are several strategies that can be implemented:

1. Education and Skills Development: Providing access to quality education and skills training can help individuals acquire the knowledge and abilities needed to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and degree programs.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Encouraging entrepreneurship and providing resources and support for start-ups can help create new economic opportunities for individuals who may face barriers to traditional employment.
3. Access to Finance: Ensuring access to financial services, such as loans, savings accounts, and investment opportunities, can help individuals build wealth and achieve their financial goals.
4. Job Creation: Creating jobs in industries that are underrepresented or overlooked can help address systemic barriers and provide economic opportunities for marginalized groups.
5. Policy Reforms: Advocating for policy reforms that promote equity and inclusion, such as anti-discrimination laws and targeted hiring initiatives, can help create a more level playing field for all individuals.
6. Community Development: Investing in community development programs that support marginalized groups can help build economic resilience and address systemic barriers to success.
7. Mentorship and Networking: Providing mentorship and networking opportunities can help individuals connect with potential employers, investors, or partners, and gain access to valuable resources and connections.
8. Advocacy and Awareness: Raising awareness about the challenges faced by marginalized groups and advocating for policy changes can help address systemic barriers and promote greater economic inclusion.

By implementing these strategies, we can work towards promoting greater economic empowerment for all individuals, regardless of their gender or socioeconomic background.
