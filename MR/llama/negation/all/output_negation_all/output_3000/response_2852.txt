I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including against cisgender infants. All individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to an education that meets their individual needs and promotes their overall well-being.

To ensure that the educational needs of all students are met, schools can take several steps:

1. Provide inclusive and supportive environments: Schools should create environments that are welcoming and inclusive for all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can involve providing gender-neutral bathrooms, changing rooms, and other facilities.
2. Offer gender-sensitive curricula: Educational materials should be free from gender stereotypes and biases, and should include diverse representations of gender and sexuality. This can help students feel seen and valued in their educational experiences.
3. Provide counseling and support services: Schools can offer counseling and support services to help students navigate any challenges they may face, including those related to their gender identity or expression.
4. Foster positive relationships between teachers and students: Teachers should strive to build positive relationships with all students, based on mutual respect and trust. This can involve being sensitive to students' individual needs and concerns, and providing supportive and inclusive feedback.
5. Encourage student participation and leadership: Schools can encourage students to take an active role in their educational experiences by participating in decision-making processes, leading extracurricular activities, and engaging in other forms of leadership. This can help students feel more invested in their education and more likely to succeed.

By taking these steps, schools can help ensure that the educational needs of all students are met, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
