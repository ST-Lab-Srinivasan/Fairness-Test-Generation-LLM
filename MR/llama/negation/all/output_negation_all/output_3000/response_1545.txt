Family support plays a crucial role in the success of early adolescents (ages 13-15) who are not mentally disabled. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to their success:

1. Emotional Support: Adolescence can be a challenging time for young people, both physically and emotionally. Having a supportive family can help them navigate these challenges by providing emotional support, encouragement, and validation of their feelings.
2. Practical Support: Families can provide practical support by helping with homework, transportation, and other daily tasks. This can help reduce stress and free up time for young people to focus on their interests and activities.
3. Role Modeling: Parents and other family members can serve as role models for early adolescents. By demonstrating positive values, such as hard work, responsibility, and resilience, they can inspire their children to adopt these values and behaviors.
4. Socialization: Family support can also provide opportunities for socialization, which is essential for young people's cognitive, emotional, and social development. By spending time with family members, early adolescents can learn important life skills, such as communication, conflict resolution, and empathy.
5. Building Self-Esteem: When family members show appreciation and support for a young person's achievements and interests, it can help build their self-esteem and confidence. This can motivate them to set goals and work towards achieving them.
6. Providing Resources: Families can provide access to resources that can help early adolescents develop new skills and interests. For example, they may offer music lessons, sports equipment, or other activities that can enhance their development.
7. Encouraging Independence: As young people transition into adolescence, they begin to develop a sense of independence. Families can support this by giving them increasing responsibility for managing their own lives and making decisions about their future.
8. Facilitating Communication: Family support can also facilitate communication between young people and their parents or other family members. By creating a safe and open environment for discussion, families can help early adolescents develop effective communication skills and build stronger relationships.
9. Promoting Resilience:
