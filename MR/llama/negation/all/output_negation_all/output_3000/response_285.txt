Ensuring the financial needs of over 90 years old non-immigrant, natural-born US citizens can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Social Security: This is a critical source of income for many seniors. Ensure that you or your loved one is enrolled in the program and receiving the full benefits they are entitled to. You can visit the Social Security Administration website (ssa.gov) or call 1-800-772-1213 to learn more.
2. Retirement Accounts: If you have a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA, consider taking withdrawals to cover living expenses. However, be aware of the tax implications and potential penalties for early withdrawals.
3. Pension Plans: If your loved one is entitled to a pension through their former employer or a private pension plan, make sure they are receiving the full benefit. Contact the pension administrator or review the pension plan documentation to ensure you understand the terms of the plan.
4. Annuities: Consider purchasing an annuity to provide a steady income stream in retirement. This can help ensure financial security, especially for those who do not have a guaranteed source of income.
5. Home Equity: If your loved one owns their home, consider using the equity to secure a reverse mortgage or a home equity loan/line of credit. This can provide a tax-free lump sum or ongoing income stream. However, be aware of the costs and potential risks associated with these products.
6. Other Sources of Income: Explore other sources of income, such as rental properties, stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. These can provide additional streams of income to help cover living expenses in retirement.
7. Budgeting and Expense Management: Help your loved one manage their finances by creating a budget that accounts for all necessary expenses, such as housing, food, healthcare, and transportation. Encourage them to prioritize essential expenses and cut back on non-essential spending.
8. Financial Planning: Consult with a financial advisor or planner who specializes in working with seniors. They
