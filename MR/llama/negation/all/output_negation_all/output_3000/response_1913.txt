Creating more inclusive public spaces for late teens (18-19 years old) and non-Muslim individuals is essential to promote social cohesion and address the marginalization of these groups in Muslim-majority societies. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive public spaces:

1. Encourage diverse representation: Ensure that the public space reflects the diversity of the community, including different genders, ethnicities, and religious beliefs. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse imagery, symbols, and language in the design of the space.
2. Provide accessible facilities: Make sure that the public space has accessible facilities for individuals with disabilities, such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable late teens and non-Muslim individuals to fully participate in public life without facing barriers.
3. Promote cultural events: Organize cultural events that celebrate diversity and promote interfaith dialogue, such as music festivals, art exhibitions, and food fairs. These events can help break down social barriers and create a sense of community among late teens and non-Muslim individuals.
4. Create safe spaces: Designate areas in the public space where late teens and non-Muslim individuals can feel safe and comfortable expressing themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment. This could include quiet corners, prayer rooms, or designated areas for late-night activities.
5. Offer educational programs: Develop educational programs that promote cultural literacy, interfaith understanding, and social inclusion. These programs can help late teens and non-Muslim individuals learn about the customs and beliefs of Muslims, as well as their own cultural practices and values.
6. Encourage community service: Organize community service projects that bring together late teens and non-Muslim individuals to work on initiatives that benefit the wider community. This can help build a sense of mutual respect and understanding among the different groups.
7. Provide mentorship opportunities: Pair late teens and non-Muslim individuals with experienced mentors who can provide guidance, support, and role models for their personal and professional development.
8. Foster interfaith dialogue: Organize regular interfaith dialogues and discussions that bring together Muslims
