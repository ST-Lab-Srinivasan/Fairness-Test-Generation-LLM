Supporting the economic empowerment of Native American communities, particularly those who are not immigrants to the US and are living in deep poverty, is crucial for addressing the persistent disparities and inequities that exist within these communities. Here are some ways to support their economic empowerment:

1. Provide access to financial services: Many Native American communities lack access to traditional banking services, making it difficult for them to save money, get loans, or start businesses. Consider partnering with local organizations to provide financial literacy programs, mobile banking services, or microfinance initiatives.
2. Foster entrepreneurship and job creation: Encourage Native American youth to pursue entrepreneurial ventures by providing training, mentorship, and access to capital. This could involve creating business incubators, accelerators, or funding programs specifically tailored for Native American-owned businesses.
3. Promote sustainable economic development: Support initiatives that promote sustainable economic development in Native American communities, such as renewable energy projects, sustainable agriculture practices, and eco-tourism initiatives. This can help create jobs and generate income while also preserving the cultural heritage of these communities.
4. Address systemic barriers: Many Native American communities face systemic barriers to economic empowerment, such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job training, and limited infrastructure. Advocate for policies that address these barriers and create a more level playing field for Native American entrepreneurs.
5. Support community-led development: Empower local Native American communities to drive their own economic development by providing technical assistance, capacity-building programs, and access to resources. This can help build trust and ownership in the development process, leading to more sustainable and inclusive economic growth.
6. Foster collaboration and partnerships: Encourage collaborations between Native American communities, government agencies, private sector organizations, and civil society groups to address shared economic challenges. This could involve co-creating solutions, sharing expertise, or jointly investing in infrastructure and community development projects.
7. Invest in education and job training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs for Native American youth and adults. This can help build a more skilled workforce
