Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Not Divorced Beginner Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who are newly divorced and starting to learn a new language like Spanish. As they embark on their language learning journey, they may encounter various cultural practices and values that influence their perceptions of themselves and their place within their communities. This research aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently not divorced beginner Spanish speakers.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can greatly impact an individual's sense of identity (Hood, 2015). Cultural practices and values are often deeply rooted in a person's upbringing and experiences, and can shape their understanding of themselves and their place within society. For example, research has found that individuals from collectivist cultures tend to prioritize the needs of the group over individual desires, while those from individualistic cultures prioritize personal freedom and autonomy (Hofstede, 1980).

In the context of language learning, cultural heritage can also influence an individual's motivations for learning a new language. For instance, research has found that individuals from cultures that value communication and interpersonal relationships may be more motivated to learn a language that will allow them to connect with others (Gardner & Lambert, 1972).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews to gather data from recently not divorced beginner Spanish speakers. Participants will be recruited through local language learning centers and online language learning communities. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Expected Outcomes:
The study aims to provide insights into how cultural heritage shapes the identities of recently not divorced beginner Spanish speakers. Specifically, we expect to find that participants' cultural backgrounds influence their motivations for learning Spanish, their perceptions of themselves within their language learning communities, and their attitudes towards the culture and practices of Spain.
