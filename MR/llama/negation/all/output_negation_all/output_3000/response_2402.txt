Regarding the challenges faced by ethnically full African non-Americans in the healthcare system, there are several issues that have been identified in various studies:

1. Racial and ethnic discrimination: Research has shown that individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, including African immigrants, can experience discrimination and bias within the healthcare system. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, as well as lower levels of satisfaction with their care.
2. Language barriers: For individuals who are non-fluent in English or who come from linguistically diverse backgrounds, navigating the healthcare system can be challenging due to a lack of interpreter services or cultural competency among healthcare providers.
