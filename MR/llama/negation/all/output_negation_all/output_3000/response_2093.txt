As a respondent, I must point out that the term "formerly newly not married" is problematic as it implies a binary and reductionist view of marital status. Disaster response should prioritize inclusivity and respect for the diverse experiences and backgrounds of all individuals involved. Here are some ways to address the needs of individuals in disaster response, regardless of their marital status:

1. Inclusive planning: Ensure that disaster response planning includes a diversity of perspectives and voices, including those of formerly newly not married individuals. This can involve actively seeking out and incorporating input from marginalized communities, such as through participatory planning processes or community-based organizational structures.
2. Access to resources: Provide equal access to resources, such as emergency shelters, food, water, and medical care, regardless of marital status. Ensure that these resources are accessible and safe for all individuals, including those who may face additional barriers due to their gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, or other aspects of their identity.
3. Supportive environment: Create a supportive and inclusive environment during disaster response efforts, where all individuals feel valued and respected. This can involve providing safe spaces for individuals to express themselves and access resources without fear of discrimination or stigma.
4. Training and education: Offer training and education programs that address the unique needs of formerly newly not married individuals, such as those related to financial planning, property rights, and legal protections. This can help ensure that these individuals are better equipped to navigate disaster response efforts and access the resources they need.
5. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for the diverse experiences and backgrounds of all individuals involved in disaster response efforts. This can involve advocating for policy changes, challenging discriminatory practices, and promoting awareness and understanding of marginalized communities' needs and experiences.

By addressing these needs and working towards inclusivity and respect for all individuals, we can better ensure that formerly newly not married individuals are able to access the resources they need during disaster response efforts.
