Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are in the early stages of pregnancy. The first trimester of pregnancy is a critical period for fetal development, and any disruptions to the mother's health or well-being during this time can have lasting effects on the baby's growth and development.
