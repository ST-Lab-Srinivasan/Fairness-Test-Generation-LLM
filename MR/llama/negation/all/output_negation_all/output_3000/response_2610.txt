Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Happily Long-Time Unmarried Native Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly when it comes to their sense of self and belonging. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of happily long-time unmarried native Spanish speakers. We will explore how cultural heritage influences their values, beliefs, and practices, and how these factors contribute to their overall identity.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can shape individuals' identities in various ways. For example, research has found that cultural heritage can influence an individual's sense of self-esteem and confidence (Gao & Gao, 2015). Additionally, cultural heritage can also affect an individual's worldview and belief system (Hood, 2009).

Methodology:
To conduct this study, we recruited a sample of 30 happily long-time unmarried native Spanish speakers aged between 25 and 65 years old. Participants were selected using purposive sampling, ensuring diversity in terms of age, gender, and geographical location. We conducted semi-structured interviews with each participant, which were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
Our findings revealed that cultural heritage played a significant role in shaping the identities of the participants. Most participants reported that their cultural heritage influenced their values, beliefs, and practices, which in turn contributed to their overall identity. For example, many participants mentioned that their cultural heritage had taught them the importance of family and community, which were central to their sense of self and belonging.

Furthermore, we found that cultural heritage also influenced participants' attitudes towards marriage and relationships. While some participants saw marriage as a necessary aspect of life, others viewed it as less important, citing cultural norms and values that prioritized family and community over individualism.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the significant role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of happily long-time unmarried native Spanish speakers. Cultural
