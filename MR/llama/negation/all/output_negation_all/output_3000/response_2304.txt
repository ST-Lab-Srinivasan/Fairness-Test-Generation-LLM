As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to approach the topic of supporting devout practicing non-Hindu advanced just turned 65 (or over 85) communities with sensitivity and respect for their beliefs and practices. Here are some effective strategies that can be adopted:

1. Listen and Learn: Listening actively and learning about the community's beliefs, values, and practices is crucial in supporting them. Be open-minded and non-judgmental, and avoid making assumptions or imposing your own beliefs on them.
2. Respect their Autonomy: Recognize that the community has the right to self-determine and make decisions about their own affairs. Avoid pressuring them into adopting certain practices or beliefs that go against their values and traditions.
3. Provide Access to Resources: Offer access to resources such as healthcare, education, and social services that can help improve the quality of life for community members. Be mindful of any cultural or religious sensitivities when providing these resources.
4. Foster Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in decision-making processes. This can help build trust and a sense of ownership among community members, and ensure that their voices are heard.
5. Promote Interfaith Dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and collaboration between different religious groups to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can help break down barriers and foster greater tolerance and acceptance.
6. Advocate for their Rights: Advocate for the rights of the community, including their right to practice their religion freely and without discrimination. Work with other stakeholders to promote policies and laws that protect the rights of minority religious groups.
7. Provide Spiritual Support: Offer spiritual support and guidance to community members who may be facing challenges or difficulties in their lives. This can include providing access to religious leaders or counselors, as well as offering prayer or meditation services.
8. Celebrate their Culture: Celebrate the cultural heritage and traditions of the community, including their religious practices. Promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation by organizing events that showcase their culture and traditions.
