Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African-non-American non-conservative individuals. Mixed race individuals often navigate between different cultural worlds, and their cultural identity is shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including their ancestry, upbringing, and personal experiences. This essay will explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed African-non-American non-conservative individuals and the challenges they face in navigating between different cultural spaces.

Mixed race individuals often have multiple cultural identities, which can create a sense of fragmentation or dislocation. They may feel that they don't fully belong to any one culture, leading to feelings of insecurity or ambiguity about their identity (Hood, 2016).
