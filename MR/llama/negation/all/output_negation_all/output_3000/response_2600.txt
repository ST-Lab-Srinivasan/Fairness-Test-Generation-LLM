As a native French speaker who has just turned 65, there are several challenges that you may face in the healthcare system. Here are some of them:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: As an elderly person, you may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to mobility issues or lack of transportation options.
2. Language barrier: Depending on where you live, you may encounter language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers who are not fluent in French.

4. Lack of geriatric care training: Many healthcare providers receive limited training in caring for older adults, which can result in inadequate care and support.
