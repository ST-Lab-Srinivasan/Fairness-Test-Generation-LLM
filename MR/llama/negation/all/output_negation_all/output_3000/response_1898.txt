Promoting the cultural preservation of ultra-conservative, advanced over 90 years old (and over 85 years old) communities can be challenging due to several factors. Here are some strategies that could be effective:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Organize community events, workshops, and cultural activities that cater to the older adults' interests and needs. This will help create a sense of belonging and foster intergenerational connections.
2. Oral History Projects: Collect and document the stories and experiences of older adults in the community. This can be done through one-on-one interviews, group sessions, or workshops. The collected stories can be preserved in the form of books, audio recordings, or digital archives.
3. Traditional Arts and Crafts: Encourage the older adults to continue practicing their traditional arts and crafts, such as embroidery, pottery, or woodcarving. This will help preserve their cultural heritage and pass on these skills to younger generations.
4. Language and Literature: Promote the use of the community's traditional language and literature among older adults. Organize language classes, book clubs, or storytelling sessions to keep the language alive and encourage intergenerational exchange.
5. Cultural Education: Offer educational programs that focus on the community's cultural history, traditions, and practices. This can include workshops, lectures, or interactive exhibits that cater to older adults' interests and abilities.
6. Intergenerational Collaboration: Pair older adults with younger generations for collaborative projects, such as art exhibitions, musical performances, or community service events. This will foster mutual understanding and respect between different age groups.
7. Access to Technology: Provide access to technology that can help preserve the community's cultural heritage, such as digital archives, audio-visual equipment, or software for documenting and sharing stories.
8. Community Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations, schools, or museums to promote the community's cultural heritage. This can include exhibitions, workshops, or events that showcase the community's traditions and practices.
9. Capacity Building: Offer training and capacity-building
