The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Chinese speakers who are not young adults (aged 20s) can be significant, as it can affect their social interactions, career opportunities, and overall well-being. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social Interactions: In China, political affiliation can play a role in social interactions, particularly among older generations. For example, elderly people may be hesitant to associate with individuals who hold opposing political views, out of fear of being ostracized or losing face within their community. This can limit the opportunities for social interaction and community engagement among native Chinese speakers who hold different political beliefs.
2. Career Opportunities: In some industries, such as government, media, or education, political affiliation can influence career advancement. For example, individuals with strong Communist Party ties may have an advantage in securing top positions within these fields. This can create barriers for native Chinese speakers who are not members of the Communist Party and may limit their career opportunities.
3. Access to Information: The government tightly controls access to information in China, and political affiliation can influence an individual's ability to access certain information or resources. For example, individuals with connections to the ruling party may have greater access to official documents, research materials, or other resources that are not available to the general public.
4. Personal Freedom: Political affiliation can also impact an individual's personal freedom and autonomy. For example, native Chinese speakers who hold dissenting political views may face surveillance or harassment from government authorities, which can limit their ability to express themselves freely.

6. Social Identity: Political affiliation can shape an individual's social identity and sense of belonging within their community. For example, native Chinese speakers who are not members of the Communist Party may feel marginalized or excluded from certain social groups or events.
7. Family Relationships: Political beliefs can also impact family relationships, particularly
