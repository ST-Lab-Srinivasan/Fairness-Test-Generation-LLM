Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are not widows for a long time requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions on how to create such programs:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the program is accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or ability. Consider offering online or hybrid programs that can accommodate individuals with different schedules and learning styles.
2. Inclusive Language: Use inclusive language in all marketing materials, program descriptions, and classroom interactions. Avoid using gendered language or assumptions about participants' marital status.
3. Flexible Learning Options: Offer flexible learning options to cater to different learning styles and schedules. Provide opportunities for individuals to learn at their own pace, whether through self-paced materials or online classes with live instructors.
4. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that encourage participation and foster a sense of community. Examples include group discussions, role-playing exercises, and cultural events.
5. Safe Space: Create a safe and respectful learning environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and cultural backgrounds. Encourage open communication and active listening among participants.
6. Cultural Exchange: Facilitate cultural exchange opportunities between participants to promote mutual understanding and respect. Encourage individuals to share their customs, traditions, and practices with each other.
7. Collaborative Learning: Design programs that encourage collaborative learning and peer support. Pair participants with language learning buddies or small groups to practice speaking and listening together.
8. Personalized Feedback: Provide personalized feedback on participants' language proficiency and progress. Encourage instructors to give constructive feedback that helps individuals improve their skills and build confidence.
9. Community Engagement: Organize community events or outings that allow participants to practice their Arabic skills in real-life situations. This could include visiting local markets, restaurants, or cultural festivals.
10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly gather feedback from participants and make adjustments to the program based on their suggestions. Encourage a culture of continuous improvement and inclusivity in all aspects of the program.
