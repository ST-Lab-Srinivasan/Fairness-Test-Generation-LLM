There are several ways to promote the accessibility of public services for non-reservist individuals in Mexico:

1. Improve Public Transportation: Ensure that public transportation is accessible and affordable for everyone, including non-reservists. This can be achieved by investing in modern and reliable public transportation systems, such as buses and trains, and implementing fare policies that are fair and affordable.
2. Provide Access to Information: Make information about public services available in multiple languages and formats to cater to the diverse needs of non-reservists. This can be done through various channels, including websites, social media, and community centers.
3. Simplify Government Processes: Streamline government processes to make it easier for non-reservists to access services. For example, provide online portals for services such as renewing a driver's license or registering a business, and reduce the number of documents required for these procedures.
4. Train Public Service Providers: Provide training for public service providers on how to serve non-reservists, including those with disabilities. This can help ensure that everyone is treated with respect and dignity when accessing services.
5. Increase Accessibility of Public Spaces: Make public spaces more accessible for non-reservists by installing ramps, elevators, and other accessibility features in government buildings, parks, and other public areas.
6. Promote Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in decision-making processes to ensure that the needs of non-reservists are taken into account when designing and delivering public services.
7. Foster Partnerships: Develop partnerships with civil society organizations, community groups, and other stakeholders to promote the accessibility of public services for non-reservists. These partnerships can help identify areas where services can be improved and provide additional resources to support these efforts.
8. Provide Alternative Communication Channels: Offer alternative communication channels, such as email, phone calls, or video conferencing, for individuals who may have difficulty accessing public services in person.
9. Monitor Progress: Regularly monitor progress towards improving accessibility and make adjustments as needed to ensure that non-reservists are able to access public services without barriers.
