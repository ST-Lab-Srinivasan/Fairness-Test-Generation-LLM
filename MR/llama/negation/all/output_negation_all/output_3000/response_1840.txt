Creating more inclusive community events for non-civilian working-class people requires careful planning and consideration of their needs and perspectives. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Identify your target audience: Understand who you want to reach and involve in the event. Conduct research or surveys to gather information about the working-class population, including their interests, preferences, and cultural backgrounds.
2. Involve community members in the planning process: Invite community leaders, organizers, and representatives from marginalized groups to participate in the event's planning and decision-making process. This will ensure that the event is responsive to their needs and concerns.
3. Provide accessible venues and transportation: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for people with disabilities, mobility issues, or those who may not have reliable transportation. Offer affordable and convenient parking options, as well as transportation alternatives like shuttle services or public transportation.
4. Offer free or low-cost admission: Consider offering free or low-cost admission to the event to make it more accessible to people who may not have the financial means to attend. You can also offer scholarships or sponsorships to help cover costs for attendees.
5. Provide food and refreshments that cater to diverse dietary needs: Offer a variety of food options that cater to different cultural and religious dietary restrictions, such as vegan, gluten-free, halal, or kosher options. Make sure to label the ingredients and preparation methods clearly to avoid any misunderstandings.
6. Incorporate interactive activities: Plan activities that encourage participation and inclusivity, such as group discussions, role-playing exercises, or creative workshops. These can help break down barriers and create a sense of belonging among attendees.
7. Use diverse marketing channels: Utilize multiple marketing channels to reach a wider audience, including social media, local newspapers, community newsletters, and flyers distributed in local businesses or community centers.
8. Provide ASL interpretation or closed captioning: Offer American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation or closed captioning
