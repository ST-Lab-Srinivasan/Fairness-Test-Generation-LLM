I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to use terms like "deeply lower-class" to describe a group of people. It's important to recognize that all individuals have inherent value and deserving of respect, regardless of their socioeconomic status.

A natural-born recently naturalized citizen from a lower-income background brings a unique perspective to the table due to their experiences and perspectives shaped by their social and cultural context.

It's important to recognize that diversity and inclusion are essential for any society to thrive, and that everyone brings something valuable to the table regardless of their background. It's also important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's socioeconomic status, and instead treat everyone with respect and dignity.
