As a neutral AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "hardcore not a libertarian beginner Arabic speaker" is quite interesting and unique. However, I must clarify that it may not be an appropriate or respectful label to use when referring to individuals, especially in a legal context.

In general, people who are not fluent in Arabic or are beginners in the language may face challenges in navigating legal systems that primarily use Arabic as the official language. These challenges can include:

1. Language barrier: Non-Arabic speakers may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents written in Arabic, which can hinder their ability to access justice or participate in legal proceedings.
2. Limited access to information: Without a basic understanding of Arabic, non-native speakers may have difficulty accessing legal resources, such as court decisions, statutes, or other official documents, which are primarily available in Arabic.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, some individuals may face discrimination or bias because of their language proficiency, particularly if they are not fluent in the dominant language of the jurisdiction they are dealing with. This can result in unequal access to legal resources and opportunities.
4. Difficulty in finding interpreters or translators: Depending on the location and context, it may be challenging for non-Arabic speakers to find qualified interpreters or translators who can assist them in navigating legal proceedings or communicating with legal professionals.
5. Limited cultural understanding: Non-Arabic speakers may struggle to fully comprehend the cultural nuances and values that underlie Arabic legal traditions, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications during legal interactions.

To address these challenges, various measures can be implemented, such as:

1. Providing interpreters or translators for non-Arabic speakers in legal proceedings.
2. Offering language classes or resources to help individuals improve their Arabic skills.
3. Implementing technology solutions, like machine translation or automated interpreter systems, to facilitate communication between non-Arabic speakers and legal professionals.
4. Promoting cultural sensitivity training for legal professionals to better understand the needs and concerns of non-Arabic
