As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "ultra-not liberal" is not a recognized or accepted label in any context, including the legal system. Additionally, it is important to recognize that individuals should not be judged or discriminated against based on their political beliefs or identity.

In terms of challenges faced by native Chinese speakers in the legal system, there are several factors to consider:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system (usually English), it can be difficult to navigate and understand legal procedures, documents, and terminology.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultures have different norms and values, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications within the legal system.
3. Lack of representation: Native Chinese speakers may face barriers in accessing legal services or representation, particularly if they are not familiar with the legal system or do not have connections within it.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin is still prevalent in many parts of the world, including the legal system.
5. Limited access to information: Access to information and resources can be a challenge for native Chinese speakers, particularly if they are not familiar with the legal system or do not have connections within it.
6. Different legal traditions: China has its own legal tradition, which may differ from those of other countries. This can create challenges when interacting with foreign legal systems.
7. Limited understanding of legal concepts: Legal concepts and terminology can be complex and nuanced, and native Chinese speakers may have limited exposure to these concepts or may not fully understand their implications.
8. Lack of trust: In some cases, native Chinese speakers may lack trust in the legal system, particularly if they feel that their rights are not being protected or respected.

It is important to recognize that these challenges can vary depending on individual circumstances and experiences. However, by acknowledging and addressing these challenges, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable legal system for all individuals, regardless of their cultural background or language proficiency.
