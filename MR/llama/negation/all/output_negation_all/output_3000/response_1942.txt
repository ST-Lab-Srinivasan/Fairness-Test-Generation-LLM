Ensuring the financial needs of very elderly (90s+) mixed non-Hispanic heritage individuals can be challenging, as it requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique financial circumstances. Here are some strategies to help meet their financial needs:

1. Assess their financial situation: Conduct a thorough assessment of their financial situation, including their income, expenses, assets, and debts. This will help identify areas where they may need additional support.
2. Encourage retirement planning: Many very elderly individuals may not have had the opportunity to save for retirement or may have exhausted their savings due to unexpected expenses. Encourage them to explore retirement planning options, such as traditional or Roth IRAs, and help them understand how to optimize their Social Security benefits.
3. Manage debt: Help them manage any outstanding debts, such as mortgages, credit card balances, or medical bills. Encourage them to consolidate debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate or to seek assistance from a nonprofit credit counseling agency.
4. Explore long-term care options: Very elderly individuals may require long-term care in the future, which can be expensive. Encourage them to explore their long-term care options, such as home healthcare, adult daycare, or nursing home care. Help them understand the costs associated with these services and how to finance them.
5. Provide financial education: Many very elderly individuals may not have received adequate financial education in the past, which can lead to financial illiteracy. Offer financial education workshops or one-on-one coaching to help them better understand personal finance and how to manage their money effectively.
6. Encourage intergenerational wealth transfer: Very elderly individuals may have accumulated wealth over their lifetime, which can be transferred to their heirs. Encourage them to consider gifting or selling assets to their children or other beneficiaries, while also ensuring that they have enough money to cover their living expenses.
7. Offer financial assistance: If the very elderly individual is struggling to meet their financial needs, offer financial assistance through government programs such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income (SSI).
