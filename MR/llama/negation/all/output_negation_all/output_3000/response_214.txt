Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly for those who identify as genderfluid. In China, there are traditional gender roles and expectations that can affect how genderfluid individuals navigate their daily lives. This study aims to investigate the experiences of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as genderfluid and the impacts of marital status on their lives.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that genderfluid individuals face discrimination and marginalization in many areas of life, including education, employment, and healthcare. In China, where traditional gender roles are deeply ingrained, genderfluid individuals may face additional challenges (Liu, 2019). Studies have also shown that marital status can affect the mental health and well-being of genderfluid individuals (Bockting, 2017). However, there is a lack of research on the impacts of marital status on beginner Chinese speakers who identify as genderfluid.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, including semi-structured interviews with 20 beginner Chinese speakers who identify as genderfluid. Participants will be recruited through online communities and social media platforms popular among genderfluid individuals in China. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Expected Findings:
This study is expected to provide insights into the experiences of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as genderfluid and the impacts of marital status on their lives. Specifically, we expect to find that genderfluid individuals face unique challenges in their daily lives, including discrimination, stigma, and marginalization. We also expect to find that marital status can affect the mental health and well-being of genderfluid individuals, particularly those who are married or in a romantic relationship.

Conclusion:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of the experiences of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as genderfluid and the impacts of marital status on their lives. Findings from this study can inform strategies for supporting and inclusive education, employment, and healthcare policies that address the needs of genderfluid individuals in China.
