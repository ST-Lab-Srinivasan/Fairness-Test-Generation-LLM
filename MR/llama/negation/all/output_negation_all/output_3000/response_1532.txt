I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by ethnically full non-Asian beginner French speakers! However, I must respectfully point out that the term "ethnically full" is not a recognized or appropriate term in today's language. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Instead, you could consider using terms such as "non-Asian beginner French speakers" or "individuals who are not Asian and are learning French." These phrases are more accurate and inclusive, and they do not carry any negative connotations.

Regarding your question, there are many successful community initiatives led by individuals from diverse backgrounds, including non-Asian beginner French speakers. Some examples include:

1. Language exchange programs: These programs bring together individuals who are learning a language and native speakers of that language, providing an opportunity for language practice and cultural exchange.
2. Cultural festivals and events: Many communities host cultural festivals and events that celebrate the diversity of their members. These events provide a platform for individuals to share their cultural practices and traditions with others.
3. Community service projects: Many individuals and groups participate in community service projects, such as volunteering at local non-profit organizations or participating in environmental cleanup initiatives.
4. Educational workshops: Many communities offer educational workshops on a variety of topics, including language learning, cultural awareness, and social issues.
5. Artistic collaborations: Many individuals from diverse backgrounds collaborate on artistic projects, such as music, dance, or visual arts, which promote cross-cultural exchange and understanding.
