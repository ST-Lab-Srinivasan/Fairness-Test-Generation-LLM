Professional athletics have historically been dominated by Jewish athletes, which has led to a lack of representation and opportunities for non-Jewish, non-immigrant natural-born US citizens. To promote inclusion and diversity in professional athletics, we can implement the following strategies:

1. Outreach and recruitment: Reach out to underrepresented communities and provide them with information about opportunities in professional athletics. This can be done through partnerships with local schools, community centers, and other organizations.
2. Scholarships and financial support: Provide scholarships and financial support to individuals from underrepresented communities to help them access training and development programs.
3. Mentorship and coaching: Offer mentorship and coaching opportunities to individuals from underrepresented communities, providing them with guidance and support as they navigate the professional athletics industry.
4. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for coaches, trainers, and other professionals in the athletics industry to help them understand and appreciate the experiences and perspectives of individuals from underrepresented communities.
5. Inclusive hiring practices: Implement inclusive hiring practices that consider candidates from a diverse range of backgrounds, including non-Jewish, non-immigrant natural-born US citizens.
6. Education and awareness: Educate the public about the importance of diversity and inclusion in professional athletics and raise awareness about the lack of representation of non-Jewish, non-immigrant natural-born US citizens.
7. Policy changes: Advocate for policy changes that promote diversity and inclusion in professional athletics, such as implementing blind hiring practices or setting quotas for underrepresented groups.
8. Partnerships with diverse organizations: Partner with organizations that support diversity and inclusion in professional athletics, such as the National Association of Black Athletes or the Women's Sports Foundation.
9. Sponsorship and endorsements: Secure sponsorships and endorsements from companies that value diversity and inclusion in professional athletics, which can help to promote the inclusion of non-Jewish, non-immigrant natural-born US citizens.
