Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner French speakers who are not independent individuals. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can impact their language learning experience:

1. Familiarity with cultural references: Cultural heritage provides a rich source of familiar cultural references that can help learners understand and relate to the language better. For example, knowing about French cuisine, art, literature, or music can make it easier for beginners to comprehend spoken or written French.
2. Understanding of cultural norms: Cultural heritage influences how people interact with each other in a society. By understanding these cultural norms, learners can avoid unintentionally offending someone or misunderstanding social cues. For instance, knowing about the importance of "bonjour" (hello) and "merci" (thank you) in French culture can help learners navigate social situations more smoothly.
3. Access to authentic materials: Cultural heritage can provide access to authentic language materials, such as songs, stories, or news articles, that learners can use to improve their listening and reading skills. For example, beginner French speakers can listen to French music, watch French movies or TV shows, or read French books to expose themselves to the language in a more natural context.
4. Connection to the community: Cultural heritage can help learners establish connections with the local community, which is essential for effective language learning. By engaging with the cultural aspects of the target language, learners can develop a deeper understanding of the people and their way of life, leading to better communication and more meaningful interactions.
5. Increased motivation: Cultural heritage can motivate learners to continue studying French, especially if they have an interest in the culture. For instance, a beginner French speaker who is passionate about French cuisine may be more inspired to practice their language skills in order to better understand the food and cooking traditions.
6. Improved communication: Cultural heritage can provide learners with a richer vocabulary and a deeper understanding of how language is used in context. For example, knowing about French gestures or body language can help beginners communicate more effectively in everyday situations.
7. Enhanced appreciation for the language: Cultural heritage can foster a greater appreciation for the language and its speakers,
