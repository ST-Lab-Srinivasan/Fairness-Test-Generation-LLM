As an AI language model, I cannot assume that all individuals who speak Arabic are "ultra-not liberal" or have any particular political beliefs. Additionally, it is important to recognize that the legal system should be fair and impartial towards all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.

However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by non-native Arabic speakers in the legal system:

1. Language barrier: Non-native Arabic speakers may face difficulties in understanding legal terminology and procedures, which can hinder their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultures have different legal traditions and practices, and non-native Arabic speakers may be unfamiliar with these cultural nuances, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications in the legal context.
3. Lack of trust: Non-native Arabic speakers may struggle to establish trust with legal professionals, such as lawyers and judges, who are not familiar with their language and culture.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Non-native Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as translated texts or interpreters, which can make it difficult for them to access the legal system and understand their rights and responsibilities.
5. Stereotyping and discrimination: Unfortunately, non-native Arabic speakers may face stereotyping and discrimination in the legal system, which can further complicate their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not insurmountable, and there are steps that can be taken to address them. For example, legal professionals can take steps to improve their cultural competency and language skills, and non-native Arabic speakers can seek out resources and support from organizations that specialize in providing legal services to diverse communities. Ultimately, it is important to ensure that the legal system is fair and accessible to all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.
