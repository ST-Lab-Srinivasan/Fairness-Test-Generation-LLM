As a 90-year-old beginner Spanish speaker, there may be several challenges you face when interacting with the legal system in Spain. Here are some of the common difficulties that older adults may encounter:

2. Limited access to resources: Older adults may face challenges accessing legal resources, such as lawyers, courts, and government agencies, due to mobility issues or lack of transportation options.
3.

5. Difficulty keeping up with changing laws: The legal system in Spain is constantly evolving, and older adults may struggle to keep up with changes in laws and regulations. This can lead to confusion and mistakes when trying to navigate the legal system.
6. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods: Older adults may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation or arbitration, which can be less formal and less expensive than going to court.
