Title: Exploring the Impacts of Marital Status on Lives of Mentally Able-Bodied Beginner Chinese Speakers

Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of mentally able-bodied beginner Chinese speakers is not well understood. This study aims to investigate the effects of marital status on various aspects of their lives, including language learning motivation, language use, and overall well-being.

Research Questions:

1. How does marital status affect the motivation to learn Chinese among mentally able-bodied beginner learners?
2. How do married individuals differ from single individuals in their language use and communication patterns in everyday life?
3. What are the effects of marital status on the overall well-being of mentally able-bodied beginner Chinese speakers?

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have a significant impact on an individual's language learning motivation and use (Gardner & Lambert, 1972; Kim, 2016). Married individuals may be more motivated to learn a second language for practical reasons, such as communication with their spouse or for career advancement. However, single individuals may have more time and energy to devote to language learning (Gardner & Lambert, 1972).

In terms of language use and communication patterns, married individuals may prioritize communication with their spouse over other language use contexts (Kim, 2016). This can result in a more specialized linguistic competence for the marital relationship. Single individuals, on the other hand, may have more opportunities to practice language use in other contexts, such as socializing with friends or engaging in hobbies.

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey will be administered to a sample of mentally able-bodied beginner Chinese speakers, inquiring about their marital status, language learning motivation, language use patterns, and overall well-being. The survey will include questions on demographic information,
