Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-immigrant, non-libertarian individuals in the United States. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For example, someone whose family has been in the United States for generations may feel a strong connection to American culture, even if they were not born here.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals form their identities. For instance, someone who grows up speaking Spanish at home may identify as Latinx, while someone who grows up speaking English may identify as American.
3. Cultural practices and traditions: Cultural heritage shapes the way individuals practice their faith, celebrate holidays, and observe cultural rituals. For example, someone whose family observes a particular festival or tradition may feel a strong connection to that culture.
4. Language: Language is an important aspect of cultural heritage, as it can influence how individuals communicate with others and express themselves culturally. For instance, someone who speaks Spanish at home may identify more closely with Latinx culture than someone who speaks English.

6. Music and art: Music and art are important aspects of cultural heritage, as they can evoke feelings of nostalgia and belonging. For instance, someone who listens to music from their country of origin may identify more closely with that culture than someone who listens to music from another country.
7. History: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals understand their place in history. For example, someone whose family has been in the United States for generations may feel a strong connection to American history and culture.
8. Community: Cultural heritage can shape the way individuals interact with their communities. For instance, someone who grows up in a community with a shared cultural identity may feel a stronger sense of belonging than someone who grows up in a diverse community.
