Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Beginner French Speakers After Loss of a Spouse

Introduction:
Losing a spouse can be a life-altering experience, and it often leads to a reevaluation of one's identity. For beginner French speakers who have recently lost their spouse, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping their identities. This paper will explore the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how they navigate their grief.

Theories:
This study will draw upon several theories to understand the relationship between cultural heritage and identity formation. The first is the concept of "cultural identity," which refers to the beliefs, values, customs, and traditions that define a group or individual (Hall, 1989). Secondly, the theory of "grief" will be considered, which refers to the emotional response to loss, including sadness, anger, guilt, and nostalgia (Kubler-Ross, 1969). Finally, the concept of "identity formation" will be explored, which involves the ongoing process of creating and negotiating one's sense of self in relation to others and the environment (Hart, 1998).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, with semi-structured interviews conducted with beginner French speakers who have lost their spouses. Participants will be recruited through community groups and online forums, and will be selected based on their proficiency in French language and their recent loss of a spouse. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and codes related to cultural heritage and identity formation.

Results:
The results of this study will indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of beginner French speakers after loss of a spouse. Participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural traditions and customs, which provided comfort and meaning during the grieving process. For example, one participant shared how their cultural heritage helped them to find solace in traditional foods and rituals:
