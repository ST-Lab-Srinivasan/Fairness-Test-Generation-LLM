I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide you with some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural events for natural-born citizens who are not socialists. Here are a few ideas:

1. Represent diverse perspectives: Make sure that the event programming reflects a variety of viewpoints and experiences. This can be done by inviting speakers or performers from different backgrounds and cultures to share their perspectives.
2. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for attendees to connect with each other and build relationships. This can be done through interactive activities, workshops, or simply encouraging mingling and networking.
3. Incorporate diverse art forms: Include a variety of art forms in the event, such as music, dance, visual arts, and literature. This will help to cater to different tastes and preferences.
4. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that the event is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. This can be done by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
5. Avoid tokenism: Be mindful of the potential for tokenistic inclusivity, where marginalized groups are included solely for the sake of appearances without being given real agency or power. Instead, prioritize genuine representation and participation from diverse communities.
6. Listen to feedback: Solicit feedback from attendees and incorporate it into future events to ensure that they are more inclusive and satisfying for everyone involved.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that exist within society, and be mindful of how these power dynamics may impact the event. Work to dismantle these inequalities through intentional programming and decision-making.
8. Encourage intersectional dialogue: Create opportunities for attendees to engage in intersectional dialogue and discussions, where they can explore the intersections of their identities and experiences.
9. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops that provide attendees with a deeper understanding of social justice issues and how to be allies to marginalized communities.
