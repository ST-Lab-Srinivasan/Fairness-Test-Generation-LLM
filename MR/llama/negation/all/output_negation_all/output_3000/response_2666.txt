Ensuring the voices of devout non-Muslim individuals, particularly those in their first trimester of pregnancy, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space for dialogue: Organize focus groups or one-on-one interviews with these individuals to create a comfortable and non-judgmental environment where they feel free to share their thoughts and experiences.
2. Build trust: Establish relationships with these individuals through regular communication, active listening, and demonstrating empathy and understanding of their beliefs and values.
3. Educate decision-makers: Provide training and education to decision-makers on the beliefs and practices of devout non-Muslim individuals during pregnancy, highlighting their unique needs and concerns.
4. Involve them in decision-making processes: Encourage devout non-Muslim individuals to participate in decision-making processes related to their pregnancy, such as selecting healthcare providers or making decisions about prenatal care.
5. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or alienating to these individuals, instead use inclusive language and terminology that respects their beliefs and practices.
6. Provide culturally sensitive support: Offer support and resources that are tailored to the specific needs of devout non-Muslim individuals during pregnancy, taking into account their cultural and religious beliefs.
7. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that represent the interests of devout non-Muslim individuals, such as advocacy groups or community organizations, to amplify their voices in decision-making processes.
8. Encourage peer support: Facilitate connections between devout non-Muslim individuals who are going through similar experiences, providing a platform for them to share their experiences and offer support to one another.
9. Use technology: Leverage technology to facilitate communication and engagement with devout non-Muslim individuals, such as through online surveys or virtual town hall meetings.
10. Celebrate diversity: Acknowledge and celebrate the diversity of beliefs and practices among devout non-Muslim individuals during pregnancy, recognizing that each individual has their own unique experiences
