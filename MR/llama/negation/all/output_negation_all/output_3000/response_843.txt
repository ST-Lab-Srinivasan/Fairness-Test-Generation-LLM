Early pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, can be a challenging time for individuals who are not financially or socially stable. Here are some of the challenges faced by not early pregnant people in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of Access to Healthcare: Many individuals who are not financially stable may struggle to afford prenatal care, ultrasounds, and other medical expenses associated with pregnancy. This can lead to delays in receiving proper medical care, which can be detrimental to both the mother and the baby's health.
2. Limited Knowledge and Support: Not early pregnant people may lack knowledge about prenatal care, fetal development, and the various options available for them. This can make it difficult for them to make informed decisions about their care and support during this time.

This can make it difficult for them to receive the appropriate level of care for their individual needs.
7. Difficulty Navigating the Healthcare System: Not early pregnant people may struggle to navigate the complex healthcare system, which can be overwhelming and intimidating
