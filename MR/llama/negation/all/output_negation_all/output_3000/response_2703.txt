As a leftist, you may face several challenges in the job market as an average income earner. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Wage stagnation: The wages of average income earners have been stagnant for decades, failing to keep pace with inflation. This means that the purchasing power of your income is decreasing over time, making it harder to afford basic necessities like housing, food, and healthcare.
2. Job insecurity: The rise of automation and artificial intelligence has led to job insecurity for many workers, including those in middle-income jobs. You may find yourself replaced by machines or faced with the prospect of constant layoffs and hiring freezes.
3. Lack of benefits: Many average income earners are denied basic benefits like healthcare, retirement plans, and paid time off. This can leave you vulnerable to financial shocks and make it harder to plan for your future.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other factors is still prevalent in the job market. As a leftist, you may face discrimination or be overlooked for promotions and opportunities due to your political beliefs.
5. Burnout: The constant stress of living in a capitalist society can lead to burnout and mental health issues. As an average income earner, you may feel like you're constantly struggling to make ends meet and keep up with the demands of work and personal life.
6. Lack of representation: As a leftist, you may feel underrepresented in the workplace or in positions of power. This can lead to a lack of voices advocating for your interests and needs in the workplace.
7. Limited career advancement opportunities: Many average income earners face limited opportunities for career advancement due to a lack of resources, connections, or access to education and training. This can make it harder to move up the career ladder and achieve financial stability.
8. Gendered and racist expectations: Women and people of color may face gendered and racist expectations in the workplace, such as being expected to perform more emotional labor or take on more caregiving responsibilities. These expectations can limit your opportunities for advancement and recognition
