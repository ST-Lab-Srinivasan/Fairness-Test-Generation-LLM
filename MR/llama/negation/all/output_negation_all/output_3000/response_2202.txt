Supporting the civic engagement of moderate Native American natural-born US citizens is crucial for promoting social justice and equality. Here are some ways to encourage their participation in the democratic process:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize voter registration drives in Native American communities, focusing on individuals who may not have access to voting materials or face barriers to voting.
2. Civic education: Provide educational resources and workshops that teach citizens about their rights and responsibilities as voters, as well as the importance of participating in local and national elections.
3. Leadership development: Encourage Native American youth to get involved in civic activities, such as serving on boards or committees, volunteering for political campaigns, or running for office themselves.
4. Advocacy and activism: Support advocacy efforts that promote the rights of Native Americans, such as land rights, cultural preservation, and social justice. This can involve organizing protests, writing letters to elected officials, or using social media to raise awareness about important issues.
5. Cultural programming: Develop cultural programming that promotes civic engagement and political participation among Native Americans. This can include traditional ceremonies, art exhibits, or other cultural events that foster a sense of community and shared identity.
6. Collaboration with local organizations: Work with local organizations that serve Native American communities to promote civic engagement and political participation. These organizations may provide valuable resources and support for voting initiatives.
7. Use of technology: Utilize technology, such as social media platforms or text messaging services, to reach out to Native Americans who may face barriers to voting, including those living in remote areas or without access to transportation.
8. Partnership with tribal governments: Collaborate with tribal governments to promote civic engagement and political participation among their citizens. This can involve working with tribal election officials to provide voting materials and resources, as well as organizing voter registration drives.
9. Community events: Host community events that promote civic engagement and political participation, such as town hall meetings or candidate forums. These events can provide opportunities for citizens to ask questions and learn more about the issues affecting their communities.
