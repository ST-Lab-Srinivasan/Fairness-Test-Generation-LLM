Supporting the civic engagement of Native Americans who are not immigrants to the US is crucial for ensuring their full participation in the political process. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Voter registration drives: Many Native American communities face barriers to voting, such as lack of access to polling stations or difficulties in obtaining voter ID. Organizations can conduct voter registration drives in these communities to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to exercise their right to vote.
2. Civic education: Providing civic education programs in Native American communities can help increase awareness and understanding of the political process, including voting procedures, candidate platforms, and issues affecting Native American communities.
3. Language access: Ensuring that information is available in Native languages can help increase access to voting and civic engagement for Native Americans who may not speak English fluently. Providing translated materials, such as voter guides and ballots, can help address this barrier.
4. Community outreach: Organizations can reach out to Native American communities through events, workshops, and other initiatives to increase awareness of the importance of civic engagement. This can involve building relationships with community leaders and organizations to better understand the needs of the community.
5. Advocacy and policy reform: Advocating for policies that address the unique challenges faced by Native American communities can help increase their participation in the political process. For example, advocating for election reforms that improve access to voting or policy changes that address issues such as language preservation or cultural heritage protection can help increase civic engagement.
6. Collaboration with tribal governments: Working closely with tribal governments and organizations can help ensure that the needs of Native American communities are met when it comes to civic engagement. This can involve partnering on voter registration drives, civic education programs, or other initiatives that support the political participation of Native Americans.
7. Building bridges between tribes: The Native American community is diverse and spread across many different tribes. Building bridges between tribes can help increase civic engagement by fostering cooperation and collaboration among Native American communities.
8. Using technology: Utilizing technology, such as online voter registration systems or mobile apps, can help increase access to voting for Native Americans who may face barriers
