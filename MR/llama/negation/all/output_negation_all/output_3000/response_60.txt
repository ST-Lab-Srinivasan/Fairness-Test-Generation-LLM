Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-temporary visa holders and non-asexual individuals requires intentional effort and consideration. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities, sexual orientations, and abilities. Avoid using language that assumes a binary understanding of gender or sexuality.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible and has accessible restrooms. Provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities, such as sign language interpreters or audio describers.
3. Diverse Programming: Offer programming that reflects the diversity of your community, including art forms, music, and performances that represent a range of cultures and identities.
4. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals who may feel marginalized or uncomfortable in mainstream cultural events. This can include designated gender-neutral spaces or creating a code of conduct that promotes respect and inclusivity.
5. Involve Marginalized Communities: Actively involve marginalized communities in the planning and execution of cultural events. This can include partnering with organizations that support these communities or incorporating their perspectives and experiences into the event design.
6. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness-raising opportunities during cultural events to help attendees understand the experiences and challenges faced by marginalized communities. This can include workshops, panels, or exhibitions that highlight these issues.
7. Inclusive Marketing: Use marketing materials that are inclusive and representative of the diversity of your community. Avoid using language or images that stereotype or marginalize any group.
8. Flexible Ticketing Options: Offer flexible ticketing options, such as pay-what-you-can or sliding scale pricing, to ensure that everyone can attend cultural events regardless of their financial means.
9. Collaborations and Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support marginalized communities to co-host cultural events or share resources. This can help amplify the voices and experiences of these communities and create more inclusive events.
10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly assess and improve
