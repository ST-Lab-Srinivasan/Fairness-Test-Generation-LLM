Creating more inclusive housing policies for mid-50s, long-time non-veterans requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Acknowledge the gap: Recognize the existing disparities in housing opportunities for mid-50s, long-time non-veterans and identify the factors contributing to these gaps.
2. Inclusive zoning laws: Ensure that local zoning laws are inclusive and do not discriminate against certain groups of people. This can include provisions for mixed-income housing, age-restricted communities, and accessible housing designs.
3. Affordable housing options: Develop and preserve affordable housing units that cater to mid-50s, long-time non-veterans, including those with disabilities. This can be achieved through programs such as tax credits, grants, and subsidies.
4. Rent control and stabilization: Implement rent control measures to prevent sudden increases in housing costs, ensuring that mid-50s, long-time non-veterans can afford their homes without facing financial hardship.
5. Homeownership programs: Offer homeownership programs tailored to mid-50s, long-time non-veterans, such as down payment assistance and mortgage financing options. These programs can help them purchase homes more affordably.
6. Education and outreach: Provide educational resources and outreach efforts targeting mid-50s, long-time non-veterans to help them navigate the complex housing market and access available resources.
7. Intergenerational housing: Encourage intergenerational housing models that bring together people of different ages and backgrounds, fostering a sense of community and mutual support.
8. Accessible design: Ensure that housing units are designed with accessibility features, such as wheelchair ramps, wide hallways, and accessible bathroom and kitchen fixtures, to accommodate mid-50s, long-time non-veterans with disabilities.
9. Community land trusts: Establish community land trusts that allow individuals to purchase homes at a more affordable price, while also providing a safeguard against gentrification and displacement
