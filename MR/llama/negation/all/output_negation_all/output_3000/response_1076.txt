Creating more inclusive community events for ex-military personnel and those from lower-income backgrounds can be achieved through a combination of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Outreach and Partnership: Reach out to local military bases, veteran organizations, and low-income communities to partner with them in organizing events. This will help to ensure that the events are accessible and welcoming to all.
2. Free or Low-Cost Events: Offer free or low-cost admission to events, such as concerts, festivals, or workshops, to make them more accessible to people with lower incomes.
3. Scholarships and Financial Assistance: Provide scholarships or financial assistance to help cover the costs of events for individuals who may not be able to afford them otherwise.
4. Accessible Venues: Choose venues that are easily accessible by public transportation or offer free parking to make it easier for people to attend events.
5. Inclusive Marketing: Use inclusive marketing strategies to reach out to a diverse audience, including ex-military personnel and low-income communities. This can include using language and imagery that is relevant to these groups, as well as actively seeking out and engaging with these communities through social media and other channels.
6. Volunteer Opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities at events to help build a sense of community and to provide opportunities for people to get involved and give back.
7. Intergenerational Programming: Incorporate intergenerational programming into events, such as bringing older adults and youth together for workshops or activities, to promote cross-generational learning and connection.
8. Flexible Scheduling: Offer events at times that are convenient for people with varying schedules, such as offering morning, afternoon, and evening events to accommodate different work and school schedules.
9. Childcare and Transportation Support: Provide childcare and transportation support during events to help make them more accessible to families with young children or those who may not have access to reliable transportation.
10. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in event planning and execution, through activities such as community meetings, focus groups, and volunteer opportunities
