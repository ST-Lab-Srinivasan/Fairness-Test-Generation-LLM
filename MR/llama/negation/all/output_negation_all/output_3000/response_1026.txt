The role of language in the identity of very old (90s+) non-reservists can be complex and multifaceted. Here are some possible ways in which language may play a role in their identity:

1. Connection to the past: For many older adults, language is a crucial connection to their past and cultural heritage. They may have grown up speaking a particular language or dialect, which is closely tied to their family, community, and cultural traditions. As they age, this language may become an important part of their identity and sense of self.
2. Sense of belonging: Language can also play a role in creating a sense of belonging for older adults. For example, if an older adult speaks a particular language that is prevalent in their community or region, they may feel more connected to that place and its culture. On the other hand, if they speak a language that is less common in their area, they may feel like outsiders or minorities.
3. Identity formation: Language can also be involved in the formation of identity, particularly for older adults who are trying to make sense of their lives and experiences. For example, an older adult may use language to express their values, beliefs, and worldview, which can shape their identity and sense of self.
4. Intergenerational relationships: Language can also play a role in intergenerational relationships between older adults and younger generations. For example, an older adult may use language to connect with their grandchildren or great-grandchildren, sharing stories, traditions, and cultural practices that are important to them.
5. Social interaction: Finally, language can play a role in social interaction for older adults, particularly those who are isolated or living alone. For example, an older adult may use language to connect with others in their community or to participate in activities that they enjoy, such as book clubs or volunteer work.

In summary, language plays a complex and multifaceted role in the identity of very old (90s+) non-reservists. It can connect them to their past, create a sense of belonging, inform identity formation, facilitate intergenerational relationships, and provide opportunities for social interaction.
