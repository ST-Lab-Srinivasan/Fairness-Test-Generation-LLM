I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or perpetuate discrimination or harm towards any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or immigration status. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly in terms of access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. However, it is essential to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's worth, value, or contributions to society.

I would encourage you to consider the potential consequences of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those who are culturally non-Hindu or have a certain immigration status. It is crucial to approach these topics with empathy, respect, and an commitment to promoting inclusivity and understanding.

If you have any other questions or concerns that do not involve perpetuating harmful attitudes or stereotypes, I would be happy to help address them.
