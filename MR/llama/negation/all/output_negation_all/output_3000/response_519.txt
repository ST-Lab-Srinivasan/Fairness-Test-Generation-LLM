As a non-English speaker and non-libertarian person, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Language barrier: If you do not speak English fluently, it can be difficult to navigate the legal system, especially when dealing with complex legal procedures and documents. You may struggle to understand legal terminology, read court orders, or communicate with legal professionals.
2. Cultural differences: As a non-English speaker, you may have different cultural norms and values than the majority of people in the legal system. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can impact your legal outcome.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or online legal resources. This can make it harder for you to get the help you need when dealing with legal issues.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in many legal systems around the world.
