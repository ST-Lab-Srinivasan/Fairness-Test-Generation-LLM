Supporting the community engagement of actively fully embracing non-binary identifying active-duty individuals requires a deliberate and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Training: Provide training for military leaders and personnel on the importance of inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all gender identities. This can include information on non-binary identity, its significance, and how to create an inclusive environment.
2. Policy Reforms: Review and update policies to ensure they are inclusive of non-binary individuals. This may involve revising uniform standards, grooming policies, and other guidelines to be gender-neutral.
3. Language and Communication: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (e.g., "soldiers" or "service members") and instead use language that includes non-binary individuals (e.g., "service members" or "team members").

6. Visibility and Role Models: Showcase non-binary individuals in leadership positions or other high-profile roles to inspire and support others who may identify as non-binary. Provide role models and mentors for non-binary individuals to look up to and feel seen and supported.
