It is important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of natural-born non-Canadian citizen mixed non-Asian heritage people. These individuals may identify with multiple cultures and may feel a sense of belonging to both their immigrant culture and their adopted country. Here are some ways that cultural heritage can impact the lives of these individuals:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity, especially for those who identify as mixed or multiracial. It can influence how they see themselves in relation to their parents, grandparents, and other family members, as well as their adopted country.
2. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a particular community or group. For example, a person who identifies as mixed non-Asian heritage may feel a strong connection to their immigrant culture and community, even if they were born and raised in Canada.
3. Cultural practices and traditions: Cultural heritage can influence the cultural practices and traditions that an individual grows up with. For example, a person who identifies as mixed non-Asian heritage may celebrate both their immigrant culture's holidays and Canadian holidays, or they may adopt practices from both cultures.
4. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, and class. For example, a person who identifies as mixed non-Asian heritage may experience discrimination or prejudice based on their race or ethnicity, while also facing challenges related to their immigrant status.
5. Community building: Cultural heritage can play a role in building and maintaining community connections. For example, a person who identifies as mixed non-Asian heritage may feel a strong connection to their immigrant community and participate in cultural events or activities that celebrate their heritage.
6. Education: Cultural heritage can impact how individuals learn about and engage with their heritage. For example, a person who identities as mixed non-Asian heritage may have access to education programs that teach them about their immigrant culture and history.
7. Employment and economic opportunities: Cultural heritage can impact an individual's access to employment and economic opportunities.
