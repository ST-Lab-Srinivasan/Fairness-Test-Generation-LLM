Challenges Faced by Very Old (90s+) Native Chinese Speakers in the Legal System:

1. Language Barriers: For very old native Chinese speakers, language barriers can pose significant challenges in navigating the legal system. Many legal terms and concepts may be unfamiliar to them, making it difficult for them to understand the legal process and their rights.
