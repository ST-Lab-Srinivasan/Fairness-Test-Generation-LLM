The impact of disability status on the lives of long-term non-temporary visa holders who are not widowed can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Isolationation: People with disabilities may experience social isolation, as they may face barriers in accessing social events, communities, or services due to physical or attitudinal barriers. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
2. Limited Access to Employment Opportunities: People with disabilities may encounter discrimination in the workplace, leading to limited access to job opportunities, promotions, and career advancement. This can result in financial difficulties and dependence on others for support.
3. Inadequate Healthcare: Individuals with disabilities may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, including specialized medical care, rehabilitation therapies, or assistive devices. These barriers can lead to poorer health outcomes and reduced quality of life.
4. Stigma and Discrimination: People with disabilities may experience stigma and discrimination, which can result in lower self-esteem, reduced confidence, and social exclusion. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
5. Lack of Inclusive Housing Options: Individuals with disabilities may encounter difficulties in finding accessible and affordable housing options, leading to overcrowding, substandard living conditions, or homelessness.
6. Limited Access to Education and Training: People with disabilities may face barriers in accessing educational resources, including inadequate accommodations, lack of support services, or discrimination. This can limit their opportunities for skill development and career advancement.
7. Financial Difficulties: Individuals with disabilities may encounter financial difficulties due to limited access to employment opportunities, higher living expenses, or inadequate financial support. This can lead to poverty and dependence on others for survival.
8. Lack of Representation and Voice: People with disabilities may be underrepresented in decision-making processes, leading to a lack of understanding and support for their needs and rights. This can result in policies and practices that perpetuate inequality and discrimination.
