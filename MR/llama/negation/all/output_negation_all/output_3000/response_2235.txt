Ensuring that the healthcare needs of beginner non-English speaker lower-class people are met can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for healthcare providers to help them understand and respect the cultural beliefs and practices of diverse patient populations, including those who may not speak English fluently.
2. Language Access Services: Ensure that interpretation and translation services are available and easily accessible to patients who do not speak English. This can include on-site interpreters, telephone interpretation services, and translated materials.
3. Patient Navigation: Train healthcare navigators or patient advocates who can help non-English speaking patients navigate the healthcare system, including scheduling appointments, understanding test results, and filling prescriptions.
4. Health Education: Develop culturally appropriate health education materials and programs that are accessible to non-English speakers. This can include visual aids, videos, and interactive presentations.
5. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and partnership with organizations that serve diverse populations, such as community health centers, religious organizations, and social service agencies.
6. Technology Solutions: Utilize technology solutions such as telemedicine, mobile health apps, and online patient portals to reach patients who may not have access to traditional healthcare services.
7. Collaboration with Other Organizations: Collaborate with other organizations that serve non-English speaking populations, such as community health clinics, social service agencies, and advocacy groups.
8. Health Literacy: Provide health literacy materials in the patients' native language or use plain language to make health information more accessible.
9. Training for Providers: Provide training for healthcare providers on how to communicate effectively with patients who may not speak English fluently, including active listening and cultural sensitivity.
10. Patient-Centered Care: Prioritize patient-centered care by involving patients in the decision-making process and respecting their preferences and values.

By implementing these strategies, healthcare providers can help ensure that the healthcare needs of beginner non-English speaker lower-class people are met and that they receive high-quality, culturally competent care.
