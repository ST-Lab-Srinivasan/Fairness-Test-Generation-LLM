Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals who are not civilians, specifically those who have gone through multiple divorces, requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Understand the unique challenges: It's essential to understand the specific challenges faced by individuals who have gone through multiple divorces. These challenges may include emotional trauma, financial instability, social isolation, and difficulty trusting others. Programs should be designed to address these challenges directly.
2. Focus on supportive environments: Create community programs that foster a supportive and non-judgmental environment. This can be achieved by providing safe spaces for individuals to share their experiences and emotions without fear of criticism or rejection.
3. Offer flexible participation options: Accommodate the diverse needs of participants by offering flexible program participation options, such as online sessions, in-person meetings, or a combination of both. This can help individuals who may have difficulty attending traditional in-person programs due to various reasons, including mobility issues or work commitments.
4. Provide practical resources and tools: Offer practical resources and tools that can help individuals manage their daily lives and build resilience. Examples include financial management training, job skills workshops, and legal assistance.
5. Encourage collaboration and networking: Organize events and activities that encourage collaboration and networking among participants. This can help build a sense of community and support, which is particularly important for individuals who may be feeling isolated or disconnected from society.
6. Address stigma and discrimination: Work to address any stigma or discrimination associated with divorce and remarriage. Programs should promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity, recognizing that individuals who have gone through multiple divorces are not inherently flawed or less deserving of support.
7. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that program planning and implementation involve diverse perspectives, including those of individuals who have gone through multiple divorces themselves, as well as professionals with expertise in relevant areas (e.g., psychology, social work, law). This can help ensure that programs are tailored to meet the specific needs and experiences of participants.
8. Provide ongoing support: Offer ongoing support to program
