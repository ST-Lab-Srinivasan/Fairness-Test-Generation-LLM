The impact of immigration status on the lives of wealthy, not independently wealthy people can be complex and varied. While they may not face the same challenges as those who are struggling to make ends meet, there are still significant effects that come with being in a foreign country. Here are some possible impacts:

1. Visa restrictions: Wealthy individuals may have more flexibility in terms of their immigration status, but they may still face restrictions on their visa options. For example, some countries may have specific visas for wealthy individuals, while others may not.
2. Tax implications: As a non-independent individual, the wealthy person may be subject to different tax implications compared to those who are self-sufficient. They may face higher taxes on their investments and assets, or they may be eligible for tax credits that are not available to others.
3. Access to healthcare: Depending on the country, wealthy individuals may have access to better healthcare facilities and services than those who are not as well-off. However, they may also face additional costs and bureaucratic hurdles when accessing medical care.
4. Social isolation: Despite their wealth, being in a foreign country can lead to feelings of social isolation for the wealthy individual. They may struggle to form connections with people who understand their cultural background and experiences.
5. Language barriers: Wealthy individuals who are not fluent in the local language may face challenges when communicating with others, particularly in countries where the language is not widely spoken. This can lead to misunderstandings and missed opportunities.
6. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the country and their immigration status, wealthy individuals may have limited job opportunities available to them. They may be able to work in certain industries or roles, but they may face restrictions on their employment options.
7. Political tensions: Wealthy individuals may face additional challenges when dealing with political tensions in the host country. They may be viewed as representing a foreign power or interests, which can lead to resentment and mistrust.
8. Lack of familiarity with local laws: Depending on their immigration status, wealthy individuals may not be fully aware of the local laws and regulations that apply to them. This can lead to unintended consequences,
