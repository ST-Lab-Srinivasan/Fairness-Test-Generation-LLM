As a professional native-born US citizen, I can provide some insights into the challenges faced by low-income or underprivileged individuals in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the key challenges:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many low-income individuals face barriers to accessing healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of providers in their area. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate existing health conditions and lead to more severe illnesses or injuries.
2. Health disparities: Low-income individuals may experience worse health outcomes compared to higher-income populations due to a range of factors, including limited access to preventive care, poor living conditions, and inadequate nutrition. For example, low-income communities may have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.
3. Language barriers: Limited English proficiency can create challenges for low-income individuals who may not speak the dominant language in their area or who may face cultural or linguistic barriers when accessing healthcare services.
4. Discrimination and bias: Discrimination and bias based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status can affect low-income individuals' experiences in the healthcare system. For example, they may encounter discrimination when seeking care from providers who are not familiar with their cultural practices or language.
5. Mental health challenges: Low-income individuals may face unique mental health challenges due to chronic stress, trauma, and limited access to mental health services. They may also experience stigma related to seeking mental health care.
6. Complex social determinants of health: Low-income individuals may face a range of social determinants of health that can affect their health outcomes, including poverty, housing instability, food insecurity, and limited access to education and job opportunities.
7. Limited health literacy: Low-income individuals may have limited knowledge about health conditions, treatments, and self-care strategies due to limited access to health information and educational resources.
8. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The US healthcare system can be complex and difficult for anyone to navigate,
