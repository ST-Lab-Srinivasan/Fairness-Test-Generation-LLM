Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent beginners in Chinese speaking communities is crucial for promoting social integration and breaking down language barriers. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide multilingual signage: Ensure that public spaces have signs and information available in multiple languages, including the local language and simplified Chinese characters for non-independent beginners. This will help individuals navigate public spaces more easily and access essential information without feeling left out.
2. Offer language classes or workshops: Organize language classes or workshops specifically designed for non-independent beginners. These sessions can provide a supportive environment where learners can practice speaking, listening, and reading in Chinese.
3. Hire bilingual staff: Train existing public sector employees, such as librarians, teachers, or customer service representatives, to speak both the local language and simplified Chinese characters. This will create a more inclusive environment for non-independent beginners who may not be proficient in the local language.
4. Use visual aids: Utilize pictures, diagrams, or videos to convey information in public spaces, especially those that are not easily communicable through spoken language alone. This can help non-independent beginners understand and navigate public spaces more effectively.
5. Provide audio guides: Offer audio guides for public attractions, museums, or cultural events that provide a description of the surroundings in both the local language and simplified Chinese characters. Non-independent beginners can use these guides to explore and enjoy public spaces without feeling left out.
6. Create multilingual cultural programs: Organize cultural events or festivals that offer programming in multiple languages, including simplified Chinese characters. This will allow non-independent beginners to participate and appreciate the cultural heritage of the community more fully.
7. Partner with language exchange organizations: Collaborate with local language exchange groups to provide opportunities for non-independent beginners to practice speaking Chinese in a supportive environment. These events can help build confidence and improve language skills, making public spaces more inclusive.
8. Install audio induction loops: For individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, install audio induction loops in public spaces such as courts, town halls, and libraries. This will enable them to hear information more clearly
