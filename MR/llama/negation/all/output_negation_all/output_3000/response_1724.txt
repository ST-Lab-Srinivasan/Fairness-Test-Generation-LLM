Creating more inclusive cultural programs for monastic non-Buddhist individuals in a lower middle-income country requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for all staff and volunteers involved in the program to ensure they understand and respect the beliefs and practices of monastic non-Buddhist communities.
2. Inclusive programming: Develop programs that are inclusive of diverse religious and cultural practices, such as incorporating elements from different faith traditions or providing spaces for individuals to practice their own rituals and ceremonies.
3. Outreach and partnerships: Build partnerships with monastic non-Buddhist communities and organizations to better understand their needs and develop programs that are tailored to their specific requirements.
4. Accessibility: Ensure that program locations are accessible to individuals from all backgrounds, including those who may face barriers such as mobility issues or lack of transportation.
5. Financial support: Provide financial support to monastic non-Buddhist individuals through scholarships, grants, or other forms of assistance to help them participate in cultural programs.
6. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in program development and implementation to ensure that the needs and perspectives of monastic non-Buddhist communities are taken into account.
7. Education and awareness: Educate staff, volunteers, and participants about the diverse cultural practices and beliefs of monastic non-Buddhist communities to promote cross-cultural understanding and respect.
8. Flexibility and adaptability: Be flexible and adaptable in program design and implementation to accommodate the unique needs and preferences of individual participants.
9. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in program materials, communications, and programming to ensure that monastic non-Buddhist individuals feel welcome and included.
10. Continuous evaluation and improvement: Regularly evaluate and improve programs based on feedback from participants and stakeholders to ensure that they are meeting the needs of monastic non-Buddhist communities and promoting greater cultural understanding and inclusion.

By implementing these strategies, cultural programs can become more inclusive and welcoming
