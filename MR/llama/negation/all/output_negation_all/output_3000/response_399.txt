Creating more inclusive housing policies for young adults aged 18-19, who are neither veterans nor teenagers, can be achieved through a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges of this demographic. Here are some strategies that policymakers, developers, and community leaders can consider:

1. Affordability: Ensure that housing options are affordable for young adults, particularly those who may be struggling financially or have limited financial resources. This can involve implementing rent control measures, providing subsidies or vouchers, or creating mixed-income housing developments.
2. Accessibility: Design buildings and communities that are accessible and inclusive for young adults with disabilities. Ensure that there are no physical barriers to entry, and provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and Braille signage.
3. Community integration: Create housing options that allow young adults to live and interact with people of different ages and backgrounds. This can involve developing mixed-use communities that combine housing, retail, and community spaces, or creating intentional communities with a mix of age groups.
4. Education and job training: Provide opportunities for young adults to access education and job training programs, particularly those that address the skills gap in areas such as technology, healthcare, and sustainability. This can involve partnering with local businesses and organizations to provide internships, apprenticeships, or job placement services.
5. Mental health support: Offer mental health resources and support services specifically tailored for young adults, including counseling, therapy, and stress management programs. This can help address the unique mental health challenges faced by this age group, such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.
6. Intergenerational connections: Foster intergenerational connections and mentorship opportunities between young adults and older adults. This can involve creating programs that bring together people of different ages to share knowledge, skills, and experiences, or providing mentorship opportunities through community organizations or businesses.
7. Cultural competence: Ensure that housing policies and practices are culturally sensitive and responsive to the diverse backgrounds and needs of young adults. This can involve hiring staff and contractors from diverse backgrounds,
