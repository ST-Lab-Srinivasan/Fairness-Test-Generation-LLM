The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who are not recently single can be significant and far-reaching. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face barriers in social interactions, such as difficulty navigating public spaces or communicating with others. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can negatively impact mental health and overall well-being.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Depending on the nature and severity of their disability, some permanent residents may face barriers in accessing educational opportunities or finding employment. This can limit their ability to achieve financial stability and independence.
3. Health disparities: People with disabilities may experience poorer health outcomes due to a lack of access to healthcare services or inadequate healthcare provision. This can result in higher rates of chronic conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease, and lower life expectancy.
4. Discrimination and stigma: Unfortunately, many people with disabilities still face discrimination and stigma in their daily lives. This can lead to feelings of low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety.
5. Lack of representation and voice: Historically, the voices and experiences of people with disabilities have been underrepresented in society. This can result in a lack of understanding and empathy from able-bodied individuals, perpetuating negative attitudes towards disability.
6. Financial hardship: Depending on the nature and severity of their disability, some permanent residents may face significant financial challenges due to increased costs related to healthcare, assistive technology, or accommodations in the workplace.
7. Limited access to transportation: Many people with disabilities face barriers in accessing transportation, such as inadequate public transportation options or a lack of accessible vehicles. This can limit their ability to participate in social and economic activities.
8. Housing discrimination: People with disabilities may face discrimination when seeking housing, such as difficulty finding accessible units or being denied housing due to their disability status.
9. Limited access to recreational activities: Depending on the nature of their disability, some permanent residents may face barriers in accessing recreational activities, such as sports teams
