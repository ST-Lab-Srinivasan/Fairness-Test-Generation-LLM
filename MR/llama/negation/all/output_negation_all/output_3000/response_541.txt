Addressing the Needs of Non-Lifelong, Non-Single, and Non-Conservative Individuals in Disaster Response:

Disaster response efforts often focus on providing aid to affected communities, but it's crucial to consider the diverse needs of non-lifelong, non-single, and non-conservative individuals. These groups face unique challenges during disasters, and their needs may not be adequately addressed by traditional disaster response strategies. Here are some ways to address these needs:
