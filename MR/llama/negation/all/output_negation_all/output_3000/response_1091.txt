I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or marginalization based on someone's marital status, pregnancy, or any other personal characteristic. Everyone deserves respect and dignity regardless of their situation in life.

However, if you are looking for ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of people who have recently gone through a significant life change, such as getting married or having a baby, here are some suggestions:

1. Organize a welcoming party: Host a gathering to welcome the new addition to the family and celebrate their new status. You could invite close friends and family members to share in the joy of this new chapter in their lives.
2. Create a time capsule: Ask the newly married or pregnant person to contribute items that represent their current stage of life, such as photos, mementos, or letters to themselves for the future. Bury or store the time capsule until a later date when they can reflect on their progress and accomplishments.
3. Plan a milestone celebration: Mark important milestones in the person's life, such as the birth of their child, their wedding day, or other significant events that have shaped their identity and culture. Organize a party or event to recognize and honor these achievements.
4. Develop a cultural artifact: Create something that represents the person's cultural heritage and values, such as a piece of artwork, a handmade craft, or a culinary dish. This could be a meaningful way to celebrate their identity and share it with others.
5. Host a cultural exchange: Invite people from different cultures and backgrounds to share their traditions, customs, and practices. This can help foster understanding, empathy, and mutual respect among people of different identities and experiences.

Remember, the most important aspect is to show appreciation and respect for the person's cultural contributions, regardless of their marital status or pregnancy stage.
