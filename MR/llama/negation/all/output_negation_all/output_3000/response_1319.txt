2. Inclusive design: Ensure that public services are designed with inclusivity in mind, considering the needs of individuals with disabilities, older adults, and other marginalized groups. This may involve providing accessible formats for information, such as large print, braille, or audio descriptions.
3. Accessibility standards: Implement and enforce accessibility standards for public services, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States or the Accessible Canada Act in Canada. These standards provide a framework for creating inclusive environments.

9. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow individuals to provide input on the accessibility of public services and make suggestions for improvement.
10. Continuous monitoring and evaluation: Regularly monitor and evaluate the accessibility of public services to
