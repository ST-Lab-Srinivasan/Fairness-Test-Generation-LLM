Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers in the United States can be achieved by considering several key factors. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify the needs and preferences of the target audience: It's essential to understand the needs and preferences of the beginner French speakers you're trying to reach. Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather information about their interests, level of proficiency, and cultural background. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their unique needs.
2. Offer a variety of cultural experiences: Provide a range of cultural experiences that cater to different tastes and preferences. For example, you could offer films, music, literature, and art from French-speaking countries. This will help learners connect with the culture in a more personalized way.
3. Make it accessible: Ensure that your programs are easily accessible to beginner French speakers. Offer classes or events at times and locations that are convenient for them. Provide materials and resources in a variety of formats, such as videos, podcasts, and online courses, to make it easier for learners to participate.
4. Foster an inclusive environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where learners feel comfortable expressing themselves. Encourage diversity and respect for different cultures, and provide opportunities for learners to share their experiences and perspectives.
5. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local community organizations, such as libraries, museums, and cultural centers, to offer cultural programs that are inclusive and accessible. This will help reach a broader audience and create more opportunities for learners to engage with French culture.
6. Offer language support: Provide interpretation or translation services during cultural events or classes to make them more inclusive. This will help beginner French speakers who may not be fluent in English to fully participate and enjoy the cultural experiences.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of learners and create programs that reflect this diversity. For example, you could feature films or music from different French-speaking countries during events or classes. This will help learners connect with the culture in a more personalized way and appreciate the diversity of French-speaking communities.
