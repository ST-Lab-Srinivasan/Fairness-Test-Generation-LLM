Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native Arabic speakers who are not part of a democratic society. Here are some ways:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage is an essential aspect of identity formation for many native Arabic speakers. It provides a sense of belonging and connection to their ancestors, history, and traditions. This identity is often deeply rooted in the Arabic language and culture.
2. Community cohesion: In non-democratic societies, cultural heritage can serve as a unifying factor for communities that share a common language and cultural practices. It fosters a sense of belonging and solidarity among community members, who often rely on shared cultural traditions to navigate social and political contexts.
3. Resistance and protest: Cultural heritage can also be used as a form of resistance and protest in non-democratic societies. By drawing upon their cultural traditions and practices, individuals can challenge dominant power structures and assert their rights and freedoms. For example, singing national anthems or reciting poems in Arabic can be a powerful statement of defiance against oppressive regimes.
4. Cultural preservation: In many non-democratic societies, cultural heritage is at risk of being lost or erased due to political and social pressures. By preserving their cultural practices and traditions, native Arabic speakers can ensure that their history and identity are not forgotten or suppressed.
5. Intergenerational transmission: Cultural heritage is often transmitted from one generation to the next through oral tradition, storytelling, and other cultural practices. This intergenerational transmission helps to maintain cultural continuity and ensures that the cultural traditions of native Arabic speakers are not lost over time.
6. Conflict resolution: Cultural heritage can also play a role in conflict resolution within non-democratic societies. By drawing upon shared cultural practices and traditions, individuals can find common ground and work towards peaceful resolutions to conflicts.
7. Economic development: Cultural heritage can be leveraged for economic development in non-democratic societies. For example, tourism can be a significant source of revenue for communities that preserve and promote their cultural heritage.
8. International relations: Cultural heritage can also play a role in international relations
