As a beginner non-English speaker native natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system:

6. Difficulty Navigating the Court System: Non-English speakers may find it difficult to navigate the court system, particularly if they are not familiar with the procedures and rules of the court. This can lead to confusion, frustration, and delays in legal proceedings.
