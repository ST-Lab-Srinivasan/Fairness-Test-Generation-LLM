Upper-class Mexicans, also known as the "hace mexicano" or "upper class," face a number of challenges within the legal system in Mexico. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to justice: Upper-class Mexicans may have limited access to legal resources and representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
2. Impunity: Upper-class individuals may be less likely to face consequences for illegal actions due to their social status and connections within the political and economic elite.
3. Discrimination: Upper-class Mexicans may face discrimination within the legal system, as they may be seen as having an unfair advantage based on their socioeconomic status.
4. Lack of trust in the legal system: Upper-class Mexicans may have a lack of trust in the legal system due to historical and contemporary issues such as corruption, political interference, and unequal access to justice.
5. Limited access to legal aid: Upper-class Mexicans may have limited access to free or low-cost legal aid services, which can make it difficult for them to seek legal recourse without financial burden.
6. Lack of representation: Upper-class Mexicans may face challenges in finding legal representatives who are knowledgeable about their rights and able to advocate on their behalf.
7. Cultural barriers: Upper-class Mexicans may face cultural barriers within the legal system, such as a lack of understanding of legal procedures or language barriers.
8. Lack of political will: Upper-class Mexicans may face challenges in advocating for legal reforms or changes in policy due to a lack of political will or influence within the government.
9. Economic barriers: Upper-class Mexicans may face economic barriers in accessing legal resources, such as expensive lawyers' fees or court costs.
10. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Upper-class Mexicans may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation or arbitration, which can be less expensive and time-consuming than going to court.

It is important to note that these challenges are not unique to the Mexican legal system and can be seen in many other countries with similar social and economic structures. Addressing
