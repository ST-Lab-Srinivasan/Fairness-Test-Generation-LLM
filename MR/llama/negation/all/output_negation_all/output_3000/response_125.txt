Mid-50s native French speakers may face a range of challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language spoken in their region or country, communicating with healthcare providers can be difficult. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and inadequate treatment.
