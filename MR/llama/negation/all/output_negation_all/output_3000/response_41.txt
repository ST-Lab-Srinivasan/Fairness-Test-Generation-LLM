The legal rights of non-divorced, non-civilian individuals are protected in several ways:

1. Equal Protection Under the Law: The US Constitution guarantees all individuals equal protection under the law, regardless of their marital status or civilian status. This means that non-divorced, non-civilian individuals have the same rights and protections as everyone else under the law.
2. Discrimination Prohibitions: Federal laws prohibit discrimination based on marital status and civilian status in areas such as employment, education, housing, and public accommodations. This means that non-divorced, non-civilian individuals cannot be treated unfairly or differently than other individuals because of their marital status or civilian status.
3. Privacy Rights: Non-divorced, non-civilian individuals have the right to privacy and confidentiality when it comes to their personal information, including their marital status and civilian status. This means that they cannot be forced to disclose this information without their consent, and they cannot be denied rights or privileges based solely on their marital status or civilian status.
4. Family and Medical Leave Act: The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for certain family and medical reasons, including the serious health condition of a spouse, domestic partner, or civil union partner. This means that non-divorced, non-civilian individuals have the right to take leave from work to care for their loved ones, regardless of their marital status or civilian status.
5. Social Security Benefits: Non-divorced, non-civilian individuals are eligible for Social Security benefits based on their own earnings history, as well as the earnings history of their spouse or civil union partner. This means that they can receive survivor benefits if their spouse or civil union partner passes away, and they can also receive spousal benefits if they are married to someone who is receiving Social Security benefits.
6. Inheritance Rights: Non-divorced, non-civilian individuals have the right to inherit property and assets from their spouses or civil union partners, just as anyone else would in a traditional marriage
