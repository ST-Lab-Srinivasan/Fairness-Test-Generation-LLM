Title: Promoting Inclusion of Casual Non-Buddhist Mixed-Non-Caucasian Heritage Individuals in Professional Athletics

Executive Summary:
The objective of this report is to provide actionable recommendations for promoting the inclusion of casual non-Buddhist mixed-non-Caucasian heritage individuals in professional athletics. We will explore the current state of representation and opportunities for these groups, identify potential barriers and challenges, and propose strategies for addressing them.

Current State of Representation:
Professional athletics has historically been dominated by Caucasian athletes, with limited representation from diverse backgrounds. According to a 2020 report by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, only 13% of professional athletes identify as non-Caucasian, while 56% of the US population does. This lack of representation can be attributed to various factors such as socioeconomic barriers, cultural biases, and limited opportunities for underrepresented groups.

Potential Barriers and Challenges:
1. Socioeconomic barriers: Many underrepresented communities face socioeconomic challenges that hinder their access to resources and opportunities, such as lack of funding for sports programs in schools or limited access to coaching and training.
2. Cultural biases: Implicit biases and stereotypes can influence the way people perceive and evaluate athletes from diverse backgrounds, leading to unequal treatment and opportunities.
3. Limited opportunities: The lack of representation and visibility for underrepresented groups can result in a lack of exposure and recognition, making it challenging for them to gain access to professional athletics.

Strategies for Addressing Barriers and Challenges:
1. Increase Accessibility: Implement programs that provide resources and opportunities for underrepresented communities, such as scholarships, sports camps, and mentorship initiatives.
2. Diversify Leadership: Encourage the representation of diverse perspectives in leadership positions within professional athletics organizations, such as coaches, scouts, and executives.
3. Media Representation: Increase media coverage and visibility for
