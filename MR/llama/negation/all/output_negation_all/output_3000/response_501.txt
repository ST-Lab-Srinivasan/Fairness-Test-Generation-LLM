The impact of disability status on the lives of recently legalized, non-married individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: As a newly legalized individual, you may have access to healthcare services through Medicaid or other government programs. However, if you have a disability, you may face barriers in accessing appropriate healthcare due to discrimination, lack of accommodations, or insufficient funding.
2.

3. Social isolation: Disability status can lead to social isolation, as individuals with disabilities may experience discrimination, stigma, or lack of access to social opportunities. This can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and marginalization.
