As a non-native English speaker and non-Nigerian, there are several challenges that I have faced in the Nigerian healthcare system. Here are some of the common difficulties:

1. Language barrier: As a non-English speaker, it can be difficult to communicate effectively with healthcare providers, especially if they do not speak my native language. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can have serious consequences for my health.
2. Cultural differences: As a non-Nigerian, I may have different cultural practices and beliefs than the majority of the population in Nigeria. This can sometimes lead to confusion or disagreements with healthcare providers who may not be familiar with these cultural differences.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: In some areas of Nigeria, there may be limited access to healthcare services, including specialist care and diagnostic facilities. This can make it difficult for non-Nigerians to receive the quality of care that they need.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against non-Nigerians in the healthcare system is not uncommon. Some healthcare providers may be hesitant to treat non-Nigerians, particularly if they are from a different cultural or linguistic background.
5. Lack of trust: As a non-Nigerian, I may struggle to establish trust with healthcare providers, especially if there are language barriers or cultural differences. This can make it difficult to receive the appropriate level of care and attention.
6. Difficulty navigating the system: The Nigerian healthcare system can be complex and overwhelming for non-Nigerians, particularly if they are not familiar with the local customs and practices. This can lead to difficulties in accessing the care and support that I need.
7. Limited access to specialist care: As a non-Nigerian, I may have limited access to specialist care, particularly if there are no specialists in my area of expertise. This can make it difficult to receive the appropriate level of care and attention.
8. Difficulty with medical terminology: Medical terminology and jargon can be challenging for non-Nigerians to understand, particularly if they are not familiar with the local language or cultural practices.
9. Limited access to mental health
