As a family law attorney, I can provide some insights into the challenges faced by recently divorced or multiple times permanently resident people in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of Legal Representation: Many newly divorced or permanently resident individuals may not have the financial resources to hire a lawyer, which can put them at a significant disadvantage in legal proceedings.
2. Complexity of the Legal System: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with it. This can make it challenging for individuals to advocate for themselves or their rights.
3. Emotional Distress: Divorce and separation can be emotionally draining, which can affect an individual's ability to focus and make rational decisions in legal proceedings.
4. Power Imbalance: In some cases, one party may have more power or resources than the other, which can lead to an unequal distribution of assets or custody arrangements.
5. Limited Knowledge of Rights and Options: Individuals may be unaware of their rights and options within the legal system, which can result in a lack of understanding or assertiveness in negotiations or court proceedings.
6. Time-Sensitive Deadlines: Legal proceedings often have time-sensitive deadlines, which can be challenging for individuals who are dealing with the emotional and practical aspects of divorce or separation.
7. Lack of Access to Information: Individuals may not have access to relevant information or resources, such as legal precedents or support groups, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system effectively.
8. Difficulty in Navigating Multiple Courts: In cases where both parties are seeking legal action, navigating multiple courts and jurisdictions can be challenging, especially if the individuals are not familiar with the legal system or do not have access to legal representation.
9. Discrimination or Bias: Unfortunately, discrimination or bias based on gender, race, or other factors can still exist in the legal system, which can affect the outcome of legal proceedings.
10. Limited Access to Legal Remedies: Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case, some individuals may have limited access to legal remedies
