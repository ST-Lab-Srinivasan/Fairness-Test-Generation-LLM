Creating more inclusive social policies for working professional separated individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various challenges faced by this group. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the unique needs of separated professionals: Separated professionals often face discrimination and stigma, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization. To address this, policymakers must acknowledge and recognize the unique needs of this group and work towards creating a more inclusive society.
2. Provide access to affordable childcare: One of the biggest challenges faced by separated professionals is finding affordable childcare. Policymakers can help by providing subsidies or tax credits for childcare expenses, or by investing in community-based childcare programs that are more affordable and accessible.
3. Foster flexible work arrangements: Many separated professionals struggle to balance work and family responsibilities due to inflexible work schedules. Policymakers can encourage employers to offer flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or part-time work, that can help separated professionals manage their responsibilities more effectively.
4. Support financial stability: Separated professionals often face financial instability due to loss of income or unequal distribution of assets upon divorce. Policymakers can provide support through financial assistance programs or by advocating for policies that promote fair division of assets in divorce proceedings.
5. Promote mental health support: The separation process can be emotionally challenging, and many separated professionals may struggle with depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues. Policymakers can provide mental health support services or encourage employers to offer employee assistance programs (EAPs) that include mental health resources.
6. Advocate for gender equality: Women are disproportionately affected by separation, as they are more likely to bear the brunt of childcare and household responsibilities. Policymakers can advocate for gender equality policies that promote fair distribution of household and caregiving responsibilities between partners.
7. Provide access to education and training: Many separated professionals may lack access to education and training opportunities due to financial constraints or lack of support from their employer. Policymakers can provide funding for vocational training
