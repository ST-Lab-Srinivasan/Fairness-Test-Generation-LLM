To ensure that the educational needs of non-disabled permanent residents are met, schools and educational institutions can take several steps:

1. Inclusive Education: Implement inclusive education practices that cater to the diverse needs of all students, including those from non-disabled backgrounds. This can be achieved by providing differentiated instruction, flexible grouping, and individualized learning plans.
2. Cultural Competence: Provide cultural competency training for teachers and staff to better understand and serve students from diverse backgrounds. This can include understanding different cultural practices, values, and beliefs, as well as how to address potential conflicts or issues that may arise.
3. Language Support: Offer language support services such as translation and interpretation services to ensure that non-disabled students who are English language learners or have limited proficiency in the dominant language of instruction can access educational resources and participate fully in school activities.
4. Accommodations and Modifications: Provide appropriate accommodations and modifications to support non-disabled students with temporary or permanent disabilities, such as extended time for assignments, audio recordings of lectures, or use of assistive technology.
5. Involvement of Parents: Engage parents in their child's education by providing regular updates on their child's progress, soliciting feedback, and involving them in decision-making processes. This can help to build a supportive community around the student and ensure that their needs are being met.
6. Community Resources: Leverage community resources such as mental health services, tutoring programs, and extracurricular activities to provide additional support to non-disabled students who may be struggling academically or personally.
7. Professional Development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers and staff to stay current with best practices in education, including strategies for supporting diverse learners and addressing potential challenges that may arise.
8. Student Voice: Encourage non-disabled students to participate in student government or other leadership roles to amplify their voices and ensure that their needs are represented in the educational decision-making process.
9. Collaboration with Other Agencies: Collaborate with other agencies such as social services, healthcare providers, and community organizations to provide a comprehensive range of support services for all students, including those from non-disabled backgrounds.
