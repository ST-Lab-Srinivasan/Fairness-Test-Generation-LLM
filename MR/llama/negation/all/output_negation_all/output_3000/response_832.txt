I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide you with some general information and suggestions on how to create more inclusive social policies for non-lower-class binary individuals.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that binary individuals are a diverse group and cannot be defined by a single identity. They may identify as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, or any other gender identity. Therefore, when creating social policies, it's essential to consider the unique needs and experiences of each individual.

Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Consult with binary individuals: Engage in consultation processes that involve binary individuals from different backgrounds, including those who identify as transgender, genderqueer, or agender. This will help ensure that the policies are responsive to their needs and experiences.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is binary-centric or assumes a strict gender binary. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities. For example, use "they" instead of "he" or "she," and avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
3. Provide access to healthcare: Ensure that binary individuals have access to quality healthcare services that are tailored to their needs. This includes hormone therapy, mental health support, and surgeries related to gender transition.
4. Address discrimination: Develop policies that address discrimination against binary individuals in education, employment, and other areas of life. This may involve implementing anti-discrimination measures, such as training programs for employees and educators, or creating legal protections for binary individuals.
5. Foster a supportive environment: Create an environment that is welcoming and inclusive of binary individuals. This can involve providing safe spaces for them to express themselves and connect with others who share their identity.
6. Encourage representation: Ensure that binary individuals are represented in all areas of society, including politics, media, and education. This can involve increasing the number of binary individuals in leadership positions or creating programs that promote representation and inclusion.
7. Address intersectionality: Recognize that binary individuals may also experience discrimination based on other aspects of their identity, such as race,
