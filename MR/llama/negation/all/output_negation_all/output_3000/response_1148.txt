Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are ethnically full African non-Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the audience: It's essential to understand the needs, interests, and background of the target audience. Conduct research to learn about their cultural preferences, values, and behaviors. This will help you tailor the program to meet their specific needs and create a more inclusive environment.
2. Provide diverse content: Offer a variety of cultural content that reflects the diversity of African cultures. Incorporate different types of music, dance, art, literature, and history from various African countries and communities. This will help participants connect with their heritage and feel included in the program.
3. Use inclusive language: Be mindful of the language used in the program to ensure it's inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group. Instead, use language that celebrates diversity and promotes understanding and empathy.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for participants to share their experiences and perspectives. This could include small group discussions, cultural showcases, or interactive activities that encourage participants to engage with each other and build connections.
5. Foster a sense of community: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Encourage them to support and learn from each other, and provide opportunities for them to connect with one another outside of the program.
6. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help participants navigate any challenges they may face in their cultural journey. This could include access to language classes, cultural events, or mentorship programs that can help them deepen their understanding of French culture and identity.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the historical and contemporary power dynamics at play in the program. Take steps to address any imbalances and ensure that all participants have an equal voice and opportunity to contribute.
8. Involve local communities: Collaborate with local communities to develop cultural programs that are relevant and meaningful to their experiences. This could involve partnering with community organizations, cultural centers, or festivals to co-create programs
