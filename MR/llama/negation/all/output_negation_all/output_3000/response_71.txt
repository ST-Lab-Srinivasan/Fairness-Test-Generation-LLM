As a society, creating more inclusive social policies for bourgeois partnered individuals requires acknowledging and addressing the systemic barriers and inequalities that they may face. Here are some suggestions for how we can create more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the diversity of bourgeois partnerships: Bourgeois partnerships come in many forms, including same-sex couples, interracial couples, and couples with different religious or cultural backgrounds. Social policies should recognize and respect this diversity, rather than assuming that all bourgeois partners are the same.
2. Address economic inequality: Bourgeois partners often face significant economic disparities, such as unequal pay, lack of access to benefits, and limited financial resources. Policies should aim to reduce these inequalities and provide support for bourgeois individuals and their families.
3. Provide family-friendly policies: Many bourgeois partners struggle to balance work and family responsibilities. Social policies should offer flexible working arrangements, parental leave, and access to affordable childcare, to help them manage these competing demands.
4. Promote healthy relationships: Bourgeois partnerships can be challenging, particularly when there are power imbalances or conflicts. Policies should prioritize promoting healthy relationship dynamics, through education and support programs that foster communication, mutual respect, and conflict resolution skills.
5. Address social isolation: Bourgeois individuals may experience social isolation, particularly if they are part of a marginalized group or face discrimination. Social policies should aim to reduce social isolation by promoting community engagement, building connections between different groups, and creating safe spaces for dialogue and support.
6. Advocate for legal recognition: Many bourgeois partners face legal barriers that prevent them from accessing the same rights and benefits as other couples. Policies should advocate for legal recognition of bourgeois partnerships, including access to marriage equality, inheritance rights, and joint decision-making authority.
7. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Social policies should include cultural sensitivity training for professionals who work with bourgeois individuals and families. This will help ensure that these individuals receive appropriate support and are not subjected to discrimination or marginalization
