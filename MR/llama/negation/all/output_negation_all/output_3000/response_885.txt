Creating more inclusive cultural events for agnostic non-not liberal individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the audience: Start by understanding the demographics of the individuals you want to attract to your event. What are their interests? What are their values? What are their pain points? Knowing your audience will help you tailor your event to meet their needs and preferences.
2. Offer diverse programming: Create a program that includes a variety of cultural events, such as music, dance, art, and food. Make sure the events are inclusive and representative of different cultures and communities.
3. Provide accommodations for different beliefs and practices: Be aware of the religious and cultural practices of your audience and make arrangements to accommodate them. For example, provide halal or kosher food options, or have a quiet room for those who want to pray.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for attendees to participate in the event by engaging in activities such as workshops, panel discussions, or interactive installations. This will help create a sense of ownership and belonging among attendees.
5. Foster inclusive language and behavior: Use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and beliefs. Avoid stereotyping or making assumptions about individuals based on their cultural background.
6. Collaborate with diverse partners: Partner with organizations that represent different communities to help co-create the event. This will ensure that the event is representative of a wide range of perspectives and experiences.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in the event and take steps to mitigate any potential issues. For example, ensure that the event is not dominated by one particular group or culture.
8. Provide accessibility features: Make sure the event is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and braille materials.
9. Create a safe space: Ensure that the event creates a safe and welcoming environment for all attendees. Have a clear policy on harassment and discrimination and take steps to prevent any incidents from occurring.
