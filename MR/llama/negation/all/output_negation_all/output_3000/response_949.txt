5. Access to microfinance: Provide access to microfinance programs that offer small loans or other financial services to help them start a business or cover unexpected expenses.
6. Networking opportunities: Organize networking events and connect them with successful entrepreneurs, investors, and professionals in their desired field to help them build valuable connections and gain insights into the civilian job market.
7. Mentorship programs: Pair them with experienced mentors who can provide guidance on career transitions, job searching, and professional development.
8. Skills assessment and certification: Offer skills assessments and certifications to help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, which can be used to enhance their employability in the civilian job market.
