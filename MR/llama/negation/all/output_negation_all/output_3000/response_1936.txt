2. Offer career development resources: Empower Native Americans with the tools and resources they need to succeed in their chosen careers. This could include networking events, job fairs, or online resources such as career counseling or professional certification programs.
3. Advocate for inclusive hiring practices: Encourage businesses and organizations to adopt inclusive hiring practices by prioritizing Native American candidates in their recruitment efforts. This could involve partnering with local tribal organizations or working directly with employers to promote diversity and inclusion.

Organizations can offer training programs, mentorship opportunities, or small business loans specifically targeted at Native American entrepreneurs.

This could involve working with elected officials or partnering with advocacy groups to advance Native American rights.
8. Support community-based initiatives: Many Native American communities have their own unique strengths, traditions, and cultural practices. Organizations can support community-based initiatives that promote cultural preservation, economic development, or social cohes
