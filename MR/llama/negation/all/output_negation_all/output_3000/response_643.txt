The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of late teens to early 20-year-old active-duty military personnel can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased healthcare costs: Genetic conditions can lead to increased healthcare costs for the individual, including medical expenses, prescription medications, and possibly even long-term disability payments.
