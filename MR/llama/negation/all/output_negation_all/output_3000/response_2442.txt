Introduction:
Marriage is an important social institution that can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals. In Mexico, the cultural and societal expectations surrounding marriage can be particularly pronounced, especially during pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently late pregnancy (third trimester) Mexican individuals. Specifically, we will examine how marital status affects physical and mental health, social support networks, and overall well-being during this critical period of life.

Methods:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A sample of 100 pregnant women in their third trimester will be recruited from obstetric clinics in Mexico City. Participants will complete a questionnaire assessing their marital status, physical and mental health, social support networks, and overall well-being. In addition, a subset of participants will participate in in-depth interviews to provide more detailed insights into their experiences.

Results:
Our findings suggest that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of pregnant women in Mexico during the third trimester. Compared to unmarried women, married women reported better physical health and mental well-being, as well as stronger social support networks. Married women were also more likely to receive prenatal care and have access to resources such as transportation and childcare. In contrast, unmarried women reported higher levels of stress and anxiety, as well as difficulty accessing healthcare services.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the importance of marital status in shaping the experiences of pregnant women in Mexico during the third trimester. Marriage appears to provide a range of benefits, including improved physical and mental health, stronger social support networks, and greater access to resources. These findings have implications for healthcare providers and policymakers seeking to improve the well-being of pregnant women in Mexico.
