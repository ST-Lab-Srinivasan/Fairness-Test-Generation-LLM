Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarians, not recently singles, and other marginalized groups requires intentional effort and consideration. Here are some strategies to make your cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Understand and acknowledge the diversity of your community: Recognize that your community is made up of individuals with diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and identities. Acknowledge the historical and contemporary experiences of marginalized groups in your area, and be mindful of how these experiences may impact their participation in cultural celebrations.
2. Involve diverse voices: Ensure that the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations involves a diversity of voices, including those from marginalized communities. This can help ensure that the celebration is responsive to the needs and interests of these groups.
3. Create safe spaces: Provide safe and inclusive spaces for individuals who may feel marginalized or excluded during cultural celebrations. This could include designated areas for people of different genders, races, sexual orientations, or abilities.
4. Offer accommodations: Make sure that your cultural celebrations are accessible to all, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or wheelchair accessibility.
5. Celebrate diverse cultures: Incorporate diverse cultural traditions and practices into your celebrations. This could include honoring the cultural heritage of marginalized groups through music, dance, art, or food.
6. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and histories of marginalized communities, and share this knowledge with others. Encourage others to do the same, and work towards creating a more inclusive and empathetic society.
7. Be mindful of language and symbols: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or hurtful to marginalized groups. Be respectful of cultural practices and traditions, and avoid appropriating elements of these cultures without proper understanding or permission.
8. Foster inclusive participation: Encourage all members of your community to participate in cultural celebrations, regardless of their background or identity. Provide opportunities for individuals to share their perspectives and experiences, and create spaces for open dialogue and mutual understanding.
