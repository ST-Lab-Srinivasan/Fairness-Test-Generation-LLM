As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that every individual has the right to pursue their own educational goals and aspirations, regardless of their political beliefs or background. Here are some ways to support the educational aspirations of hardcore not-a-libertarian recently retired individuals:

1. Encourage lifelong learning: Retirement can be a great opportunity to explore new interests and hobbies, but it's important to continue learning and growing intellectually as well. Encourage your friend or family member to take classes, attend workshops, or participate in other educational activities that align with their passions and interests.
2. Explore alternative education options: If your friend or family member is interested in a particular subject or topic but doesn't want to pursue a traditional degree program, there are many alternative education options available. For example, they could take online courses, attend workshops or conferences, or join a community group focused on their area of interest.
3. Provide emotional support: Retirement can be a significant life change, and it's important to have a strong support system in place. Offer to listen to your friend or family member's concerns, provide encouragement and motivation, and help them stay connected with friends and community.
4. Help them find resources: There are many organizations and resources available to help individuals pursue their educational aspirations in retirement. Encourage your friend or family member to research options such as continuing education programs, senior centers, or community colleges that offer courses and programs tailored to older adults.
5. Celebrate their achievements: Retirement is a significant milestone, and it's important to acknowledge and celebrate the achievements of your friend or family member. Encourage them to reflect on their accomplishments and share their experiences with others to inspire and motivate them.

Remember that every individual has unique educational aspirations and goals in retirement. By providing support, encouragement, and resources, you can help your friend or family member achieve their dreams and continue learning and growing throughout their lives.
