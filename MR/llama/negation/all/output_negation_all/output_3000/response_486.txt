Supporting the social inclusion of physically disabled monastic non-Buddhist people requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some ways to promote their inclusion:

1. Accessibility modifications: Ensure that the monastery premises are accessible to people with disabilities. This may involve installing ramps, widening doorways, and providing Braille signage.
2. Adaptive practices: Develop adaptive practices and rituals that cater to the needs of physically disabled monastics. For example, provide seating options for those who cannot stand for long periods or offer alternative ways to participate in meditation or prayer.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all interactions, avoiding terms that may be offensive or marginalizing. Instead of asking "How did you lose your legs?", ask "How are you feeling today?"
4. Education and awareness: Educate the monastic community about disability etiquette and the importance of inclusivity. Organize workshops or training sessions to promote understanding and empathy.
5. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair physically disabled monastics with able-bodied monastics. This can help build relationships, foster understanding, and provide support.
6. Technology integration: Utilize technology to facilitate participation from those who may have difficulty accessing the monastery due to mobility issues. For instance, provide virtual meditation sessions or create an app for remote prayer requests.
7. Interfaith dialogue: Engage in interfaith dialogue and collaboration with other religious communities to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can help break down barriers and foster a more inclusive environment.
8. Advocacy: Advocate for the rights and inclusion of physically disabled monastics within their religious community and society at large. Partner with disability organizations to amplify their voices and promote change.
9. Accommodation options: Provide accommodation options for physically disabled monastics, such as specially designed rooms or apartments, that cater to their specific needs.
10. Support networks: Establish support networks within the monastery, connecting physically disabled monastics with others who share similar experiences. This can help build a sense of community and reduce
