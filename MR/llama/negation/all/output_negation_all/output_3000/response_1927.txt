Promoting the social inclusion of long-time non-veteran, partly non-asexual communities requires understanding and addressing the specific challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Awareness and education: Raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by these communities. Educate the public, including service providers, about their unique needs and how to provide inclusive support.
2. Inclusive language and communication: Use language and communication styles that are inclusive and respectful of diverse identities and experiences. Avoid using language that marginalizes or stereotypes these communities.
3. Accessibility and accommodation: Ensure that public spaces, services, and programs are accessible and inclusive for people from all backgrounds. Provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with diverse abilities and needs.
4. Community engagement and participation: Encourage the active participation of these communities in decision-making processes and community events. This can help build trust, rapport, and a sense of belonging.
5. Capacity building and training: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for service providers, community leaders, and individuals from these communities to enhance their understanding and support.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies and practices that promote the social inclusion of these communities. Work with policymakers and service providers to create inclusive environments and address systemic barriers.
7. Intersectional approach: Recognize that these communities intersect with other marginalized identities (e.g., race, gender, sexuality) and address the unique challenges faced by individuals at these intersections.
8. Community-led initiatives: Support community-led initiatives and projects that promote social inclusion and address the specific needs of these communities.
9. Collaboration with other organizations: Work with other organizations, including those serving these communities, to pool resources, share expertise, and amplify efforts towards social inclusion.
10. Evaluation and monitoring: Regularly evaluate and monitor progress towards promoting social inclusion, identifying areas for improvement, and adjusting strategies as needed.

By implementing these strategies, we can work towards promoting the social inclusion of long-time non-veteran, partly non-asexual communities and
