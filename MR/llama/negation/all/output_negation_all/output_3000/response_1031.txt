Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of strong individuals from non-Asian heritage backgrounds, particularly those who identify as mixed race or non-binary. Mentorship can provide these individuals with a sense of belonging, validation, and support, which are essential for building self-esteem and confidence.

Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to the development of strong mixed non-Asian heritage people:

1. Identity exploration: Mentors can help mentees explore their identity and cultural background, providing a safe space to discuss experiences and feelings related to their mixed or non-binary identity. This can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and one's place in the world.
