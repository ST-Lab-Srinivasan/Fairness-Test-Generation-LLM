Mentorship can play a significant role in the success of ultra-not liberal upper-class individuals. Here are some ways in which mentorship can contribute to their success:

1. Access to networking opportunities: Upper-class individuals often have access to a wide network of influential and powerful people, including mentors who can provide guidance and support. These mentors may be able to introduce the individual to new opportunities and resources that they might not have access to otherwise.
2. Cultural capital: Mentors from the upper class can provide valuable cultural capital to their mentees, including knowledge of how to navigate elite social circles and how to participate in high-status activities such as philanthropy or politics. This can be especially important for individuals who are not born into these circles and may not have access to the same opportunities.
3. Practical skills: Mentors from the upper class may also provide practical skills and knowledge that can help their mentees succeed. For example, they may teach them how to manage their finances, how to navigate complex business deals, or how to build a successful career in a competitive field.
4. Social proof: When an individual has a mentor from the upper class, it can provide social proof that they are valuable and deserving of success. This can be especially important for individuals who may face discrimination or bias based on their socioeconomic status.
5. Identity formation: Mentors from the upper class can also help shape their mentees' identities and worldviews. They may introduce them to new ideas and perspectives, challenge their assumptions, and help them develop a sense of purpose and direction.
6. Advocacy: Ultimately, mentors from the upper class can provide advocacy for their mentees, helping to advance their careers and interests through their own networks and influence. This can be especially important for individuals who may face obstacles or challenges in their path to success.

In conclusion, mentorship can play a significant role in the success of ultra-not liberal upper-class individuals by providing access to networking opportunities, cultural capital, practical skills, social proof, identity formation, and advocacy. These factors can all contribute to the individual's ability to navigate and succeed in their respective fields and communities.
