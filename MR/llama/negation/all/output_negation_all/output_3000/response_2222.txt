To promote the educational success of non-traditional or "binary" students (those who are not newly married), institutions of higher education can take several strategies:

1. Create a supportive environment: Establish a welcoming and inclusive campus culture that recognizes and values the diverse experiences and backgrounds of binary students. Provide resources and support services specifically tailored to their needs, such as counseling, academic advising, and social events.
2. Flexible academic programs: Offer flexible academic programs that accommodate the unique needs of binary students. For example, allow them to take a break from their studies or adjust their course load as needed without penalty. Provide options for part-time or distance learning to help balance school with other responsibilities.
3. Financial support: Offer financial aid and scholarships specifically designed for binary students. This can include grants, loans, and work-study programs that acknowledge their non-traditional status and help them cover the costs of higher education.
4. Childcare and family-friendly policies: Provide on-campus childcare services or partnerships with local providers. Offer flexible parenting policies, such as parental leave, flexible work arrangements, and remote work options, to support binary students who are also parents.
5. Campus resources and referrals: Connect binary students with resources both on and off campus that can help them navigate the challenges of higher education while balancing family responsibilities. This can include tutoring services, academic support programs, and referrals to local community organizations offering childcare, healthcare, and other essential services.
6. Advocacy and awareness: Raise awareness about the unique needs and challenges faced by binary students on campus. Advocate for policies and practices that promote their success, such as accommodating family-friendly spaces, flexible scheduling options, and inclusive curricula that reflect the diversity of their experiences.
7. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that provide services to binary students and their families, such as food banks, health clinics, and childcare providers. This can help bridge gaps in support and create a more comprehensive network of resources for these students.
8. Mentorship and peer support: Connect binary students with
