Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals and their families, particularly in developing countries like Mexico where access to healthcare and social services may be limited. In this study, we aimed to explore the experiences and impacts of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions among Mexican people.

Methods:
We conducted a qualitative study using focus groups and interviews with 20 carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers. The inclusion criteria were individuals aged 18 years or older who carried a genetic condition and lived in Mexico.

Results:
Our findings revealed several impacts of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico, including:

1. Social isolation: Many participants reported feeling isolated and stigmatized due to their disability status. They felt that they were often excluded from social events and gatherings, and experienced difficulty forming and maintaining relationships.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Participants faced barriers in accessing education and employment opportunities due to their disability status. Many reported feeling unable to pursue their desired careers or participate in activities they enjoyed due to physical limitations.
3. Financial difficulties: Carriers of genetic conditions often experienced financial difficulties, including reduced income and increased healthcare costs. This was particularly challenging for those living in poverty, who may struggle to afford basic necessities let alone medical care.
4. Emotional burden: The emotional burden of living with a genetic condition was significant, with many participants reporting feelings of sadness, anxiety, and depression. This was often exacerbated by societal stigma and discrimination.
5. Lack of support: Participants reported a lack of support from family, friends, and healthcare providers. They felt that their needs were not being met, particularly in terms of mental health support and access to assistive devices.
6. Limited access to healthcare: Many participants faced barriers in accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints or geographic isolation. This resulted in delayed diagnosis and treatment, which could exacerbate the condition and negatively impact quality of life.
