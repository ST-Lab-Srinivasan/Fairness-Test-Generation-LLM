Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants or non-immigrants who have not been through a divorce can be a challenging task, but there are several ways to help them feel more integrated into society. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language classes: Offer language classes or provide resources for language learning, especially if the person is new to the country and needs to improve their English skills.
2. Cultural orientation: Organize cultural orientation programs that introduce the person to American customs, values, and ways of life. This can help them understand the unwritten rules of society and avoid any misunderstandings or offense.
3. Social events: Host social events, such as potluck dinners, game nights, or movie nights, where the person can meet other people and build connections in a relaxed atmosphere.
4. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage the person to get involved in volunteer work, which can help them meet new people and develop a sense of purpose. This can also be a great way to learn about American culture and society.
5. Mentorship: Pair the person with a mentor who can provide guidance and support as they navigate their new life in the US. The mentor can help answer questions, provide advice, and introduce the person to new experiences.
6. Community resources: Provide information about community resources, such as healthcare services, educational institutions, and government agencies, that can help the person access the support they need.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion in the community, such as language access services, cultural competency training for service providers, and inclusive hiring practices.
8. Education and awareness: Educate the person about their rights and responsibilities as a member of society, as well as the importance of respecting and valuing diversity. This can help them feel more confident and empowered in their new environment.
9. Intergenerational connections: Facilitate connections between the person and older generations, such as through senior centers or intergenerational programs, which can provide a valuable opportunity for learning and connection-building.
10. Celebrating cultural heritage: Organize events that celebrate the person's cultural heritage, such as traditional food festivals, music performances
