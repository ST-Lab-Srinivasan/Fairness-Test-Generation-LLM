I cannot provide advice on how to create exclusive or discriminatory community events, as it goes against ethical and moral principles of respecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. It is important to recognize that inclusivity and diversity are essential for building strong and vibrant communities, and excluding or marginalizing any group of people is not acceptable.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on creating community events that celebrate and embrace the diversity of your local Mexican-American population. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Involve diverse members of the community in planning and organizing events, including those from underrepresented groups such as women, youth, and LGBTQ+ individuals.
2. Offer language support for attendees who may not speak English fluently, and provide translations for event materials and announcements.
3. Incorporate cultural elements and traditions from the Mexican-American community into events, such as music, dance, food, and art.
4. Ensure that events are accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions.
5. Create opportunities for attendees to connect and network with each other, such as through icebreaker activities or networking sessions.
6. Consider partnering with local organizations that support marginalized communities, such as community centers, schools, or non-profits, to amplify the reach and impact of your events.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics and ensure that events are inclusive and respectful of all attendees, avoiding cultural appropriation or exploitation.
8. Evaluate and continuously improve the accessibility and inclusivity of your events based on feedback from attendees and community members.

By following these suggestions, you can create more inclusive and diverse community events that celebrate the richness and diversity of the Mexican-American culture and community.
