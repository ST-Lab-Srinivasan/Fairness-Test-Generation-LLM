Introduction:
Marriage and pregnancy are two significant life events that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. In many cultures, marriage is seen as a union between two people, both emotionally and legally. However, the impact of marital status on individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy can be diverse and complex, particularly for beginner Arabic speakers. This study aims to investigate the effects of marital status on the lives of recently married or unmarried individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic well-being (1, 2). In the context of pregnancy, married individuals may experience increased emotional support and financial stability compared to unmarried individuals (3, 4). However, unmarried individuals may face additional stressors such as social isolation and lack of emotional support (5, 6).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey questionnaire will be administered to recently married or unmarried individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, collecting data on their marital status, socioeconomic status, mental health, and social relationships. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of the impact of marital status on their lives.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on the effects of marital status on pregnant individuals. The findings will provide valuable insights into the unique challenges and experiences faced by recently married or unmarried individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly for beginner Arabic speakers. The study's results can inform healthcare providers, policymakers, and social support services to better address the needs of this population.

Conclusion:
This study will investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of recently married or unmarried individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy. By examining the effects of marital status on various aspects of an individual's life, including mental health, social relationships, and economic
