Ensuring that the healthcare needs of individuals with genetic conditions who are native to the United States but are not immigrants is crucial for promoting equity and access to care. Here are some strategies that can help meet these needs:

1. Culturally Competent Care: Provide culturally competent care that takes into account the unique cultural and social experiences of Native American communities.
