Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of Native Americans who are not immigrants to the US and are not high-income professionals. Here are some ways in which cultural diversity can have this impact:

1. Preservation of Traditions: Cultural diversity allows Native Americans to preserve their traditional practices, beliefs, and customs. These traditions are an essential part of their identity and heritage, and they provide a sense of belonging and connection to their community.
2. Increased Cultural Awareness: Exposure to different cultures can increase awareness and appreciation of the rich cultural heritage of Native Americans. This can help break down stereotypes and promote understanding and respect for their traditions and beliefs.

6. Community Building: Cultural diversity can help build strong, vibrant communities among Native Americans. It provides a shared sense of identity and purpose, and it fosters a sense of belonging and connection to one's community.
