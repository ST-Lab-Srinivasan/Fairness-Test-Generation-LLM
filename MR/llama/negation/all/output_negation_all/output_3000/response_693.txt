Promoting the artistic expression of culturally non-Hindu beginner Arabic speakers can be a rewarding and enriching experience for both the individuals and the community. Here are some ways to encourage and support their artistic expression:

1. Create a safe space: Establish a welcoming and inclusive environment where beginners feel comfortable expressing themselves. This could be through regular gatherings, workshops, or cultural events.
2. Offer language classes: Provide beginner Arabic language classes tailored to their needs and interests. This will help them develop the skills they need to express themselves creatively in Arabic.
3. Encourage storytelling: Collect stories from beginners about their experiences, culture, and identity. Facilitate workshops where they can practice sharing these stories through various forms of expression, such as writing, poetry, or performance.
4. Foster collaboration: Pair beginners with more experienced Arabic speakers or artists to collaborate on creative projects. This will not only provide guidance but also foster a sense of community and mutual support.
5. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the unique perspectives and experiences of each individual, and encourage them to express themselves authentically. Avoid imposition of cultural or linguistic norms that may hinder their creativity.
6. Provide resources: Offer access to materials, such as books, films, or music, that can inspire and inform their artistic expression. Encourage them to explore different genres and styles to find what works best for them.
7. Support performance opportunities: Organize events where beginners can showcase their creative work, whether through spoken word, music, dance, or other forms of performance. This will help build confidence and provide a platform for self-expression.
8. Create an online community: Establish an online space where beginners can connect with each other, share their work, and receive feedback and support. This could be through social media groups, blogs, or even dedicated websites.
9. Foster intercultural exchange: Organize events that bring together Arabic learners from different cultural backgrounds. Encourage them to share their perspectives, traditions, and artistic expressions to foster mutual understanding and respect.
