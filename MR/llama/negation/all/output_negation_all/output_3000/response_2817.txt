Carriers of genetic conditions, including those who practice non-Hindu religions, may face unique challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the challenges that carriers of genetic conditions may encounter:

3. Language barriers: Carriers of genetic conditions who do not speak the dominant language in their region may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis.
4. Limited access to care: Non-Hindu carriers may face barriers to accessing medical care due to financial constraints or lack of availability of specialized services.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Carriers of genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination within their communities, which can lead to social isolation and mental health issues.
6. Lack of support systems: Non-Hindu carriers may not have access to support groups or resources that can help them cope with the emotional and psychological impact of living with a genetic condition.
7. Difficulty in navigating the healthcare system: Carriers of genetic conditions may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system, particularly if they are not familiar with the language or culture of the healthcare providers.
8. Limited availability of genetic counseling and testing: Non-Hindu carriers may have limited access to genetic counseling and testing services, which can make it difficult for them to understand their condition and make informed decisions about their health.
