Ensuring the healthcare needs of lower-class people in China, especially those who are beginners in speaking Chinese, can be challenging due to various socioeconomic barriers. However, there are several strategies that can be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase accessibility: Make healthcare services more accessible to lower-class people by establishing clinics or hospitals in their communities. This can be done by partnering with local organizations or governments to provide affordable healthcare options.
2. Provide language support: Offer interpretation and translation services for patients who are beginners in speaking Chinese. This can include providing bilingual staff, using visual aids, or utilizing technology such as telemedicine platforms to facilitate communication.
3. Culturally sensitive care: Train healthcare providers to be culturally sensitive and aware of the unique needs of lower-class people. This can involve learning about their cultural beliefs and practices, as well as being sensitive to any language or communication barriers they may have.
4. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the importance of healthcare and how to access it. This can be done through partnerships with local organizations, schools, and community centers.
5. Collaboration with NGOs: Partner with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that specialize in providing healthcare services to marginalized communities. These organizations often have a better understanding of the needs of lower-class people and can provide valuable support.
6. Financial assistance: Offer financial assistance programs to help lower-class people cover the costs of healthcare services, such as deductibles, co-pays, or prescription medication. This can be done through partnerships with insurance companies, government agencies, or non-profit organizations.
7. Telemedicine: Utilize telemedicine platforms to provide remote consultations and monitoring for patients who may face barriers in accessing healthcare services. This can be particularly useful for lower-class people living in rural areas or those with mobility issues.
8. Patient navigation: Implement patient navigation programs to help patients navigate the complex healthcare system, including finding providers, scheduling appointments, and understanding their treatment options.
