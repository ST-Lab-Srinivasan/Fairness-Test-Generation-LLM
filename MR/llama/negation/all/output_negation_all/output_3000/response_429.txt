Creating more inclusive community events for beginner non-English speaker elite upper-class people requires careful planning and consideration of their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide translation support: Offer translation services during the event, either through live interpreters or by providing written translations of important materials such as event posters, programs, and announcements.
2. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, videos, and presentations to help communicate information and ideas, especially if you are relying on verbal communication.
3. Simplify language: Avoid using complex vocabulary or jargon that may be unfamiliar to non-English speakers. Instead, use simple language and clear explanations to ensure everyone can understand the content.
4. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for event organizers and volunteers on how to interact with people from different cultures and backgrounds. This can help create a more inclusive environment.
5. Use technology: Utilize technology such as mobile apps, websites, or social media platforms to provide additional support and resources to non-English speakers. For example, you could create a language translation app that attendees can use to communicate with each other.
6. Incorporate interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities into the event that do not rely solely on verbal communication, such as group games or activities that involve physical participation.
7. Provide accessibility accommodations: Ensure that the event location is accessible to people with disabilities and provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
8. Offer childcare services: If the event is family-friendly, consider offering childcare services to help attendees who may have young children accompanying them.
9. Use diverse marketing channels: Promote the event through a variety of marketing channels to reach a wider audience, including social media, email marketing, and local newspapers or magazines that cater to non-English speakers.
10. Engage with the community: Reach out to local community groups or organizations that serve non-English speaker populations to promote the event and encourage attendance.
