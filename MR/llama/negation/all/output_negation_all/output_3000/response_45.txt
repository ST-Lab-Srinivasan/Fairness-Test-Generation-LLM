As a non-native French speaker, you may face several challenges when navigating the French legal system. Here are some common difficulties that slightly older beginners (in their 50s) may encounter:

1. Language barrier: Depending on your level of proficiency in French, you might struggle to understand legal terminology and concepts. This can make it harder for you to read and interpret legal documents, attend court hearings, or communicate with lawyers and other legal professionals.
