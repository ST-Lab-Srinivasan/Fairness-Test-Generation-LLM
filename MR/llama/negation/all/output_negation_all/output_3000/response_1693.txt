4. Economic Empowerment: Provide access to economic empowerment programs, such as job training, microfinance, and entrepreneurship support, to help community members build financial stability and independence.
5. Education and Advocacy: Offer educational programs and advocacy services to raise awareness about the needs and experiences of recently immigrated or mixed non-Asian heritage communities. This can help build support and understanding among broader society.
6. Mental Health Support: Provide mental health support services, such as counseling and therapy, to help community members cope with the challenges of migration and cultural adjustment.
7. Community Building: Organize community events and activities that promote social connection and integration among community members. This can help build a sense of belonging and belonging among recently immigrated or mixed non-Asian heritage communities.
