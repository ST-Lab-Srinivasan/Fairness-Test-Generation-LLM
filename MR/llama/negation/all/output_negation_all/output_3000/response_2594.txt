Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-widowed, non-mentally disabled individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural program is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, sign language interpreters, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, avoiding terms that are offensive or marginalizing.
3. Representation: Ensure that the cultural program reflects the diversity of the community, including individuals from different racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. Provide opportunities for underrepresented groups to participate and contribute to the program.
4. Participatory approach: Encourage participation from all individuals, using interactive and collaborative techniques that allow everyone to contribute and feel involved.
5. Sensitivity training: Provide sensitivity training for staff and volunteers to help them understand and appreciate the needs of diverse groups, including non-widowed, non-mentally disabled individuals.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible in accommodating different needs and preferences, such as providing alternative formats (e.g., braille or large print) for materials or allowing individuals to participate in the program at their own pace.
7. Collaboration: Collaborate with organizations that serve non-widowed, non-mentally disabled populations to co-create and deliver cultural programs that are inclusive and meet their needs.
8. Awareness campaigns: Launch awareness campaigns to educate the community about the importance of inclusivity in cultural programs and encourage participation from underrepresented groups.
9. Inclusive marketing: Use marketing strategies that are inclusive and respectful, avoiding language or imagery that could be offensive or marginalizing.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of your cultural programs in promoting inclusivity and gather feedback from participants to identify areas for improvement.
