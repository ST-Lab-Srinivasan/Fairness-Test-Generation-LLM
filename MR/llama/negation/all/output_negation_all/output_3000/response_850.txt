Promoting the accessibility of public services for devout non-Muslims in Muslim-majority countries or communities can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to make these services more inclusive and accessible. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all public communications, including signs, brochures, and announcements. Avoid using language that may be offensive or exclusionary to non-Muslims.
2. Accessible facilities: Ensure that public facilities such as restrooms, prayer rooms, and other services are accessible to people of all faiths. Provide clear signage and make sure that the facilities are clean and well-maintained.
3. Training for staff: Provide training for staff on how to interact with people of different faiths and cultures. This can help ensure that non-Muslims feel welcome and respected in public spaces.
4. Multilingual services: Provide multilingual services, including announcements, signs, and other communications, to cater to the language needs of non-Muslims.
5. Accommodation for religious practices: Make sure that there are adequate facilities for non-Muslims to practice their own religions, such as prayer rooms or worship spaces.
6. Education and awareness: Educate both Muslims and non-Muslims about the importance of inclusivity and respect for different faiths and cultures. This can help promote a more harmonious and inclusive society.
7. Community outreach: Reach out to non-Muslim communities through events, workshops, and other initiatives to build bridges of understanding and promote mutual respect.
8. Inclusive governance: Ensure that government policies and practices are inclusive and take into account the needs of non-Muslims. This can help create a more equitable and just society.
9. Encouraging dialogue: Facilitate dialogue and discussion between Muslims and non-Muslims to promote mutual understanding and respect.
10. Addressing discrimination: Address any instances of discrimination or marginalization faced by non-Muslims in public spaces, and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society.
