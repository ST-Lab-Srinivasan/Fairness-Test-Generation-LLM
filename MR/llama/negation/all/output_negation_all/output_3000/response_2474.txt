Highlighting the achievements of non-widowed, long-term permanent residents can be challenging, as it may seem unfair to draw attention to their accomplishments when others have faced significant life events. However, there are ways to acknowledge and celebrate their achievements without detracting from the experiences of widows or other groups:

1. Focus on individual successes: Instead of comparing achievements, highlight the unique strengths and accomplishments of each person. Emphasize their personal growth and contributions to society.
2. Celebrate milestones: Recognize significant events in their lives, such as anniversaries, career advancements, or personal achievements. This can be done through small gatherings or public acknowledgments.
3. Avoid comparisons: Refrain from comparing non-widowed individuals to widows or other groups. Focus on their individual experiences and accomplishments instead of drawing comparisons.
4. Provide support: Offer support and resources to help non-widowed individuals who may be facing challenges in their personal or professional lives. This can include mental health services, career guidance, or financial assistance.
5. Create inclusive environments: Ensure that social events and gatherings are inclusive and welcoming for all individuals, regardless of their marital status or length of time as a permanent resident.
6. Recognize the value of diversity: Celebrate the diversity of experiences and backgrounds among non-widowed individuals, and recognize the unique perspectives and contributions they bring to society.
7. Avoid tokenization: Be mindful not to tokenize or stereotype non-widowed individuals based on their marital status or length of time as a permanent resident. Treat them as valuable members of the community without making assumptions about their experiences.
8. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair non-widowed individuals with experienced professionals or mentors who can offer guidance and support in their personal and professional lives.
9. Provide resources for growth: Offer workshops, training sessions, or other resources that can help non-widowed individuals develop new skills or advance in their careers.
10. Foster a sense of community: Encourage the creation of a supportive community where non-widowed individuals can connect with others and build meaning
