1. Inclusive Curriculum Design: Develop curricula that cater to the diverse needs of all students, including those from marginalized groups. This includes incorporating diverse perspectives, experiences, and histories into the curriculum.
2. Accessible Learning Environments: Ensure that learning environments are accessible and inclusive for all students, including those with disabilities or other accessibility needs. Provide appropriate accommodations and support services to ensure equal access to education.
