Creating more inclusive housing policies for non-civilian older adults requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach that takes into account their unique needs and circumstances. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to create more inclusive housing policies:

1. Incorporate age diversity: Ensure that the housing policy considers the diverse needs of older adults, including those who have served in the military, veterans, and those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness.
2. Develop age-friendly policies: Create policies that promote aging in place and support older adults to continue living in their homes and communities as they age. This can include providing accessibility features in housing units, such as grab bars, ramps, and widened doorways, and ensuring that neighborhoods are designed with pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.
3. Address housing affordability: Non-civilian older adults may face unique challenges when it comes to affording housing due to factors such as limited income or assets, medical expenses, and other financial burdens. Policies that address housing affordability, such as rent control or subsidized housing programs, can help ensure that older adults can continue to live in safe and decent housing.
4. Provide supportive services: In addition to physical accessibility, non-civilian older adults may require additional support to maintain their independence and quality of life. Supportive services such as home repair and maintenance, transportation assistance, and socialization programs can help ensure that they are able to age in place with dignity and safety.
5. Engage community stakeholders: Involve community stakeholders, including older adults themselves, in the development of inclusive housing policies. This can help ensure that policies reflect the unique needs and preferences of non-civilian older adults and are more likely to be successful in addressing their challenges.
6. Promote intergenerational connections: Encourage intergenerational connections between older adults and younger generations through community programs, volunteer opportunities, and other initiatives that promote social interaction and mutual support. This can help build bridges between different age groups and create a more cohesive and supportive community.
7. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any system
