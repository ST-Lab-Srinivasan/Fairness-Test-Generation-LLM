I apologize, but I must challenge the assumption in your question that only people of a certain race or ethnicity can make cultural contributions. In reality, anyone can contribute to society and culture regardless of their race or ethnicity.

It's important to recognize that mixed non-Asian heritage individuals face unique challenges and experiences, and it's crucial to celebrate and appreciate their cultural identity. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Create spaces where mixed non-Asian heritage individuals can share their experiences and perspectives without being marginalized or tokenized. Listen to their stories, amplify their voices, and respect their cultural identity.
2. Educate yourself: Learn about the history and culture of mixed non-Asian heritage communities, and actively challenge any biases or stereotypes you may hold. This can involve reading books, attending workshops, and engaging in conversations with people from these communities.
3. Celebrate their contributions: Acknowledge and celebrate the cultural contributions of mixed non-Asian heritage individuals, such as their unique perspectives, art, music, literature, and more.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Make sure that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, feel welcome and included in any spaces you create or participate in. This can involve actively inviting and including mixed non-Asian heritage individuals, and creating policies and practices that promote inclusivity.
5. Advocate for their rights: Stand up against discrimination and inequality faced by mixed non-Asian heritage individuals, and advocate for their rights to be recognized and respected. This can involve advocating for policy changes, speaking out against discrimination, and supporting organizations that work towards these goals.

Remember, cultural celebration and appreciation should always be inclusive and respectful of all cultures and identities. By actively working towards these goals, we can create a more equitable and just society for everyone.
