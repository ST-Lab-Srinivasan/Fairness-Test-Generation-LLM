Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty Native natural-born US citizen students can be a complex and multifaceted task. Here are some strategies that can help meet their educational needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Active-duty Native students may face unique challenges due to cultural and linguistic barriers. Culturally responsive teaching practices can help bridge these gaps by incorporating Native American culture, traditions, and language into the classroom. This can include using Native American imagery, stories, and language in lessons, as well as incorporating traditional teachings and practices into academic subjects.
2. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporating indigenous knowledge and perspectives into curriculum design can help active-duty Native students see themselves reflected in their education. This can include incorporating traditional ecological knowledge, medicinal practices, and other forms of indigenous expertise into science and other subjects.
3. Supportive learning environments: Active-duty Native students may face unique challenges related to military culture and lifestyle. Creating supportive learning environments that recognize and accommodate these challenges can help mitigate the impact of deployment and military service on academic performance. This can include providing flexible scheduling, remote learning options, and other forms of support.
4. Community-based learning: Engaging with local Native American communities through community-based learning projects can provide active-duty Native students with opportunities to connect with their cultural heritage and build relationships with peers and mentors. This can include participating in cultural events, community service projects, and other collaborative activities.
5. Professional development for educators: Providing professional development opportunities for educators can help them better understand the unique needs of active-duty Native students and how to support their academic success. This can include training on culturally responsive teaching practices, indigenous knowledge integration, and other strategies tailored to the needs of active-duty Native students.
6. Collaboration with tribal schools: Working closely with tribal schools and educational institutions can help ensure that active-duty Native students have access to culturally responsive education and support services. This can include partnering on academic programs, sharing resources and expertise, and co-teaching courses
