Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for partially identifying as not non-binary and partly not asexual individuals requires acknowledging and respecting the complexity of their identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Be mindful of language: Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" or "women") when referring to people, instead use inclusive language that recognizes the diversity of gender identities. Use terms like "people," "individuals," or "communities."
2. Include non-binary and asexual representation: Make sure there are representations of non-binary and asexual individuals in cultural celebrations, such as having non-binary and asexual characters in festivals, parades, or other events. This can help create a sense of belonging and visibility for these communities.
3. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume someone's gender identity or sexual orientation based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask people how they identify and respect their preferences when planning cultural celebrations.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that cultural celebrations are accessible and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Provide gender-neutral bathrooms, offer non-binary options for dress codes, and create safe spaces for asexual individuals.
5. Engage with the community: Consult with members of the non-binary and asexual communities when planning cultural celebrations to ensure that their needs are met. This can involve seeking feedback through surveys or focus groups, hosting community events specifically for these groups, and incorporating their perspectives into the planning process.
6. Offer gender-neutral alternatives: Provide options for gender-neutral language and imagery when celebrating cultural holidays or events. For example, use "everyone" instead of "men" or "women," or feature non-binary or asexual characters in decorations or performances.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical marginalization of non-binary and asexual individuals and be aware of the power dynamics at play when planning cultural celebrations. Take steps to center their voices and experiences, such as prioritizing their representation or involving them in decision-making processes.
8. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and
