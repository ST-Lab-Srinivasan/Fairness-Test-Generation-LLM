Addressing the specific needs of Native American students, who are not immigrants to the US but have faced historical trauma and ongoing discrimination, requires a comprehensive approach that considers their cultural identity, language proficiency, and community involvement. Here are some strategies that educators can employ:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Incorporate Native American cultures, histories, and traditions into the curriculum. Provide opportunities for students to share their cultural practices and experiences in the classroom.
2. Language revitalization: Support the preservation of Native American languages by offering language classes or providing resources for students to learn their indigenous language(s). This can help students connect with their cultural heritage and improve their academic performance.
3. Community involvement: Involve local Native American communities in educational initiatives through partnerships, guest speakers, and cultural events. This can help students feel more engaged and motivated in their education.
4. Identity-based learning: Encourage students to explore their identity and connect it to their academic studies. Provide opportunities for students to reflect on how their cultural background influences their experiences and perspectives.
5. Trauma-informed teaching: Acknowledge the historical trauma faced by Native American communities and provide support for students who may be dealing with intergenerational trauma. Incorporate healing practices, such as mindfulness or traditional healing methods, into the curriculum.
6. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair Native American students with successful role models from their community. This can provide students with a sense of belonging and support in their academic journey.
7. Cultural field trips: Organize field trips to cultural sites and events that are relevant to the student's identity. These experiences can help students deepen their understanding of their cultural heritage and build connections with their community.
8. Parent and family engagement: Involve parents and families in educational initiatives through workshops, meetings, and cultural events. This can help build a supportive network around the student and promote academic success.
9. Curriculum design: Develop curricula that reflect Native American histories, cultures, and perspectives. Incorporate local and indigenous knowledge into the teaching
