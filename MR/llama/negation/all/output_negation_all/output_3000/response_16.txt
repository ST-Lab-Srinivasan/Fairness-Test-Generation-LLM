Ensuring that the voices of beginner French speakers, who are ethnically full African non-Americans, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a safe space: Beginner French speakers may feel hesitant to participate in decision-making processes due to language barriers or feelings of inadequacy. Creating a safe and inclusive space where they feel comfortable expressing themselves is essential.
