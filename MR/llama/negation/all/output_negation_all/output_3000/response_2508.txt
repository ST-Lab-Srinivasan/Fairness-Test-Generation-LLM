Creating more inclusive social policies for openly strong not homosexual early teens (13-15 years old) requires understanding and addressing the unique challenges and discrimination that they may face based on their gender identity or expression. Here are some recommendations for creating a more inclusive society:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences of early teens who are not homosexual but may still face discrimination due to their gender identity or expression. This can help you better understand their challenges and provide appropriate support.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that reinforces binary gender norms or stereotypes, such as referring to someone as "boys" or "girls." Instead, use gender-neutral language like "everyone," "students," or "peers."
3. Create safe spaces: Ensure that all early teens feel comfortable and safe in school and other social settings. This can involve providing gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, or other private spaces where they can express themselves without fear of judgment or harassment.
4. Promote diverse representation: Include early teens from diverse gender identities in media, literature, and other forms of representation. This can help challenge stereotypes and promote understanding and acceptance of all gender identities.
5. Support mental health: Early teens who face discrimination or marginalization may experience higher rates of anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues. Ensure that they have access to mental health resources and support, such as counseling or therapy.
6. Advocate for policies that protect gender identity: Support policies that protect the rights of early teens to express their gender identity without fear of discrimination or violence. This can involve advocating for laws that prohibit bullying or harassment based on gender identity, as well as promoting inclusive education policies.
7. Engage with local communities: Work with local communities and organizations to promote awareness and understanding of early teens' experiences. This can involve organizing events, workshops, or other initiatives that bring people together to discuss issues related to gender identity and inclusion.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support specifically tailored to the needs of early teens who
