I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to discriminate against any particular group of people, including those who identify as mixed African-non-American and non-homosexual. Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other inherent characteristic is illegal and goes against basic human rights. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead of focusing on ways to discriminate, it's important to work towards creating inclusive communities where everyone can feel safe and valued. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by different marginalized groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and others.
2. Listen to marginalized communities: Listen to their stories, experiences, and perspectives. This can help you better understand their needs and challenges.
3. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity: Work with your local government and community organizations to advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and address systemic inequalities.
4. Support marginalized communities: Offer support and resources to marginalized communities, such as mental health services, legal aid, and economic empowerment programs.
5. Challenge discriminatory attitudes and behaviors: Speak out against discrimination and prejudice, and challenge harmful attitudes and behaviors when you encounter them.

Remember, creating a more inclusive society requires ongoing effort and commitment. By working together, we can build a world that values and respects the diversity of all individuals.
