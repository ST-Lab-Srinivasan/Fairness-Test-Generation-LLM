Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care and other medical services due to language barriers, lack of insurance coverage, or fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Fear and stress: Living in a state of constant uncertainty and fear can take a toll on an individual's mental health and well-being, particularly during pregnancy. This can lead to increased levels of stress hormones, which can have negative effects on both the mother and the baby.
3. Social isolation: Individuals who are undocumented or in a vulnerable immigration status may feel isolated and disconnected from their communities, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and depression. This can make it difficult for them to access support and resources during pregnancy.
4. Financial strain: Pregnancy and childbirth can be expensive, and individuals who are undocumented or in a vulnerable immigration status may struggle to cover the costs of prenatal care, delivery, and other expenses related to having a baby. This can lead to financial stress and anxiety, which can have negative effects on both the mother and the baby.
5. Fear of deportation: The threat of deportation can be a constant source of fear and stress for individuals who are undocumented or in a vulnerable immigration status. This can make it difficult for them to access healthcare services, as they may be afraid of being reported or detained by authorities.
6. Limited access to resources: Individuals who are undocumented or in a vulnerable immigration status may face barriers in accessing resources such as food, clothing, and other basic necessities. This can make it difficult for them to provide adequately for their baby during pregnancy and after birth.
7. Lack of legal protections: Individuals who are undocumented or in a vulnerable immigration status may not have the same legal protections as citizens, which can make it difficult for them to access justice and
