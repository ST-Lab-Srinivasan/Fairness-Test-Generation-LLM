Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are ethnically full African non-Americans requires careful consideration and a thoughtful approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Understand the diversity of African cultures: Africa is a vast and diverse continent with many different cultures, languages, and traditions. It's essential to recognize and respect this diversity when designing cultural programs for African non-Americans. Avoid making assumptions about someone's culture based on their race or ethnicity. Instead, ask questions and listen to the individual's experiences and perspectives.
2. Use inclusive language: Make sure that your language is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms that are offensive or stereotypical. For example, instead of referring to someone as "African American," ask them how they identify themselves (e.g., "What is your cultural background?" or "How do you identify?").
3. Represent a variety of African cultures: Include a range of African cultures in your programming to avoid perpetuating stereotypes and to show respect for the diversity of the continent. This could involve featuring different African artists, musicians, writers, and other cultural figures.
4. Provide context: Offer historical and cultural context to help participants understand the significance of the cultural practices and traditions you are presenting. This can help avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations.
5. Encourage participation: Incorporate interactive elements into your programs to encourage participation from all attendees. This could involve group discussions, role-playing activities, or other engaging exercises that allow everyone to contribute and learn.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in your cultural programs. Avoid perpetuating colonialism or other forms of oppression by recognizing and respecting the agency and expertise of the cultures you are presenting.
7. Collaborate with community members: Work with members of the African diaspora and other stakeholders to develop your cultural programs. This can help ensure that your programs are relevant, inclusive, and respectful.
8. Provide resources: Offer additional resources, such as books, films
