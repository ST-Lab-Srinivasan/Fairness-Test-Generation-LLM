Creating more inclusive social policies for wealthy, long-term, not widowed individuals requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the unique challenges faced by this group: Wealthy, long-term, not widowed individuals may face unique challenges that are not necessarily addressed by traditional social policies. For example, they may have different financial obligations or social expectations than others in their age group. Acknowledging these challenges and understanding the specific needs of this group can help inform policy decisions.
2. Focus on addressing income inequality: Wealthy individuals often have higher incomes than others, which can contribute to income inequality. Policies that address income inequality, such as progressive taxation or increasing the minimum wage, can help create a more level playing field for everyone.
3. Implement policies that support financial security: Many wealthy individuals may have a higher net worth than others due to their financial assets. However, they may still face financial insecurity due to market fluctuations or unexpected events.

4. Provide access to affordable healthcare: Wealthy individuals may have access to better healthcare options than others due to their financial resources. However, ensuring that everyone has access to affordable healthcare is essential for promoting overall well-being and reducing health disparities. Policies that expand access to affordable healthcare, such as implementing a universal healthcare system or increasing funding for community clinics, can help achieve this goal.
5. Address social isolation: Wealthy individuals may have more social connections than others due to their financial resources and social status. However, social isolation can affect anyone, regardless of wealth or social status. Policies that promote social connection and address social isolation, such as increasing funding for community programs or promoting volunteer opportunities, can help build stronger, more inclusive communities.
6. Promote intergenerational wealth transfer: Wealthy individuals may have the means to pass down their financial assets to future generations. Policies that promote intergenerational wealth transfer, such as tax incentives for inheritance or education programs for young people
