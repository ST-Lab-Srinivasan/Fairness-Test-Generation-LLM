Promoting the artistic expression of non-elderly, non-male, and non-lower middle-income individuals is essential to foster diversity and inclusivity in the arts. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide accessibility and opportunities: Make sure that people from diverse backgrounds have access to artistic spaces, resources, and training. Offer scholarships, grants, or free workshops to help underrepresented groups develop their skills.
2. Encourage diverse representation in arts institutions: Ensure that the leadership and staff of arts organizations reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. This can be achieved by actively seeking out and promoting candidates from underrepresented groups.
3. Showcase diverse art forms and artists: Programs that feature a wide range of art forms and artists can help promote inclusivity in the arts. This can include exhibitions, performances, and festivals that highlight the work of non-elderly, non-male, and non-lower middle-income individuals.
4. Create platforms for marginalized voices: Provide a platform for underrepresented artists to express themselves and share their perspectives. This can be achieved through mentorship programs, artist residencies, or community-based projects.
5. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address the structural barriers that prevent marginalized groups from participating in the arts. For example, provide affordable housing, childcare, and transportation options to make it easier for people to attend arts events.
6. Foster partnerships and collaborations: Collaborate with organizations that serve underrepresented communities to promote arts programming and create opportunities for cross-cultural exchange.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Work with policymakers to implement policies that promote diversity and inclusivity in the arts, such as funding programs that support underrepresented artists or providing tax incentives for arts organizations that prioritize diversity.
8. Educate and raise awareness: Engage in outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the importance of promoting diversity and inclusivity in the arts. This can involve working with schools, community groups, and other organizations to promote arts programming that reflects the diversity of the community.
