Regarding cultural heritage, it plays a significant role in shaping the identities and lives of people from diverse backgrounds. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation within a particular community or society. It can include aspects such as language, religion, art, music, and food, among others.

For beginner non-English speaker individuals, cultural heritage can serve as a source of comfort and familiarity in an unfamiliar environment. It can provide a sense of identity and belonging, especially during times of migration or displacement. Cultural heritage can also serve as a means of communication and connection with one's ancestors and community, transcending language barriers.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not the sole determinant of an individual's identity or worth. It is essential to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their cultural background or political beliefs. By promoting cross-cultural understanding and empathy, we can foster a more inclusive and harmonious society.
