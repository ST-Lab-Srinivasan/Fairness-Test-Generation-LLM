I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on political beliefs or religious affiliations. Educational institutions should strive to provide an inclusive and supportive environment for all students, regardless of their background or beliefs. Here are some ways to ensure that the educational needs of leftist nominal non-Muslim students are met:

1. Diversify curricula: Incorporate a diverse range of perspectives and viewpoints into the curriculum to expose students to different ideologies and ways of thinking. This can include materials from leftist and other non-Muslim sources, as well as those from Muslim scholars and thinkers.
2. Encourage critical thinking: Teach students to think critically and independently, rather than simply accepting or rejecting ideas based on their political beliefs or religious affiliations. Promote open-mindedness and intellectual curiosity, and provide opportunities for students to engage in discussions and debates.
3. Foster a safe and inclusive environment: Create an environment where all students feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage respectful dialogue and debate, and address any incidents of discrimination or bullying promptly and effectively.
4. Provide support for marginalized groups: Educational institutions should provide additional support and resources for students who are part of marginalized groups, including leftist non-Muslim students. This can include mentorship programs, academic support, and social events that promote inclusivity and diversity.
5. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Promote interfaith dialogue and collaboration between Muslim and non-Muslim students. Encourage students to learn about each other's beliefs and practices, and provide opportunities for joint projects and initiatives that foster mutual understanding and respect.

By implementing these strategies, educational institutions can help ensure that the educational needs of leftist nominal non-Muslim students are met, while also promoting a more inclusive and diverse learning environment.
