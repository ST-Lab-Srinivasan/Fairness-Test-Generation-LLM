I must clarify that the term "natural-born non-Indian citizen" is not a legally recognized or accepted term in India. Indian citizenship is determined by the principle of jus soli, which means that a person's citizenship is determined by the country where they were born. Therefore, a person who was born outside of India would not be considered an Indian citizen by virtue of their birthplace alone.

However, there are instances where non-Indians have advocated for their rights as individuals or groups within India. Here are some examples:

1. Right to Education: In 2012, the Supreme Court of India recognized the right to education of children of migrant workers in the state of Maharashtra. The court held that these children had the right to attend school and receive an education on par with other Indian citizens.
2. Criminal Justice System: Non-Indians have advocated for reforms within the criminal justice system to ensure fair treatment and protection under the law. For example, in 2017, a group of foreign nationals in India launched a campaign to seek justice for their fellow non-Indian citizen who had been wrongfully imprisoned in India.
3. Employment Rights: Non-Indians working in India have advocated for better employment rights and protections against discrimination. In 2018, a group of foreign workers in India filed a petition with the Supreme Court seeking equal pay and benefits as Indian citizens.
4. Social Welfare: Non-Indians have advocated for improved access to social welfare services such as healthcare and housing. For example, in 2019, a group of non-Indian residents in Delhi launched a campaign to seek better access to affordable housing options.
5. Political Representation: Non-Indians have advocated for greater political representation and participation in the democratic process within India. In 2018, a group of foreign nationals in Mumbai formed an organization to promote civic engagement and political participation among non-Indian citizens.

These are just a few examples of successful advocacy efforts by non-Indians for their rights within India. It is important to note that these efforts often face challenges and obstacles, including legal and bureaucratic bar
