Ensuring that the healthcare needs of individuals with extreme or hard-to-treat genetic conditions are met can be challenging, especially for those who are not covered by traditional health insurance. Here are some potential strategies for addressing this issue:

1. Advocacy and awareness: Raising awareness about the needs of individuals with extreme or hard-to-treat genetic conditions can help to build support and momentum for policies that address their healthcare needs. This can involve advocating for increased funding for genetics research, as well as promoting greater understanding and empathy towards individuals with these conditions.
2. Public-private partnerships: Collaboration between public and private organizations can help to pool resources and expertise, enabling the development of new treatments and therapies for extreme or hard-to-treat genetic conditions. This can involve partnering with pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and other stakeholders to accelerate the discovery and development of new treatments.
3. Telemedicine and remote consultations: For individuals with extreme or hard-to-treat genetic conditions who live in remote areas or have mobility issues, telemedicine and remote consultations can provide access to healthcare services that might otherwise be unavailable. This can involve using video conferencing technology to connect patients with specialists and other healthcare providers.
4. Personalized medicine: By analyzing an individual's genetic makeup, healthcare providers can tailor treatments to their specific needs. This approach can be particularly effective for individuals with extreme or hard-to-treat genetic conditions, who may require more personalized and innovative treatment strategies.
5. Gene therapy: Gene therapy involves inserting a healthy copy of a missing or defective gene into a patient's cells to replace the faulty gene. This can be a promising approach for treating extreme or hard-to-treat genetic conditions, although it is still in its early stages of development and faces significant technical and ethical challenges.
