Promoting the educational success of bereaved gender-nonconforming students requires a supportive and inclusive environment that acknowledges and addresses their unique needs. Here are some strategies to help achieve this:

1. Create a safe space: Ensure that the school creates a safe and welcoming environment for gender-nonconforming students who have experienced loss. This can be achieved by providing private spaces for expressing emotions, displaying personal items, or engaging in activities that help them process their grief.
2. Use inclusive language: Adopt language policies that recognize and respect the gender identity of all students, including those who are gender-nonconforming. Encourage teachers and staff to use students' preferred names, pronouns, and identifiers.
3. Provide counseling services: Offer regular counseling sessions with trained mental health professionals who have experience working with gender-nonconforming students. These sessions can help students process their emotions, manage stress, and develop coping strategies.
4. Develop a support network: Encourage the formation of a support network among gender-nonconforming students. This can be done by creating a peer support group or connecting them with other students who have experienced similar losses.
5. Incorporate LGBTQ+ issues into curriculum: Include LGBTQ+ issues in the curriculum to help students understand and appreciate the diversity of gender identities. This can help reduce bullying and discrimination based on gender identity.
6. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations that respect students' gender identity, such as allowing them to use a different restroom or locker room than their gender assignment at birth.
7. Engage parents and families: Keep parents and families informed about their child's educational progress and involve them in the support process. This can help build a stronger support network for the student.
8. Foster inclusive teaching practices: Train teachers to recognize and challenge their own biases and stereotypes, and provide them with strategies to create an inclusive learning environment for all students, including gender-nonconforming ones.
9. Offer extracurricular activities: Encourage participation in extracurricular activities that promote self-expression and creativity, such as art, drama, or music programs
