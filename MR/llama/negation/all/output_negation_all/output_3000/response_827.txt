Creating more inclusive social policies for not divorced multiple times permanent residents (NDMRs) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this group. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge the stigma: The first step is to acknowledge the stigma associated with being an NDMR. This can be done by recognizing the specific challenges and discrimination faced by this group and working to break down these barriers.
2. Define the term: Develop a clear definition of what it means to be an NDMR, including the criteria for inclusion in this category. This will help ensure that everyone who is eligible for support receives it.
3. Identify the needs: Conduct research to identify the specific needs and challenges faced by NDMRs. This can include areas such as housing, employment, education, healthcare, and social welfare.
4. Develop targeted policies: Based on the needs identified in step 3, develop targeted policies that address the unique challenges faced by NDMRs. These policies should be designed to provide support and inclusivity to this group.
5. Provide access to education and job training: Offer training and education programs specifically tailored to the needs of NDMRs, including vocational training, language classes, and other forms of support.
6. Address housing discrimination: Work to address housing discrimination faced by NDMRs by implementing policies that protect them from discrimination in the rental market and provide affordable housing options.
7. Promote social inclusion: Implement policies that promote social inclusion, such as cultural events, community programs, and other initiatives that bring people together and foster a sense of belonging.
8. Provide mental health support: Offer mental health support services specifically tailored to the needs of NDMRs, including counseling, therapy, and other forms of support.
9. Address health disparities: Work to address health disparities faced by NDMRs by implementing policies that improve access to healthcare services and address specific health issues affecting this group.
10. Monitor progress: Regularly monitor progress towards creating more inclusive social policies for NDMRs, using data and research to identify areas of improvement and adjust policies accordingly.
