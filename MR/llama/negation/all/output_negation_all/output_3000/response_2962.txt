Creating more inclusive social policies for deep poverty individuals who are newly not married and have been happy in their singleness for many years requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges these individuals face. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the value of singleness: Many social policies targeted at low-income individuals assume that marriage and family are the ultimate goals of society. However, not everyone desires or needs to be in a romantic relationship or have children. Policies should acknowledge and recognize the value of singleness and the unique challenges faced by this group.
2. Increase access to affordable housing: Many deep poverty individuals struggle with unaffordable housing costs, which can limit their ability to save money, access healthcare, and achieve financial stability. Policies should prioritize increasing access to affordable housing options, such as rent control, subsidized housing, or cooperative living arrangements.
3. Improve access to quality education and job training: Many newly not married individuals face barriers to accessing quality education and job training, which can limit their ability to compete in the job market. Policies should prioritize investing in educational programs that provide practical skills training and job placement services.
4. Address food insecurity: Deep poverty individuals may struggle with food insecurity due to limited access to healthy and affordable food options. Policies should prioritize increasing access to nutritious food through initiatives such as food banks, community gardens, or subsidized grocery programs.
5. Provide mental health support: Singleness can be a challenging experience, particularly for those facing poverty and social isolation. Policies should prioritize providing mental health support services, such as counseling and therapy, to help individuals cope with stress and anxiety.
6. Foster community connections: Many newly not married individuals face social isolation due to limited access to social networks. Policies should prioritize fostering community connections through initiatives such as volunteer opportunities, social events, or group outings.
7. Advocate for flexible work arrangements: Deep poverty individuals may face barriers to employment due to inflexible work schedules or lack of access to childcare. Polic
