Deep poverty, also known as extreme poverty, refers to the state of living on less than $1.90 per day. The challenges faced by individuals living in deep poverty can be numerous and varied, and are often interconnected. Here are some of the common challenges faced by people living in deep poverty in the job market:

1. Limited access to education and job skills: Many individuals living in deep poverty may not have access to quality education, which limits their job prospects and earning potential. They may also lack access to vocational training or other forms of skills development.
2. Limited job opportunities: In many areas, there may be a limited number of jobs available that pay a living wage. This can make it difficult for individuals to find employment, especially if they lack the necessary skills or experience.
3. Discrimination and bias: Individuals living in deep poverty may face discrimination and bias in the job market, which can limit their access to certain jobs or opportunities. This can be due to factors such as race, gender, age, or other aspects of their identity.
4. Lack of transportation: In many areas, individuals living in deep poverty may not have access to reliable transportation, which can make it difficult to get to job interviews or even get to work if they are able to find a job.
5. Limited access to resources and networks: Individuals living in deep poverty may lack access to resources such as computers, internet, or other tools that can help them search for jobs or network with potential employers. They may also lack connections to professional organizations or mentors who can help them advance their careers.

7. Childcare responsibilities: Many individuals living in deep poverty may have childcare responsibilities that limit their ability to work or advance in their careers. This can be particularly challenging if they lack access to affordable childcare options.
8. Limited job security: In many areas, jobs may be insecure and unstable, which can make it difficult for individuals living in deep poverty to plan for the future or even meet their basic needs.
