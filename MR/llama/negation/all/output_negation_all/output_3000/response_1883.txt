Promoting the inclusion of mixed non-Asian heritage individuals in professional athletics is important for several reasons:

1. Representation matters: Seeing individuals who look like them in leadership positions can inspire and motivate young people from underrepresented groups to pursue their dreams and reach their full potential.
2. Breaking stereotypes: Professional sports can be a powerful platform for challenging harmful stereotypes and promoting cultural understanding. By showcasing the talents of mixed non-Asian heritage individuals, we can challenge the notion that athletic success is limited to one race or ethnicity.
3. Diversifying opportunities: Increasing diversity in professional sports can lead to more equitable access to resources and opportunities for young athletes from underrepresented groups. This can help level the playing field and create a more inclusive environment.
4. Role models matter: Mixed non-Asian heritage individuals who excel in professional sports can serve as powerful role models for young people from diverse backgrounds. They can demonstrate that success is possible with hard work, determination, and perseverance, regardless of race or ethnicity.
5. Challenging systemic barriers: The lack of representation of mixed non-Asian heritage individuals in professional sports can be attributed to various systemic barriers, including discrimination, limited access to resources, and unconscious bias. By promoting inclusion, we can work towards dismantling these barriers and creating a more equitable environment for all athletes.

This can involve providing training on unconscious bias and cultural competency, as well as implementing policies that promote diversity and inclusion.
3. Develop talent identification programs: Develop talent identification programs that
