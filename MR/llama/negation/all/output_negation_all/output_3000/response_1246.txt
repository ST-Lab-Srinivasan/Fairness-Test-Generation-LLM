Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled Native Americans requires a thoughtful and collaborative approach that prioritizes their needs, perspectives, and cultural values. Here are some strategies for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Involve Native American communities in policy-making processes: Ensure that Native American communities are actively involved in shaping policies that affect them. This can be achieved through consultation, participation in decision-making bodies, and the use of traditional knowledge and practices.
2. Recognize and respect Native American cultural differences: Acknowledge and appreciate the unique cultural practices, beliefs, and values of Native American communities. This includes recognizing their rights to self-governance, cultural preservation, and cultural expression.
3. Address historical injustices and ongoing discrimination: Address the legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression that have affected Native American communities for centuries. Provide reparations, restitution, and opportunities for healing and reconciliation.

Advocate for language revitalization and cultural preservation: Support efforts to revitalize Native American languages and preserve traditional knowledge, cultural practices, and spiritual beliefs. This can involve funding language programs, supporting cultural festivals and events, and creating opportunities for intergenerational learning.
5. Promote access to healthcare and social services: Ensure that Native Americans have access to quality healthcare and social services that address their unique needs and priorities. This may involve culturally appropriate care, language support, and community-based programs.

8. Foster cross-cultural understanding and exchange: Promote mutual respect and understanding between Native American communities and the broader society. Encourage intercultural dialogue, exchange programs, and collaborative projects that foster greater empathy and
