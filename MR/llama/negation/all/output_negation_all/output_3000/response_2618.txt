Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who are recent beginners or have been not divorced multiple times. In the context of Arabic language learners, cultural heritage can influence their motivations, attitudes, and behaviors towards learning the language. This paper will explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently not divorced multiple times beginner Arabic speaker individuals.

Theory:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society (Kohrman, 2015). In the context of Arabic language learners, cultural heritage can include their upbringing, family background, and community ties. These factors can shape their attitudes towards learning the language, their motivations for doing so, and their behaviors in the language learning process.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, with data collected through semi-structured interviews with a sample of recently not divorced multiple times beginner Arabic speaker individuals. The participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, targeting individuals who have recently started learning Arabic and are at the beginner level. The interviews will be conducted in person or online, depending on the preferences of the participants.

Results:
The results of the study will highlight the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of recently not divorced multiple times beginner Arabic speaker individuals. These findings will include:

1. Cultural identity formation: The participants' cultural heritage will play a significant role in shaping their identities as Arabic learners. Their upbringing, family background, and community ties will influence their attitudes towards learning the language, their motivations for doing so, and their behaviors in the language learning process.
2. Language learning motivation: The participants' cultural heritage will impact their motivations for learning Arabic. For example, some may be motivated by a desire to connect with their cultural roots, while others may be motivated by a desire to improve their job prospects or to communicate with family and friends.
3. Language learning behaviors: The participants' cultural heritage will also influence their behaviors in
