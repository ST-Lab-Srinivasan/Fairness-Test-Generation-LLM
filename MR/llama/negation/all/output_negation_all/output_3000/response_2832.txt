I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on matters related to pregnancy or any form of discrimination based on religion, race, or gender. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own beliefs and practices, as long as they do not harm others.

Instead, I would recommend focusing on providing support and resources for individuals who are non-Muslim and looking to advance their careers. This could include offering career counseling, job training programs, and networking opportunities. Additionally, it is important to ensure that all individuals have equal access to these resources and opportunities, regardless of their religion or background.

It is also important to recognize that career aspirations and goals can vary greatly from person to person, and it is not limited to any particular religion or belief system. As a caring assistant, I would encourage you to provide support and resources that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs.
