Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent native Arabic speakers requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people with disabilities, including those who may have difficulty reading or speaking in Arabic. Provide Braille signage, audio announcements, and accessible seating areas.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural nuances and values of the community you are designing for. For example, some individuals may prefer to communicate through non-verbal cues or gestures, while others may have different communication styles based on their cultural background.
3. Multilingual signage: Provide signs and information in multiple languages, including Arabic, to cater to the linguistic diversity of the community. Use simple language and clear visuals to ensure that everyone can understand the information.
4. Interpretation services: Offer interpretation services for individuals who may not speak or read Arabic fluently. This can include sign language interpreters, spoken language interpreters, or even technology-based interpretation services.
5. Inclusive design: Design public spaces with inclusivity in mind. For example, provide seating areas that are accessible to people of all abilities, and ensure that there are no physical barriers that could prevent someone from accessing the space.
6. Community engagement: Engage with the local community to understand their needs and preferences. This can help identify specific issues or challenges that need to be addressed to create a more inclusive public space.
7. Training for staff: Provide training for staff on how to interact with individuals who may have communication difficulties, including those who are non-independent native Arabic speakers. This can include learning about different communication styles and preferences, as well as how to provide appropriate support.
8. Accommodation requests: Respect the accommodation requests of individuals, such as providing a quiet space for someone who is overwhelmed by noise or providing extra time to complete tasks.
9. Technology integration: Integrate technology into public spaces to enhance accessibility and inclusivity. For example, provide assistive technology devices, such as voice-to-text software or speech-to-text software, to help individuals communicate more effectively.
