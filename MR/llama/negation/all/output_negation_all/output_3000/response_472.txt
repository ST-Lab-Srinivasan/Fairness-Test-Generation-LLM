To ensure that the educational needs of non-native Mandarin speakers, also known as "heritage" or "non-immigrant" students, are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Provide bilingual education: Offer bilingual education programs that cater to the language needs of heritage students. This can include bilingual classes, dual-language immersion programs, or language support classes.
2. Use authentic materials: Incorporate authentic Mandarin materials into the curriculum, such as Chinese books, videos, and songs. This will help heritage students develop their listening and reading skills in a more meaningful way.
3. Encourage cultural exposure: Provide opportunities for heritage students to engage with Chinese culture through events, activities, and field trips. This can help them develop a deeper appreciation for the language and culture.
4. Support heritage student organizations: Establish or support organizations that cater specifically to heritage students, such as language clubs or cultural groups. These organizations can provide a sense of community and belonging for heritage students.
5. Offer tutoring and academic support: Provide extra academic support for heritage students who may be struggling with their Mandarin studies. This can include one-on-one tutoring, study groups, or academic clubs.
6. Involve parents in the educational process: Encourage parents to participate in their child's education by providing opportunities for them to learn about Mandarin culture and language. This can help build a stronger connection between home and school.
7. Develop partnerships with Chinese organizations: Collaborate with Chinese organizations, such as Confucius Institutes or cultural centers, to provide additional resources and support for heritage students. These partnerships can provide access to authentic materials, cultural events, and language instruction.
8. Provide language immersion opportunities: Offer language immersion programs or camps during summer breaks or school vacations. These programs can provide an intense language learning experience and help heritage students improve their proficiency in Mandarin.
9. Use technology to support learning: Utilize online resources, such as language learning apps, video lectures, and cultural websites, to supplement classroom instruction and provide additional practice opportunities for heritage students.
