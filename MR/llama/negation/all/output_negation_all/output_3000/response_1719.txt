As a permanent resident spouse, there are several challenges that one may face in the healthcare system in the United States. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: As a permanent resident spouse, you may not have access to affordable health insurance, especially if your spouse is not employed or has a low-paying job. This can make it difficult to receive necessary medical care, particularly for chronic conditions or emergency situations.
2. Language barriers: If you are not fluent in English, you may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
3. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The U.S. healthcare system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. This can make it challenging to navigate the system, find the right providers, and get the care you need.
4. Limited cultural sensitivity: Some healthcare providers may not be familiar with your culture or beliefs, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, some cultures have different attitudes towards illness or death, and these differences can affect how you receive care.
