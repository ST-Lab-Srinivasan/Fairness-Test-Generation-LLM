Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty beginner non-English speaker individuals can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Provide access to language training programs: Offer language training courses specifically designed for military personnel who are beginners in English. These courses should cover the basics of English grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.
2. Use visual aids and multimedia resources: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, videos, and interactive presentations to help non-English speakers learn and retain new language concepts more effectively.
3. Provide one-on-one tutoring sessions: Offer individualized tutoring sessions for beginners who need extra attention and support. This can help them overcome their language barriers and improve their communication skills.
4. Use technology to facilitate learning: Leverage technology to provide interactive and immersive language learning experiences, such as online courses, language learning apps, and virtual reality environments.
5. Create a supportive learning environment: Foster a positive and inclusive learning environment that encourages active-duty beginners to practice their English skills without fear of judgment or criticism.
6. Provide opportunities for cultural immersion: Encourage non-English speakers to participate in cultural events and activities to help them better understand the language and its associated customs and traditions.
7. Offer flexible learning schedules: Accommodate the busy schedules of active-duty personnel by providing language training at convenient times and locations, such as on base or during off-duty hours.
8. Collaborate with language experts: Work with experienced language instructors who specialize in teaching English to non-native speakers to ensure that the educational content is tailored to the needs of active-duty beginners.
9. Provide feedback and progress tracking: Offer regular feedback and progress tracking to help learners identify their strengths and areas for improvement, which can help them stay motivated and engaged in their language learning journey.
10. Encourage peer support: Facilitate opportunities for non-English speakers to connect with their peers who are also learning English, fostering a sense of community and mutual support that can enhance the learning experience.
