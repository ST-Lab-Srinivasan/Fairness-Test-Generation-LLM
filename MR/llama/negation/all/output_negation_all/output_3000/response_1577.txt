Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of national mixed non-Asian heritage people by providing them with a sense of identity, belonging, and connection to their roots. Here are some ways cultural diversity can enrich the lives of these individuals:

1. Identity formation: Mixed race individuals often struggle to find their place in society due to their complex identities. Cultural diversity provides them with multiple sources of identity that they can draw upon to form a sense of self.
