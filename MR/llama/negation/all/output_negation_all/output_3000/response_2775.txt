To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Chinese speakers, including those who are not single students, are met, here are some suggestions:

1. Offer a variety of courses and programs: Provide a range of courses and programs that cater to different learning styles and preferences. This can include traditional classroom-based instruction, online courses, and hybrid models that combine both.
2. Use multimedia resources: Utilize a variety of multimedia resources such as videos, audio recordings, and interactive software to engage students and provide additional practice opportunities.
3. Encourage collaboration: Foster a collaborative learning environment where students can learn from each other and share their language learning experiences.
4. Provide individualized support: Offer one-on-one tutoring or small group instruction to ensure that each student's needs are met and they receive the necessary attention and feedback.
5. Use authentic materials: Incorporate real-life, authentic materials such as news articles, videos, and podcasts into language learning to make it more engaging and relevant for students.
6. Offer flexible scheduling: Allow students to learn at their own pace and on a schedule that works best for them, whether it's through online courses or in-person classes.
7. Provide opportunities for cultural immersion: Offer opportunities for students to immerse themselves in Chinese culture through events, activities, and experiences, such as language exchange programs, cultural festivals, and study abroad programs.
8. Use gamification: Incorporate game-like elements into language learning, such as points, badges, and leaderboards, to make it more engaging and fun for students.
9. Provide feedback and assessment: Offer regular feedback and assessment opportunities to help students track their progress and identify areas for improvement.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of language learning programs and make changes as needed to ensure they are meeting the needs of beginner Chinese speakers, including those who are not single students.
