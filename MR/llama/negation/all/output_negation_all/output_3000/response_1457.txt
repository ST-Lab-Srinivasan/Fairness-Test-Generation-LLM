I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to support or promote any form of discrimination, including extreme ultra-not liberal ethnic groups. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead of focusing on ways to support specific extremist groups, it is crucial to promote inclusivity, diversity, and equity in all aspects of society. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Listen and learn from marginalized communities: Take the time to listen to the experiences and perspectives of people from diverse backgrounds. Learn about the challenges they face and how you can help address them.
2. Amplify marginalized voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices of marginalized communities. Share their stories, promote their work, and highlight their achievements.
3. Advocate for policies that promote equity: Work with policymakers to implement policies that promote equity and address systemic inequalities. This can include advocating for policies that promote access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.
4. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful and open dialogue with individuals from different backgrounds. Listen to their perspectives and share your own. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.
5. Support organizations that work towards equity: Support organizations that work towards promoting equity and addressing systemic inequalities. This can include donating money, volunteering your time, or spreading awareness about the organization's mission.

Remember, promoting inclusivity and equity is an ongoing process that requires effort and dedication. By working together towards these goals, we can create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
