As a career coach, I have worked with numerous clients who are not widows or reservists but have faced significant challenges in the job market due to various reasons. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Ageism: Many clients experience ageism in the job market, particularly if they have taken a career break for an extended period. Employers may assume that older workers will not be as energetic or tech-savvy as their younger counterparts, leading to biases during the hiring process.
2. Skills gap: Clients who have been out of the job market for a long time may find it challenging to keep up with the latest industry trends, technologies, and work practices. This can lead to a perceived lack of skills or knowledge, making it difficult to secure interviews or job offers.
