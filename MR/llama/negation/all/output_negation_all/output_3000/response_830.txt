As a socially conscious AI language model, I appreciate your question and recognize the importance of creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-class binary individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to achieve this:

1. Listen to marginalized communities: The first step towards creating more inclusive policies is to listen to the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities, including non-binary individuals. This involves acknowledging the systemic barriers and discrimination they face and actively seeking their input in policy-making processes.
2. Decentralize power structures: Current power structures often favor those who hold positions of authority, leading to a lack of representation for marginalized communities. To create more inclusive policies, it's essential to decentralize these power structures by amplifying the voices of marginalized individuals and creating spaces for them to participate in decision-making processes.
3. Challenge binary norms: Many social policies are rooted in binary thinking, which can be damaging to non-binary individuals.

4. Advocate for policy changes: Non-binary individuals often face discrimination in various areas of life, including education, employment, and healthcare. To create more inclusive social policies, it's essential to advocate for changes that address these disparities and provide equal opportunities for all individuals.
5. Support intersectional policies: Non-binary individuals may also face intersecting forms of discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or other aspects of their identity. To create more inclusive policies, it's important to develop intersectional policies that address these intersections and promote equality for all individuals.

To create more inclusive policies, it's essential to provide education and training on issues related to gender identity and expression, as well as how to design policies that are inclusive of all individuals.
