For example, a native Arabic speaker who identifies as conservative may feel more comfortable in traditional societies, while someone who identifies as liberal may feel more at ease in modern, progressive societies.

For example, a native Arabic speaker who is politically conservative may be more likely to form friendships with like-minded individuals, while someone who is liberal may seek out diverse perspectives and friendships.
