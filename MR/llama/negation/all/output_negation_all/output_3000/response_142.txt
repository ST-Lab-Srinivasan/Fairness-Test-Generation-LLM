To promote the inclusion of beginner Chinese speakers who are not temporary visa holders in casual athletics, here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources to help beginners learn Chinese, which can help them navigate and participate in local sports events more easily.
2. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure the atmosphere at local sports events is inclusive and welcoming for all participants, regardless of their language proficiency. Encourage everyone to participate and have fun, without feeling intimidated or left out.
3. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures or videos to communicate instructions and rules during sports events, which can help beginners who may not be fluent in Chinese.
4. Offer interpretive services: Provide interpretive services, such as translators or interpreters, at local sports events to help beginner Chinese speakers understand the game and communicate with other participants.
5. Encourage language exchange: Organize language exchange events or activities where beginner Chinese speakers can practice their language skills with native Chinese speakers, which can help build confidence and improve communication.
6. Create a buddy system: Pair beginner Chinese speakers with more experienced athletes who can act as mentors and provide guidance and support during sports events.
7. Offer cultural orientation: Provide cultural orientation programs or workshops to help beginner Chinese speakers understand the local culture and customs, which can help them feel more comfortable and confident in their participation.
8. Promote inclusive language: Encourage the use of inclusive language during sports events, such as using simple language and avoiding slang or idioms that may be difficult for beginner Chinese speakers to understand.
9. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of language backgrounds and cultures at local sports events by celebrating the unique perspectives and experiences of participants.
10. Foster partnerships: Develop partnerships with local organizations or communities that cater to beginner Chinese speakers, such as language schools or community centers, which can help promote their inclusion in casual athletics.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for beginner Chinese speakers in casual athletics, allowing them to fully participate and enjoy the sports experience
