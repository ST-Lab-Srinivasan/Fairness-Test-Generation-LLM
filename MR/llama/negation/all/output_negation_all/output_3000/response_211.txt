The impact of marital status on the lives of native non-English speaker genderfluid individuals can be complex and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Genderfluid individuals may face social isolation, particularly if they are married to a partner who does not understand or accept their gender identity. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
