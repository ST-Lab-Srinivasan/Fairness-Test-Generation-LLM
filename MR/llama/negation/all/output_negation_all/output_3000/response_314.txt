Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent non-immigrant to Canada, ethnically full African people. As a result of historical and ongoing systemic racism, discrimination, and marginalization, many African individuals and communities in Canada face barriers to fully participating in Canadian society.
