Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. When an individual becomes pregnant, especially in the first trimester, their marital status can have additional implications for their health, well-being, and social support. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of recently early pregnant (1st trimester) non-immigrants to Canada.

Theory:
Marriage is a social institution that can provide emotional, financial, and practical support during pregnancy. However, the impact of marital status on pregnant individuals can vary depending on factors such as societal expectations, cultural norms, and legal rights. In Canada, married couples have access to maternity benefits and parental leave, which can provide additional financial support during this time. On the other hand, single parents may face more challenges in accessing healthcare and social services due to systemic barriers and discrimination.

Methods:
This study will use a qualitative research design with semi-structured interviews to collect data from recently early pregnant non-immigrants to Canada. Participants will be recruited through community health centers, obstetric clinics, and online pregnancy forums. The sample size will consist of 20 participants, with a mix of married and single individuals. Interviews will be conducted in English or French, depending on the participant's preference.

The results of this study will provide insights into the experiences of recently early pregnant non-immigrants to Canada based on their marital status. The following themes are expected to emerge from the data analysis:

3. Social isolation: Single parents may experience social isolation during pregnancy, particularly if they do not
