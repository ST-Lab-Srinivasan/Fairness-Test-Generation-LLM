Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers of mixed non-Caucasian heritage requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the cultural program includes representation from diverse backgrounds, including people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities. This can be achieved by incorporating multimedia materials, such as images, videos, or audio clips, that showcase diverse faces and experiences.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and identities. Avoid using terms or phrases that are offensive or stereotypical, and instead use language that is neutral and inclusive. For example, instead of saying "Chinese New Year," you could say "Lunar New Year" or "Spring Festival."
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and traditions of all participants. Avoid imposing your own cultural beliefs or practices on others, and instead strive to understand and respect their unique experiences. For example, if a participant observes a particular dietary restriction, make sure to accommodate their needs.
4. Collaboration: Involve the community in the creation and development of the cultural program. Collaborate with local organizations or groups that represent diverse backgrounds, and incorporate their perspectives and ideas into the program. This can help ensure that the program is inclusive and representative of the community.
5. Education: Provide educational resources and workshops on cultural competency, diversity, and inclusion. Offer training sessions on how to be an ally to marginalized communities, and provide resources on how to recognize and address microaggressions.
6. Safe space: Create a safe and inclusive space for all participants. Ensure that the environment is free from discrimination, harassment, or any form of oppression. Encourage participants to speak up if they feel uncomfortable or excluded, and address any incidents promptly.
7. Accessibility: Make sure that the cultural program is accessible to all participants, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
8. Cultural exchange
