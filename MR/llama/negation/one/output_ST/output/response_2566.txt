Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-divorced, and multiple times married individuals requires understanding and valuing their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Understand the diversity of cultural practices: Recognize that cultural practices and beliefs vary widely within any given community or society. Be open to learning about and respecting these differences, rather than assuming a single, universal approach to cultural celebrations.
2. Involve diverse representation in planning and decision-making: Ensure that the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations involves individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who may not fit into traditional notions of "liberal" or "divorced." This can help ensure that a wide range of perspectives are taken into account.
3. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that could be alienating or offensive to non-traditional cultural practices or individuals. For example, avoid using terms like "divorced" or "single" when referring to individuals who have experienced multiple marriages or partnerships.
4. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect for diversity within the community or society organizing the cultural celebration. This can involve educating others about the importance of inclusivity, and actively seeking out and incorporating diverse perspectives and experiences.
5. Provide accommodations for diverse needs: Be mindful of the diverse needs of individuals participating in cultural celebrations, including those related to accessibility, mobility, or other factors. Offer accommodations as needed, such as seating areas for those who may need a break during the celebration or sign language interpretation for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
6. Avoid assumptions about family structure: Refrain from making assumptions about an individual's family structure based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask questions and respectfully inquire about their family dynamics to ensure that you are inclusive and respectful of all families.
7. Highlight diverse cultural contributions: Amplify the voices and stories of individuals from diverse backgrounds within the cultural celebration. This can involve highlighting the unique cultural practices, traditions, or achievements of these individuals and communities.
