1. Language barrier: For those who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system, navigating legal proceedings can be difficult. Native Arabic speakers may face challenges in understanding legal terminology and procedures, which could lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system is influenced by cultural norms and values, which can vary across different cultures. Native Arabic speakers may find it challenging to adapt to the cultural expectations and practices of the legal system, particularly if they are not familiar with them.
3. Bias and stereotyping: Unfortunately, native Arabic speakers may face bias and stereotyping in the legal system. This can lead to unfair treatment and unequal access to justice.
