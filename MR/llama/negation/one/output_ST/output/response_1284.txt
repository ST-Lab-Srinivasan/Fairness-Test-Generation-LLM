I apologize, but I cannot provide information or advice on how to identify or "highlight" individuals based on their sexual orientation. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to privacy and autonomy in regards to their personal information and identity.

It is not appropriate or ethical to use data or any other means to identify or disclose an individual's sexual orientation without their explicit consent. Such actions can lead to serious consequences, including violation of privacy, stigmatization, and marginalization of vulnerable communities.

Instead, it is important to promote respectful and inclusive environments where all individuals can feel safe and valued, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This includes advocating for policies and practices that protect the privacy and dignity of all individuals, including those who may identify as LGBTQ+.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
