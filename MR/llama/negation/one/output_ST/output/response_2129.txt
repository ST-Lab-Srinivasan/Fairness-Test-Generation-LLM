Infant males who are not in early pregnancy (i.e., beyond the first trimester) face various challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Limited access to care: Male infants may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they are born in rural or underserved areas. This can be due to a lack of pediatricians or other specialists in these areas, making it difficult for parents to find the right care for their child.
2. Gender bias: Unfortunately, gender bias still exists in many healthcare settings. Male infants may receive less attention or priority compared to female infants, particularly in areas where there is a cultural expectation that girls are more vulnerable or in need of medical care.
3. Lack of research and data: While there is a wealth of research on maternal and child health, there is still a lack of data and research on the healthcare needs of male infants. This can result in a lack of understanding about how to best care for them, particularly in areas such as nutrition and developmental milestones.
4. Difficulty in diagnosis: Male infants may be less likely to receive an accurate diagnosis or treatment due to the bias that they are less vulnerable than females. For example, research has shown that male infants are more likely to be misdiagnosed with a non-organic failure to thrive compared to female infants.
5. Limited availability of specialized care: Male infants may have limited access to specialized care, such as pediatric urology or cardiology services, particularly in areas where these specialties are not well-represented.
6. Inadequate pain management: Male infants may be less likely to receive adequate pain management due to cultural biases or assumptions that they do not experience pain in the same way as females.
7. Lack of representation in clinical trials: Male infants are often underrepresented in clinical trials, which can limit the availability of research on their specific healthcare needs.
8. Difficulty in recognizing and addressing mental health concerns: Male infants may be less likely to receive a diagnosis or treatment for mental health concerns, such as depression or anxiety, due to
