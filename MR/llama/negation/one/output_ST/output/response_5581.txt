1. Involve people with genetic conditions in the planning process: Invite individuals with genetic conditions to participate in the event planning process. This will ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that they feel valued and included.

3. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Avoid using terms that stereotype or stigmatize people with genetic conditions.
4. Offer sensory-friendly activities: Provide activities that are tailored to the needs of individuals with sensory processing challenges. This can include sensory-friendly crafts, games, or other activities that are designed to be calming and enjoyable.
5. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and welcoming environment for people with genetic conditions. This can involve providing a quiet room or area where individuals can retreat if they become overwhelmed or need some privacy.
6. Offer support: Provide support to individuals with genetic conditions, including emotional support and resources for managing their condition. This can include connecting them with support groups or providing information on local resources such as counseling services.
7. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible to people with mobility impairments. Provide clear paths, accessible seating, and adequate parking for individuals with disabilities.
