Moderate conservative native Arabic speakers may face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system (usually English), navigating legal procedures and documents can be daunting. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and delays in resolving issues.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system often operates under different cultural assumptions and values than those held by moderate conservative native Arabic speakers.
