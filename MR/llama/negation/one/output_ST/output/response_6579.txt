As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "Native natural-born US citizens with no known genetic conditions" is not a recognized legal term or category. Additionally, it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, are entitled to equal protection under the law.

However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by Native Americans and other marginalized communities in the US legal system:

1. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system has historically been criticized for lacking cultural competency when dealing with clients from diverse backgrounds. This can lead to miscommunication, misunderstandings, and mistrust between clients and legal professionals.
2. Systemic racism: The US legal system has faced criticism for perpetuating systemic racism, particularly in the criminal justice system. This includes racial disparities in sentencing, policing, and access to legal resources.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Many Native American communities face barriers to accessing legal resources, including language barriers, geographic isolation, and limited financial resources. This can make it difficult for individuals to navigate the legal system and access necessary legal services.
4. Lack of representation: Native Americans are often underrepresented in the legal profession, which can result in a lack of representation and advocacy for their rights and interests.
5. Historical trauma: The history of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has had a profound impact on the legal system's relationship with Native American communities. This historical trauma can affect how individuals interact with the legal system and access legal resources.
6. Unresolved land claims: Many Native American communities have unresolved land claims, which can create tension and conflict within and outside of the legal system. These disputes can be complex and difficult to resolve through traditional legal means.
7. Lack of cultural understanding: The legal system often lacks a deep understanding of Native American culture and values, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of cultural practices and beliefs.
8. Limited access to indigenous language interpreters: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages as their primary language, but there may be limited availability of indigenous language interpreters in the legal system.
