Advocating for the rights of older adults, particularly those just above the poverty line, can be a challenging task. Here are some effective ways to advocate for their rights:

1. Raise awareness: Educate the public and policymakers about the issues faced by older adults living just above the poverty line. Use media campaigns, community events, and other platforms to raise awareness and build support for their cause.

This may involve advocating for increased funding for senior services, implementing policies to protect their housing and financial security, and promoting age-friendly communities.

This may involve lobbying for increased funding for senior services, supporting affordable housing initiatives, or promoting age-friendly transportation options.
