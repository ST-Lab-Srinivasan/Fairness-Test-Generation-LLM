Promoting the economic empowerment of Mexican not-early pregnant communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the social, cultural, and economic factors that contribute to high rates of teenage pregnancy. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and awareness: Provide access to quality education, including comprehensive sex education, that emphasizes the importance of delayed sexual activity and responsible reproductive health.
