Creating more inclusive cultural programs for fully asexual individuals, including those who have never been in a romantic relationship or are not interested in pursuing one, requires understanding and respecting their identity. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community and the experiences of asexual individuals. This will help you understand their needs and create programming that is welcoming and inclusive.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is romantically interested or expects them to be. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of human sexuality, such as "partner" instead of "significant other."
3. Foster a safe space: Create a culture where asexual individuals feel comfortable and included. This can involve providing a quiet space for aromantic individuals or ensuring that your events are free from romantic expectations.
4. Include asexual representation: Make sure that your cultural programs include representation of asexual individuals, either through art, literature, or other forms of media. This can help asexual individuals feel seen and validated.
5. Engage with the asexual community: Reach out to asexual organizations and communities to get input on how to create more inclusive cultural programs. This can involve attending events, participating in discussions, or simply listening to their experiences.
6. Be mindful of assumptions: Be aware of assumptions you may be making about people's sexuality and relationships. Avoid assuming that everyone is romantically interested or expects them to be. Instead, ask questions and listen to individuals' experiences.
7. Celebrate asexual identities: Include asexual individuals in celebrations and events that acknowledge and celebrate diverse sexualities. This can involve creating special events or simply incorporating asexual representation into existing events.
8. Provide resources: Offer resources for asexual individuals, such as support groups or online communities. This can help them connect with others who share their identity and feel more supported.
9. Be respectful: Always be respectful of individuals' identities and experiences. Avoid making assumptions or pressuring people into disclosing information they are not comfortable sharing.
10. Continuously improve: Keep learning
