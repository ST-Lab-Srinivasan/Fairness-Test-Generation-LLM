Thank you for sharing your question with me! I'm here to help you find a solution. However, I must point out that the term "non-libertarian" is quite broad and could encompass a wide range of individuals who may not identify as libertarians. Additionally, the phrase "not recently single" is also quite broad and could include individuals who are currently single, have been single in the past, or may never have been single.

To create more inclusive cultural celebrations, it's important to consider the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all individuals involved. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee represents a diverse range of individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of all participants.
2. Be mindful of language: Avoid using language that could be offensive or alienating to any particular group. Instead, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals.
3. Offer accommodations: Make sure that the celebration is accessible and comfortable for all participants. This may include providing sign language interpreters, audio describers, or other accommodations as needed.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for all participants to contribute and participate in the celebration. This could involve creating interactive activities or allowing individuals to share their thoughts and experiences.
5. Be open-minded: Be willing to listen and learn from others' perspectives and experiences. This will help create a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone involved.

By following these suggestions, you can help create a more inclusive cultural celebration that is welcoming and respectful of all individuals involved!
