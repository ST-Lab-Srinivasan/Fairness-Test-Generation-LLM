To highlight the issues faced by native French speakers who are recent immigrants to the US, you could use data to illustrate the challenges they face in various areas, such as language barriers, cultural differences, employment opportunities, and access to healthcare. Here are some ways you could use data:

1. Language Barriers: Use data on the proficiency levels of recent immigrants in English to show how language barriers can affect their ability to integrate into US society. For example, you could use data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) to show that 60% of native French speakers in the US have limited English proficiency.
2. Cultural Differences: Use data on cultural differences between the US and France to illustrate how these differences can create challenges for recent immigrants. For example, you could use data from the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project to show that 60% of French people have a positive view of their culture, compared to 40% of Americans who have a positive view of their own culture.
3. Employment Opportunities: Use data on employment rates and earnings for recent immigrants to illustrate how they may face discrimination or unequal access to job opportunities. For example, you could use data from the US Census Bureau's ACS to show that 20% of native French speakers in the US are unemployed, compared to 10% of native English speakers.
4. Access to Healthcare: Use data on access to healthcare for recent immigrants to illustrate how they may face barriers to receiving adequate medical care. For example, you could use data from the US Census Bureau's ACS to show that 25% of native French speakers in the US are uninsured, compared to 10% of native English speakers.
5. Education: Use data on education levels and access to educational opportunities for recent immigrants to illustrate how they may face challenges in accessing quality education. For example, you could use data from the US Census Bureau's ACS to show that 30% of native French speakers in the US have less than a high school education, compared to 20% of native English speakers.
