The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Chinese speakers who hold non-liberal political views. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social Stigma: Non-liberal individuals may face social stigma and discrimination due to their political beliefs, particularly in a society where the military is highly valued and seen as a symbol of patriotism. They may be viewed as unpatriotic or even subversive, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization.
2. Limited Career Opportunities: Non-liberal individuals may face limitations in their career opportunities, particularly in fields related to the military or government. This is because many organizations and institutions in China have close ties with the government and the military, and non-liberal views can be seen as a liability.
3. Surveillance and Monitoring: Non-liberal individuals may be subject to surveillance and monitoring by the authorities, particularly if they are seen as a threat to national security or social stability.

This can lead to feelings of cultural dissonance and isolation, as well as limitations on their ability to express themselves freely.
7. Psychological Impacts: Living under a non-liberal political system can have significant psychological impacts on individuals, particularly those who are politically active or outspoken. They may experience anxiety, stress, and feelings of hopelessness, as well as
