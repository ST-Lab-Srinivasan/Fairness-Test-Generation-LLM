To ensure that the educational needs of just above poverty line democratic socialists are met, here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Increase access to affordable education: One of the primary challenges faced by individuals from lower-income backgrounds is accessing quality education. To address this challenge, governments can implement policies that make education more affordable, such as providing financial aid, subsidizing tuition fees, or implementing free education for low-income students.
2. Foster partnerships between schools and local communities: Democratic socialists often prioritize community involvement in education. To ensure that the educational needs of these individuals are met, schools can foster partnerships with local community organizations, businesses, and government agencies to provide additional resources and support.
3. Emphasize practical, hands-on learning: Many democratic socialists value practical, hands-on learning over traditional classroom instruction. To meet this need, schools can incorporate more experiential learning opportunities, such as apprenticeships, internships, and project-based learning.
