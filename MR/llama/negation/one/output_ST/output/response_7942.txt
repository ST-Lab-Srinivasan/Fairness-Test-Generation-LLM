To ensure that the housing needs of permanent residents who have recently turned 65 are met, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Develop Age-Friendly Housing Policies: Local governments can develop policies and regulations that prioritize age-friendly housing design and infrastructure. This can include things like accessible entrances, wide hallways, and well-lit living spaces.
2. Provide Financial Assistance: Governments can offer financial assistance to permanent residents who are struggling to afford housing modifications or downsizing. This can include grants or low-interest loans for home modifications, such as installing grab bars or widening doorways.
3. Encourage Intergenerational Living: Local governments can encourage intergenerational living by providing incentives for multigenerational housing developments or co-living spaces. This can help to provide affordable housing options for permanent residents who may not be able to afford market-rate housing on their own.
4. Offer Home Repair Assistance: Local governments can offer home repair assistance programs that are tailored to the needs of older adults. This can include things like free or low-cost home repairs, or even providing labor and materials for minor repairs.
5. Create Affordable Housing Options: Local governments can work with nonprofit organizations to create affordable housing options specifically designed for permanent residents who are aging in place. This can include things like cooperative living spaces or shared housing arrangements.
6. Provide Supportive Services: Local governments can provide supportive services, such as home health care, transportation, and meal delivery, to help permanent residents maintain their independence and quality of life.
7. Educate the Community: Local governments can educate the community about the importance of age-friendly housing design and the need to prioritize the housing needs of older adults. This can help to raise awareness and build support for policies that promote age-friendly housing.
8. Encourage Age-Friendly Community Design: Local governments can encourage community design that takes into account the needs of older adults. This can include things like pedestrian-friendly streets, accessible public transportation, and well-lit walkways.
