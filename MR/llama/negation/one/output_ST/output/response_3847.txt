Creating more inclusive cultural programs for early pregnancy (1st trimester) mentally disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more accessible and enjoyable for this population:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural program is wheelchair-accessible and has a quiet room or space available for those who may need it. Offer assistive listening devices, such as headsets or earphones, for individuals who have difficulty hearing. Provide clear signage and navigation within the venue to help individuals with cognitive impairments navigate the space.
2. Modified activities: Develop activities that are tailored to the abilities of mentally disabled individuals. For example, instead of a traditional art class, provide a sensory-friendly art experience where participants can create art using different textures, colors, and smells. Offer adapted sports programs that incorporate physical activity while also promoting social interaction and communication.
3. Personalized support: Provide one-on-one support and guidance to help individuals with mentally disabled conditions participate in the cultural program. This can include providing additional support during activities or helping participants navigate the program's schedule and logistics.
4. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by minimizing distractions, using calming colors and lighting, and offering quiet spaces for individuals who may become overwhelmed. Offer fidget toys or other sensory aids to help individuals regulate their emotions and focus during the program.
5. Communication support: Provide communication supports such as visual aids, gestures, and pictures to help individuals with mentally disabled conditions communicate their needs and participate in the cultural program. Use plain language and avoid jargon or technical terms that may be difficult for participants to understand.
6. Involve participants in planning: Engage participants in the planning process by involving them in the creation of the cultural program. This can help ensure that the program is tailored to their interests and needs, and provides a sense of ownership and empowerment.
7. Build relationships: Foster positive relationships between participants and staff through consistent communication and personalized support. Encourage staff to get to know participants and their unique strengths, challenges, and preferences.
