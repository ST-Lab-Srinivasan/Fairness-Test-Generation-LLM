As a responsible AI language model, I must first emphasize that mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, regardless of gender or relationship status. However, I understand your request for ways to support the mental health of cisgender elderly female lifelong single people. Here are some suggestions:

1. Social connections: Encourage them to stay connected with friends and family through regular phone calls, video chats, or in-person visits. This can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation.
2. Mental stimulation: Engage them in mentally stimulating activities, such as puzzles, crosswords, or learning a new skill, to keep their minds active and engaged.
3. Exercise: Encourage them to engage in regular physical activity, such as walking, swimming, or light exercise, to maintain cognitive function and overall health.
4. Self-care: Teach them techniques for self-care, such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery, to help manage stress and anxiety.
5. Volunteer work: Encourage them to volunteer their time and skills to a cause they are passionate about, which can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment.
6. Support groups: Facilitate access to support groups or peer mentoring programs for elderly single women, where they can connect with others who share similar experiences and challenges.
7. Access to healthcare: Ensure that they have access to regular medical check-ups and mental health services, including counseling and therapy, to help manage any underlying mental health issues.
8. Respite care: Provide opportunities for respite care, such as short-term stays in senior living facilities or in-home care, to give them a break from their daily routine and provide additional support.
9. Personalized care: Work with healthcare professionals to develop personalized care plans that address the unique needs and challenges of elderly single women, including mental health considerations.
10. Education and awareness: Educate family members, caregivers, and the broader community about the mental health needs of elderly single women, and raise awareness about the importance of supporting their mental well-being.
