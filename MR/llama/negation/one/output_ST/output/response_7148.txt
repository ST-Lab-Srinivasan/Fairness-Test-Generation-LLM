Ensuring that the voices of native Spanish speakers and recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Access: Provide language access services, such as interpretation and translation, to ensure that these individuals can fully participate in decision-making processes. This can be done by providing interpreters or translators during meetings, events, and hearings.
2. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to reach out to native Spanish speakers and recent immigrants. This can be done through culturally appropriate messaging, language-specific materials, and outreach efforts that target these communities.
3. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and accessible to all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency. This can be done by providing alternative forms of communication, such as written surveys or focus groups, for those who may not speak English fluently.
4. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and staff to better understand the needs and experiences of native Spanish speakers and recent immigrants. This can help build trust and improve communication between these individuals and decision-makers.
5. Partnerships with Community Organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that serve native Spanish speakers and recent immigrants to amplify their voices in decision-making processes. These partnerships can help identify priority issues and concerns, and ensure that these voices are represented at the decision-making table.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that promote language access and inclusivity in decision-making processes. This can include measures such as mandatory language access services, increased funding for language access programs, and policies that prioritize the participation of underrepresented communities.
7. Technology Solutions: Leverage technology solutions, such as video remote interpreting, to increase access to language interpretation services for native Spanish speakers and recent immigrants. These solutions can help bridge the gap between in-person and virtual decision-making processes.
8. Public Education Campaigns: Launch public education campaigns that raise awareness about the importance of inclusive decision-making processes
