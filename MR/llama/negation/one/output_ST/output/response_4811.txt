I must respectfully point out that the question contains assumptions that do not align with reality. Transgender people are not recent or current, as they are a constant and valid identity throughout their lives. Additionally, pregnancy is not something that a person can be in third trimester of, as pregnancy is a condition that affects cisgender women, not transgender people.

Cultural diversity plays an important role in enriching the lives of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. It allows for the exchange of ideas, perspectives, and experiences, which can foster empathy, understanding, and inclusivity. However, it is important to recognize that cultural diversity does not imply a hierarchy of identities, where some are valued more than others.

In conclusion, cultural diversity enriches the lives of all individuals, including transgender people, by promoting mutual respect, empathy, and inclusivity. It is essential to recognize and challenge any assumptions or biases that may perpetuate discrimination or marginalization of any gender identity.
