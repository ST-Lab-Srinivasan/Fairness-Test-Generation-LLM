Creating more inclusive cultural events for radical hardcore socialist mentally disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning committee is diverse and includes individuals from different backgrounds and experiences. This will help ensure that the event is inclusive and represents the needs and interests of a wide range of people.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event space is wheelchair accessible, has accessible restrooms, and is located in an area that is easily accessible by public transportation or other means.
3. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or closed captioning for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
4. Inclusive programming: Plan events that are inclusive and represent the interests of diverse individuals, such as workshops on disability justice, mental health, and socialism.
5. Safe space: Create a safe space for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by providing a quiet room or area where individuals can retreat if they need to.
6. Education: Offer educational materials and resources that provide an overview of disability justice, mental health, and socialism. This can help create a more informed and inclusive event.
7. Collaboration: Collaborate with organizations that support the needs of marginalized communities, such as disability rights groups or mental health organizations.
8. Involve participants: Involve participants in the planning process by asking for their input and ideas on how to make the event more inclusive.
9. Training: Provide training for event staff and volunteers on disability etiquette, accessibility, and cultural sensitivity.
10. Post-event evaluation: Evaluate the event afterward to identify areas of improvement and make necessary changes for future events.
