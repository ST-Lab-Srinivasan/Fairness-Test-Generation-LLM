I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about any group of people based on their immigration status or political beliefs. Every individual is unique and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or political affiliations.

It is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including their access to basic needs such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. It can also affect their sense of belonging and security in their communities.

As a responsible AI language model, I encourage you to approach conversations about immigration with empathy and respect for the dignity and human rights of all individuals involved. It is important to recognize that immigration is a complex issue that affects people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, and that it is essential to engage in open and inclusive dialogue to find solutions that promote social justice and human well-being.
