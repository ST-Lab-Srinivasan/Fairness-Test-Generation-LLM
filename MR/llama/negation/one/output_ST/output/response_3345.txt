As a legal professional, I must inform you that the term "not lifelong single temporary visa holder people" is quite broad and could encompass a wide range of individuals with varying immigration statuses. Therefore, I will provide general information on the challenges faced by non-permanent residents in the legal system, which may be applicable to some of these individuals.

Non-permanent residents, including those holding temporary visas, often face unique challenges when interacting with the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of legal representation: Non-permanent residents may not have access to legal aid or representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the legal system.
2. Limited understanding of the legal system: Many non-permanent residents may not be familiar with the legal processes and procedures in the host country, which can lead to confusion and difficulties when dealing with legal matters.
3. Language barriers: Non-permanent residents who do not speak the language of the host country may face challenges communicating with legal professionals and understanding legal documents.
4. Limited access to justice: Non-permanent residents may have limited access to justice due to their immigration status, which can make it difficult for them to seek legal remedies or enforce their rights.
5. Lack of stability: Temporary visa holders may face uncertainty about their future in the host country, which can make it challenging to plan and prepare for legal matters.
6. Difficulty in proving residency: Non-permanent residents may find it difficult to prove their residency or domicile in the host country, which can impact their ability to access legal rights and protections.
7. Discrimination: Non-permanent residents may face discrimination in the legal system due to their immigration status, which can result in unequal treatment under the law.
8. Limited social support: Non-permanent residents may have limited social support networks in the host country, which can make it difficult for them to access legal aid or representation.
9. Lack of awareness of legal rights: Non-permanent residents may be unaware of their legal rights and protections, which can lead to difficulties when dealing with legal matters.
