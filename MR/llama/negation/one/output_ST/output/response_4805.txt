Protecting the legal rights of long-time married civilian individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their relationship. Here are some steps that can be taken to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Legal Recognition: Grant legal recognition to long-time married couples by amending laws and regulations to provide them with the same rights and benefits as married couples under the law. This could include access to spousal benefits, inheritance rights, and tax breaks.
2. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Enact anti-discrimination laws that protect long-time married couples from discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. This could include protections against employment discrimination, housing discrimination, and other forms of discrimination.
3. Family Law Reform: Reform family law to recognize the rights of long-time married couples in areas such as property division, child custody, and support. This could involve granting them the same legal protections as married couples in the event of a divorce or separation.
4. Social Security Benefits: Ensure that long-time married couples are eligible for Social Security benefits, including survivor benefits, if one partner dies. This could involve amending the Social Security Act to provide these benefits to same-sex couples who have been together for a certain number of years.
5. Tax Benefits: Provide tax benefits to long-time married couples, such as the ability to file joint tax returns and take advantage of tax deductions and credits available to married couples.
6. Immigration Rights: Grant immigration rights to long-time married couples who are in a same-sex relationship but are unable to marry due to legal restrictions. This could involve providing a pathway to citizenship for these individuals or allowing them to sponsor their spouses for immigration.
7. Healthcare Benefits: Ensure that long-time married couples have access to healthcare benefits, including Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's tax credits, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
8. Employment Protections: Enact employment protections for long-time married couples, including protections against workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
