Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal Native Spanish speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that takes into account their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive public spaces:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for public space designers, managers, and staff to better understand the cultural practices and values of non-liberal Native Spanish speakers. This training can help them recognize and address potential barriers to inclusion.
2. Accessible Design: Ensure that public spaces are designed with accessibility in mind, including wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio signals for visually impaired individuals. This will help create a more inclusive environment for all users.
3. Language Support: Provide language support services such as interpreters or translation materials for non-liberal Native Spanish speakers who may not speak the dominant language of the public space. This can include Braille and large print materials, audio descriptions, and sign language interpretation.
4. Inclusive Programming: Develop programming that caters to the diverse needs and interests of non-liberal Native Spanish speakers. This can include cultural events, workshops, and classes that promote understanding and appreciation of their heritage and culture.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with local communities and involve them in the design and management of public spaces. This can help ensure that the space is responsive to their needs and reflects their cultural values.
6. Education and Awareness: Educate the broader community about the importance of inclusivity and diversity in public spaces. This can involve campaigns to raise awareness and promote understanding of the experiences and challenges faced by non-liberal Native Spanish speakers.
7. Collaborative Design Process: Involve non-liberal Native Spanish speakers in the design process through collaborative workshops and focus groups. This can help ensure that their perspectives and needs are taken into account and that the final design is more inclusive.
8. Adaptability: Build adaptable public spaces that can accommodate a range of cultural practices and traditions. For example, providing flexible seating arrangements or designated areas for cultural practices such as smudging or prayer.
