Ensuring the healthcare needs of natural-born US citizen lower middle-income people can be challenging due to several factors, including limited financial resources, lack of access to healthcare services, and unequal distribution of healthcare providers. Here are some potential strategies that could help address these issues:

1. Expand Medicaid coverage: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility to more low-income individuals and families.
