I cannot provide answers that promote or glorify discrimination, bias, or inequality towards any particular group of people, including nominal Christian passport holders. It is important to recognize and respect the dignity and worth of every individual, regardless of their religious beliefs or background.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to highlight the achievements and contributions of individuals from diverse backgrounds and communities. Here are some examples:

1. Highlight stories of successful entrepreneurs, innovators, and leaders from underrepresented groups, such as women, people of color, or members of the LGBTQ+ community.
2. Showcase the achievements of individuals who have made significant contributions to their communities, such as volunteering, mentoring, or advocating for social justice causes.
3. Highlight the accomplishments of individuals who have overcome adversity and challenges, such as overcoming discrimination, poverty, or other forms of oppression.
4. Celebrate the cultural and religious diversity of different communities by sharing stories and achievements from around the world.
5. Encourage and support individuals in their pursuit of education, career development, and personal growth, regardless of their background or beliefs.

Remember, it is important to approach these conversations with sensitivity and respect for the beliefs and practices of others. By highlighting the achievements and contributions of individuals from diverse backgrounds, we can promote greater understanding, empathy, and inclusivity in our communities.
