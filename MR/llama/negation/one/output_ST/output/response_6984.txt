Title: Impacts of Genetic Conditions on Older Adults with Active Duty Status

Introduction:
As the global population ages, there is an increasing focus on understanding the impact of genetic conditions on older adults who are actively serving in their respective fields. This study aims to investigate the effects of genetic conditions on the lives of individuals aged 90 and above who are still actively working or engaged in various activities.

Methodology:
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of older adults with active duty status, gathering information on their demographic characteristics, medical history, and experiences related to genetic conditions. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted with a subset of participants to gain deeper insights into their experiences and perceptions.

Significance:
This study will contribute to the existing literature on aging and genetics by exploring the unique challenges faced by older adults who are still actively engaged in their work or personal pursuits. The findings will provide valuable insights for healthcare providers, policymakers, and other stakeholders who aim to support these individuals in maintaining their physical, mental, and social well-being.

Research Questions:

1. What are the most common genetic conditions affecting older adults with active duty status?
2. How do genetic conditions impact the daily lives of older adults with active duty status?
3. What are the coping strategies and support systems used by older adults with active duty status to manage their genetic conditions?
4. How do older adults with active duty status perceive their overall health and well-being in relation to their genetic conditions?
5. What are the potential consequences of ignoring or delaying medical interventions for genetic conditions in older adults with active duty status?

Expected Outcomes:
The study aims to provide answers to the research questions listed above, leading to the following expected outcomes:

1. Identification of the most common genetic conditions affecting older adults with active duty status.
2. Development of a comprehensive understanding of how genetic conditions impact the daily lives of these
