I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racist or elitist attitudes towards any group of people. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

Instead of focusing on ways to "support the economic empowerment" of specific groups of people based on their race or wealth, it is important to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. This can involve advocating for policies that promote economic mobility and reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation, affordable education and healthcare, and anti-discrimination laws.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that wealth and privilege are not the only factors that determine a person's value or worth. Every individual has unique talents, skills, and experiences that can contribute to society in meaningful ways, regardless of their economic status. By valuing and respecting the diversity of all individuals, we can work towards a more just and equitable society for everyone.
