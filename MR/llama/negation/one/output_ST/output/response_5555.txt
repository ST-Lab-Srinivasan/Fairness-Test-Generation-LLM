Introduction:

As the global population ages, the prevalence of genetic conditions is increasing among older adults, including those from ethnic minority groups. In this report, we will focus on the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of ethnically full Asian elderly male people. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify and analyze the available data on this topic.

Prevalence of Genetic Conditions:

The prevalence of genetic conditions varies among different ethnic groups, with some conditions being more common in certain populations. For example, Asian populations are at higher risk for certain genetic disorders such as sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis due to their genetic background. According to a study published in the Journal of Medical Genetics, the prevalence of sickle cell anemia among Asian populations is significantly higher than in other ethnic groups.

Impact on Quality of Life:

Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the quality of life of elderly male individuals from ethnic minority groups. These conditions can lead to reduced physical functioning, increased disability, and decreased independence in daily activities. A study published in the Journal of Gerontology found that older adults with genetic conditions experienced more difficulties in performing daily tasks compared to those without such conditions.

Social Isolation:

Elderly male individuals from ethnic minority groups who have genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to stigma, discrimination, and lack of access to healthcare resources. A study published in the Journal of Community Health found that older adults with genetic conditions were more likely to experience social isolation and loneliness compared to those without such conditions.

Cognitive Decline:

Some genetic conditions can also lead to cognitive decline and dementia among elderly male individuals from ethnic minority groups. A study published in the Journal of Neurology found that older adults with certain genetic mutations were at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.

Access to Healthcare:

Elderly male individuals from ethnic minority groups may face barriers in accessing healthcare resources due to cultural and language barriers, lack of transportation, and limited availability of specialized
