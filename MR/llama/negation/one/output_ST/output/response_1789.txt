Genetic conditions can have significant impacts on the lives of children living in lower-middle-income countries. These impacts can be both direct and indirect, and can affect various aspects of a child's life, including their health, education, social relationships, and overall well-being. Some common impacts of genetic conditions on children in lower-middle-income countries include:

1. Health problems: Genetic conditions can lead to a range of health problems, such as chronic illnesses, disabilities, and developmental delays. These conditions can significantly impact a child's quality of life and may require frequent medical interventions, which can be challenging in lower-middle-income countries where access to healthcare may be limited.
2. Stigma and social isolation: Children with genetic conditions may face stigma and social isolation from their peers and communities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, low self-esteem, and depression, which can have long-term effects on their mental health and well-being.
3. Economic challenges: Genetic conditions can result in significant economic burdens for families, particularly those living in lower-middle-income countries. The costs of medical care, rehabilitation, and other support services can be prohibitively expensive, leading to financial strain and stress on families.

5. Limited access to education: Children with genetic conditions may face challenges in accessing education due to their health issues or the lack of support services available in schools. This can result in a lower quality of education and reduced opportunities for social mobility.
6. Social isolation and limited social support: In many lower-middle-income countries, there may be limited social support networks and resources available for families with children with genetic conditions. This can lead to social isolation and reduced access to information and resources that can help families cope with the challenges of raising a child with a genetic condition.
7. Limited availability of specialized services: In many lower-middle-income
