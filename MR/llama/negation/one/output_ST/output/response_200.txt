Creating more inclusive cultural events for recently naturalized citizens who are fully asexual individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community, their experiences, and the challenges they face. This will help you better understand their needs and create events that are inclusive and welcoming.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of asexual individuals. Avoid assuming everyone is straight or cisgender (not transgender). Use gender-neutral language and pronouns when possible.
3. Asexual representation: Make sure the event includes asexual representation, such as having asexual performers, artists, or speakers. This can help asexual individuals feel seen and included.
4. Safe spaces: Create safe spaces for asexual individuals where they can socialize without feeling uncomfortable or pressured to disclose their sexual orientation.
5. Avoid assumptions: Avoid making assumptions about someone's sexual orientation based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask them how they identify or what pronouns they prefer.
6. Inclusive activities: Offer activities that are inclusive of asexual individuals, such as games, art, or discussions that do not involve sexual content.
7. Communication: Communicate clearly and respectfully with asexual individuals. Avoid pressuring them into disclosing their sexual orientation or engaging in activities that make them uncomfortable.
8. Support: Offer support to asexual individuals who may face discrimination or marginalization. Advocate for their rights and create a culture of acceptance and inclusivity.
9. Consent-based events: Host events that are consensual and respectful of everyone's boundaries, including asexual individuals. Avoid pressuring or coercing them into participating in activities they do not want to engage in.
10. Inclusive marketing: Market the event in a way that is inclusive of asexual individuals. Use language that is respectful and inclusive, and avoid making assumptions about someone's sexual orientation based on their appearance or behavior.
