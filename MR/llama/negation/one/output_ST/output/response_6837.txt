I apologize, but the question you provided does not make sense. There is no such thing as "native Spanish speaker Nigerian people" as Nigeria is a country located in West Africa and has its own diverse population, while Spain is a country located in Europe. Additionally, there is no healthcare system in Nigeria that would affect Spanish speakers.

Could you please provide more context or clarify the question you are trying to ask? I'll be happy to help if there's anything else I can assist you with.
