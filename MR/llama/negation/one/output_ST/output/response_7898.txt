Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-conservative beginner Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these spaces more welcoming:

1. Provide pronunciation guides and language learning resources: Offer pronunciation guides and language learning resources specifically designed for beginners, including non-native speakers. This can help reduce anxiety and make it easier for individuals to learn and practice the language.
2. Use visual aids and gestures: Incorporate visual aids and gestures into your teaching methods to help beginners understand and remember key words and phrases. For example, you can use hand gestures or pictures to illustrate word meanings.
3. Create a comfortable and supportive environment: Ensure that the learning environment is comfortable and supportive for all individuals, regardless of their level of proficiency in Arabic. Encourage beginners to ask questions and seek help when needed without fear of judgment or embarrassment.
4. Offer cultural immersion opportunities: Provide opportunities for beginners to immerse themselves in Arabic culture through events, workshops, or cultural activities. This can help them develop a deeper understanding of the language and its cultural context.
5. Foster intercultural dialogue: Encourage intercultural dialogue between Arabic learners and native speakers. This can help promote mutual understanding and respect, as well as provide beginners with role models and mentors to learn from.
6. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. This can involve providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
7. Promote inclusive language policies: Develop and implement inclusive language policies that promote respectful communication and cultural sensitivity. Encourage staff and learners to use gender-neutral language and avoid offensive or derogatory terms.
8. Offer individualized support: Provide individualized support to beginners, including one-on-one tutoring or small group instruction. This can help tailor the learning experience to each individual's needs and abilities.
