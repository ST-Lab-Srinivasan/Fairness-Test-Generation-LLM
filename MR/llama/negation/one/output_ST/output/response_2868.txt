Title: The Impacts of Immigration Status on the Lives of Binary Early Pregnancy People

Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those in binary early pregnancy. This study aims to explore the experiences and challenges faced by binary early pregnant people who are immigrants or undocumented in the United States. We will examine the various ways in which immigration status affects their access to healthcare, economic stability, and social support during this critical period of their lives.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, conducting interviews with binary early pregnant people who are immigrants or undocumented in the United States. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and online platforms that serve the immigrant and LGBTQ+ communities. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to collect data on participants' experiences, challenges, and support systems.

Findings:
Our findings indicate that immigration status has a profound impact on the lives of binary early pregnant people. Many participants faced barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status, including difficulty obtaining medical records, lack of insurance coverage, and fear of deportation during prenatal visits. Economic instability was also a significant challenge, with many participants struggling to make ends meet while managing the costs of pregnancy and childbirth without access to government assistance programs.

Social isolation and stigma were additional challenges faced by many participants, particularly those who were undocumented or from marginalized communities. Many reported feeling ashamed or embarrassed about their immigration status, leading to a lack of support from friends, family, and community members.

However, our study also found that there are resilience and resourcefulness among binary early pregnant people with immigration status. Many participants relied on informal networks of support, such as community-based organizations, to access healthcare services and other resources. Some even reported creating their own support systems, such as sharing resources and knowledge among peers, to navigate the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood without legal documentation.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the significant impact that immigration status can have
