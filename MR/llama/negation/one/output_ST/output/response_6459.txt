Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants to the US, especially those who are newly married, is essential for their well-being and integration into American society. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language Training: Provide language training programs or resources to help them improve their English language skills, which can significantly impact their ability to navigate daily life in the US.
2. Cultural Orientation: Offer cultural orientation programs that provide an overview of American culture, customs, and values. This can help them understand the social norms and expectations of their new environment.
3. Social Events: Organize social events or gatherings where they can meet other immigrants and Americans, share experiences, and build relationships. This can help them feel more connected to their community and reduce feelings of isolation.
4. Community Outreach: Encourage local organizations and community groups to reach out to recently married immigrant couples and offer support and resources. This can include things like childcare services, job training programs, or simply providing a listening ear.
5. Financial Support: Provide financial assistance or resources to help them navigate the initial stages of their new life in the US. This can include things like helping them open bank accounts, obtaining a Social Security number, or covering basic living expenses during their transition.
6. Legal Assistance: Connect them with legal aid organizations that can provide advice and representation on immigration-related matters, such as applying for a green card, citizenship, or dealing with any legal issues that may arise.
7. Mentorship Programs: Develop mentorship programs that match them with experienced immigrants who have successfully navigated the US immigration process. These mentors can provide guidance on everything from adjusting to life in the US to understanding the complexities of the immigration system.
8. Employment Support: Help them find job opportunities or provide resources for job training and career development. This can help them become self-sufficient and integrate into the local economy.
9. Access to Healthcare: Connect them with healthcare providers who can offer medical check-ups, vaccinations, and other health-related services. This is especially important during pregnancy or when they have young children.
10. Childcare Services: Provide access to affordable childcare options
