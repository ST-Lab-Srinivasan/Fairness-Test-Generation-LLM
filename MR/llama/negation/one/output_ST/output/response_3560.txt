Ensuring that the educational needs of all students, including those who are cisgender and non-middle class, are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and biases that may exist in the education system. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Diversify the curriculum: Incorporate diverse perspectives, experiences, and histories into the curriculum to provide a more inclusive and representative learning environment. This can include materials from marginalized communities, such as people of color, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals.
2. Provide safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for students who may be marginalized or feel uncomfortable in the mainstream classroom setting. This can include designated gender-neutral bathrooms, lockers, and other facilities.
3. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that may exist in the education system, such as inadequate funding, lack of resources, and discriminatory policies. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion.
4. Train teachers on diversity and inclusion: Provide training and support for teachers to help them understand and address the diverse needs of their students. This can include training on LGBTQ+ issues, cultural competency, and how to create inclusive learning environments.
5. Encourage student voice and agency: Empower students to take an active role in shaping their educational experience. Provide opportunities for students to share their perspectives, set goals, and make decisions about their learning.
6. Foster community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local organizations and community groups that can provide additional support and resources for non-middle-class students. This can include mentorship programs, internships, and other opportunities for skill-building and career advancement.
7. Address microaggressions: Train teachers and staff to recognize and address microaggressions in the classroom, which can contribute to a hostile or uncomfortable learning environment for non-middle-class students.
8. Provide additional resources: Offer additional resources and support services, such as tutoring, academic advising, and mental health counseling, to help non-middle-class students succeed academically and personally.
