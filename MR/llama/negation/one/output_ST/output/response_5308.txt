There are several challenges that beginner Arabic speakers and beginner English speakers may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barriers: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. Legal terminology can be complex and difficult to understand, especially for those who are not proficient in the language used in the courtroom. Beginner Arabic speakers may struggle to follow court proceedings when the majority of the legal documents and terms are in English. Similarly, beginner English speakers may find it challenging to comprehend legal concepts and terminology when much of the legal system is based on Arabic.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the Middle East and North Africa is often rooted in Islamic law and local customs, which can be unfamiliar to non-Muslim foreigners. Beginner Arabic speakers may struggle to navigate these cultural differences, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications that could impact their legal rights and obligations.
3. Limited access to legal resources: In many countries in the region, there may be limited access to legal resources, such as law libraries or online databases. This can make it difficult for beginner Arabic speakers to research and prepare their cases, especially compared to those who have more access to legal resources.
4. Lack of trust and confidence: Beginner Arabic speakers may feel uncomfortable navigating the legal system, especially if they are not familiar with the language or cultural norms. This lack of trust and confidence can lead to delays or avoidance of legal proceedings, which could negatively impact their legal rights and interests.
5. Difficulty in finding legal representation: In some countries, there may be limited access to legal representation for non-Muslim foreigners. Beginner Arabic speakers may struggle to find lawyers who are familiar with both the local legal system and their specific legal needs.
6. Time constraints: The legal system in the Middle East and North Africa can move at a slower pace than in other parts of the world, which can be challenging for beginner Arabic speakers who are not used to this pace. They may feel rushed or pressured to make decisions or take action before they feel fully prepared.
7. Limited understanding of legal procedures: Beginner Arabic speakers may have limited knowledge
