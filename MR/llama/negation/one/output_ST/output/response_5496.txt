Lost spouse civilian people face a range of challenges in the job market, including:

1. Emotional struggles: The loss of a spouse can have a profound emotional impact on an individual, making it difficult to focus and be productive in a work environment.
2. Lack of experience or skills: If the lost spouse was the primary breadwinner, their absence may result in a significant loss of income and skills, making it harder for the surviving partner to maintain their job or find new employment.
3. Childcare responsibilities: Many lost spouses are also parents, which can add an extra layer of complexity to their job search. Finding reliable childcare arrangements while also trying to find a new job can be a significant challenge.
4. Financial strain: The loss of a spouse can lead to financial instability, particularly if the lost spouse was the primary breadwinner. This can make it harder for the surviving partner to find a new job or maintain their current one.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Surviving partners may face stigma and discrimination in the workplace due to their personal circumstances, which can make it harder for them to find employment or advance in their careers.
6. Difficulty adapting to new roles: Lost spouses may have taken on different roles within their relationship, such as managing household responsibilities or supporting their partner's career. Adapting to these new roles and responsibilities can be challenging without their partner by their side.
7. Lack of support: Surviving partners may not have access to the same level of support and resources as they did when they were part of a couple, such as mental health services or career counseling.
8. Difficulty navigating workplace culture: The loss of a spouse can disrupt an individual's sense of identity and belonging in the workplace, making it harder to navigate workplace culture and build new relationships with colleagues.
9. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the industry or location, there may be limited job opportunities for surviving partners, particularly if they are not skilled in a particular field or do not have access to job listings or networking opportunities.
10. Burnout and compassion fatigue:
