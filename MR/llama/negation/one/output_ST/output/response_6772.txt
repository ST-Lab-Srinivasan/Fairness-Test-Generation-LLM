Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deep in poverty but have experienced multiple marriages or relationships requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some suggestions for how policymakers can create more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the complexity of the issue: Policymakers must recognize that individuals who have experienced multiple marriages or relationships are not a monolithic group, but rather a diverse population with different experiences and needs.
2. Collect data and conduct research: To better understand the needs of this population, policymakers should collect data and conduct research on the experiences and outcomes of individuals who have been married or in relationships multiple times. This can help identify specific challenges and inform more targeted policies.
3. Focus on early intervention and prevention: Many of the challenges faced by individuals who have experienced multiple marriages or relationships may be preventable with early intervention and support. Policymakers should consider investing in programs that provide emotional support, financial literacy training, and relationship skills development for individuals at risk of entering into unstable or abusive relationships.
4. Provide access to affordable healthcare: Ensuring that individuals have access to affordable healthcare can help address the physical and mental health challenges that may be associated with multiple marriages or relationships. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for mental health services, including counseling and therapy, and providing financial support for low-income individuals to access care.
5. Support family-friendly policies: Many individuals who have experienced multiple marriages or relationships may be juggling multiple responsibilities, such as childcare and financial support. Policymakers should consider implementing policies that provide support for families, such as paid family leave, flexible work arrangements, and affordable childcare options.

This can include working to address discrimination and inequality, particularly against marginalized communities, and providing support for individuals who are experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity.
7. Foster community connections: Individuals who have experienced multiple marriages or relationships
