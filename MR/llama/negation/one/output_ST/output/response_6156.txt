As a native Arabic speaker and a US citizen, there may be several challenges that you could face in the legal system as a beginner. Here are some potential challenges to consider:

1. Language barrier: Depending on where you live, you may encounter a language barrier when interacting with legal professionals or accessing legal resources. Even if you have a basic understanding of Arabic, there may be terminology or concepts that are unfamiliar to you, making it harder to navigate the legal system.
