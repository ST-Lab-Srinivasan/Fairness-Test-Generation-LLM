Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deep poverty Nigerian people are met is a complex and multifaceted challenge. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: Many deep poverty Nigerians lack access to basic healthcare services due to financial constraints, geographical barriers, or lack of infrastructure.
