Creating more inclusive cultural programs for partly asexual newly married individuals involves understanding and respecting their unique identity and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities and expressions. Avoid using binary terms like "husband" or "wife," which may not accurately reflect the individual's identity. Instead, use terms like "partner" or "spouse."
2. Education and Training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on asexuality and how to create inclusive environments for asexual individuals. This can help them better understand and support asexual couples in their cultural programs.
3. Asexual Representation: Include representation of asexual individuals in cultural programs, such as including asexual characters in stories or plays, or showcasing asexual art or music. This can help create a sense of belonging and visibility for asexual individuals.
4. Consent and Respect: Ensure that all cultural programs involve consent and respect for asexual individuals' boundaries. Avoid pressuring or coercing them into participating in activities that make them uncomfortable.
5. Flexibility: Be flexible and accommodating when planning cultural programs for asexual newly married individuals. Recognize that their preferences and needs may differ from those of other couples, and be willing to adjust plans accordingly.
6. Communication: Encourage open and respectful communication with asexual couples about their preferences and needs regarding cultural programs. Listen to their concerns and work together to create inclusive and enjoyable experiences for all.
7. Involvement: Involve asexual individuals in the planning and decision-making process of cultural programs. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and their preferences are taken into account.
8. Celebration of Identity: Celebrate and respect the identity of asexual individuals in cultural programs. Avoid making assumptions about their sexuality or pressuring them to conform to societal expectations.
9. Education on Asexuality: Provide education and resources on asexuality for other couples, families, and communities. This can help promote understanding and acceptance of asexual individuals and their identities.
