Title: Impacts of Immigration Status on Lives of Recently Pregnant Not Widowed People in Third Trimester

Introduction:
Immigration status can significantly impact the lives of pregnant individuals, particularly those who are not widowed for a long time. The third trimester of pregnancy is a critical period during which the baby's development accelerates, and the mother's health becomes more vulnerable to complications. This paper aims to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant not widowed people in their third trimester.

Impact on Health:
Undocumented immigrants face numerous barriers when seeking medical care, including language barriers, lack of access to health insurance, and fear of deportation. These barriers can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can result in pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preterm labor. Moreover, undocumented immigrants may avoid seeking medical attention due to the fear of being reported to immigration authorities, leading to more severe health consequences for both the mother and the baby.

Impact on Emotional Well-being:
The stress of living in a foreign country, combined with the fear and uncertainty surrounding immigration status, can take a significant toll on the emotional well-being of pregnant individuals. The constant worry about being separated from their families, the lack of social support, and the feeling of isolation can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Impact on Social Relationships:
Immigration status can also affect the social relationships of pregnant individuals. Discrimination, stigma, and social exclusion can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can negatively impact mental health during this critical period of pregnancy. Moreover, the lack of access to support networks and community resources can exacerbate these challenges.

Impact on Pregnancy Outcomes:
Studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are more likely to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as low birth weight, premature birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) babies
