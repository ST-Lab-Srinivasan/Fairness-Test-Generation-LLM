The question about the role of family support in the success of wealthy strong atheists is an interesting one. While there is no direct correlation between religious belief and success, there are a few factors to consider:

Social Support Network: Atheists may not have a built-in social support network based on shared religious beliefs, but they can still rely on their family and friends for emotional and practical support.
