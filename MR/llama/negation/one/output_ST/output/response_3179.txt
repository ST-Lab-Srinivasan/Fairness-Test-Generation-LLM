The impact of political affiliation can vary significantly on the lives of non-disabled natural-born Indian citizen people, depending on the specific context and policies in place. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Political affiliations can influence access to healthcare services. For instance, if a particular party is in power and prioritizes healthcare, citizens of that political affiliation may have better access to medical facilities, treatments, and resources. Conversely, if another party is in power and prioritizes other areas, people with different political affiliations might face barriers in accessing quality healthcare.
2. Education: Political affiliations can affect the quality of education received by citizens. For example, if a party prioritizes education and invests in the sector, children from that political affiliation may have better access to quality schools, teachers, and resources. On the other hand, if another party is in power and invests more in other areas, educational opportunities might be limited for those with different political leanings.
3. Employment Opportunities: Political affiliations can impact job opportunities and career advancement. For instance, if a particular party is in power and prioritizes certain industries or sectors, people from that political affiliation may have an advantage when applying for jobs in those areas. Conversely, individuals with different political leanings might face more challenges in finding employment or advancing their careers.
4. Social Welfare: Political affiliations can influence social welfare policies and services. For example, if a party prioritizes social welfare and invests in programs such as health insurance, unemployment benefits, and housing support, citizens of that political affiliation might have better access to these services. On the other hand, individuals with different political leanings might face barriers in accessing these essential resources.
5. Economic Opportunities: Political affiliations can affect economic opportunities and development. For instance, if a party prioritizes economic growth and investment in specific industries, citizens of that political affiliation may benefit from increased investment and job creation. Conversely, individuals with different political leanings might face challenges in accessing these opportunities.
