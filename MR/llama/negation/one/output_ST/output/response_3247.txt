The impact of immigration status on the lives of employed independent people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal uncertainty: Employed independent individuals who are undocumented or have temporary legal status may experience constant fear and uncertainty about their future in the country, which can affect their mental health and overall well-being.
2. Limited job opportunities: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers to advancing in their careers due to their immigration status. They may be hesitant to apply for promotions or seek new job opportunities due to fear of being discovered and deported.
3. Wage stagnation: Research has shown that undocumented immigrants often face wage stagnation or even wage cuts compared to their U.S.-born counterparts. This can limit their ability to save money, invest in education or assets, or achieve financial stability.
4. Lack of access to benefits: Many employed independent immigrants are ineligible for certain benefits, such as unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, or social security. This can leave them vulnerable during times of economic downturn or medical emergencies.
5. Social isolation: Employed independent immigrants may experience social isolation due to language barriers, cultural differences, or discrimination. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their communities.
6. Health disparities: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. This can result in delayed or inadequate medical treatment, leading to poorer health outcomes.
7. Housing instability: Employed independent immigrants may struggle to find affordable and stable housing due to their immigration status. They may face discrimination from landlords or be at risk of eviction.
8. Limited access to education: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers to accessing higher education due to their immigration status. This can limit their opportunities for career advancement and social mobility.
9. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to significant psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
