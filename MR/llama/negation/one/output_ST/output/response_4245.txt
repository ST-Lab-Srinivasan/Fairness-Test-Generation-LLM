Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing high-quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including native Arabic speakers. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for long-time veteran people who are native Arabic speakers:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, it helps build trust and rapport with patients from diverse backgrounds. This is particularly important for long-time veteran patients who may have experienced discrimination or misunderstandings in the past.
