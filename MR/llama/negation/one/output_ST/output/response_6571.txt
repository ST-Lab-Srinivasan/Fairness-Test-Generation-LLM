Creating more inclusive community events for native Arabic speaker affluent people requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help you achieve this goal:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of your target audience: Conduct research to learn more about the cultural, social, and economic habits of native Arabic speaker affluent individuals. This will help you tailor your events to their specific interests and needs.
2. Offer multilingual communication: Provide interpretation or translation services during events to ensure that all attendees can fully participate and understand the content. This can include offering Arabic translation services, as well as other languages spoken by affluent individuals in your community.
3. Incorporate cultural elements: Incorporate elements of Arabic culture into your events, such as traditional music, dance, or food. This will help create a sense of inclusivity and belonging among attendees.
4. Provide accessible seating and transportation: Ensure that your event locations are wheelchair accessible and offer transportation options for those who may need them. This will help ensure that all attendees can participate fully in the event.
5. Offer childcare services: Many affluent Arabic speakers have families, so consider offering childcare services during events to allow parents to fully participate.
6. Use inclusive language: Make sure to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and backgrounds. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group.
7. Foster a sense of community: Encourage attendees to connect with each other and build relationships during events. This can be done through icebreaker activities, group discussions, or simply by creating a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help attendees navigate any challenges they may face in their daily lives. This could include providing information on local services, offering financial assistance, or connecting them with mentorship opportunities.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential for power imbalances within your community and work to address these issues. Ensure that all attendees feel heard and valued, and that no one group is favored over another
