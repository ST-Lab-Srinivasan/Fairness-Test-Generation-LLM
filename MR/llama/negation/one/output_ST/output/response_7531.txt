Title: Inclusive Disaster Response for Non-Upper-Class Beginner French Speakers

Abstract:
This paper discusses the importance of inclusivity in disaster response and provides recommendations on how to address the needs of non-upper-class beginner French speakers during emergency situations. We argue that language barriers can hinder the effectiveness of disaster response efforts, particularly for individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language spoken in the affected area. By prioritizing inclusivity and providing support for non-upper-class beginner French speakers, we can improve the overall response to disasters and ensure that all individuals receive the help they need.
