Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-native Chinese speakers, including beginners, is essential to ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy cultural events. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural programs for nominal Muslim beginner Chinese speakers:

1. Use simple language: Avoid using complex sentences or technical terms that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Instead, use simple language and provide clear explanations to help them follow along.
2. Provide visual aids: Visual aids such as images, videos, or props can help beginners understand cultural concepts better. For example, you could show pictures of traditional Chinese clothing or instruments to help them learn about the culture.
3. Use interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities into your programs to make them more engaging and inclusive. For example, you could have a group discussion or activity where participants can share their experiences and insights about the culture.
4. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of nominal Muslim beginners. Avoid imposing your own cultural values on them or making assumptions about their beliefs. Instead, ask them about their cultural practices and traditions to learn more about their background.
5. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for participants who may need them, such as translation services or extra time to complete tasks. This can help ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate and enjoy the program.
6. Foster an inclusive environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment by promoting respectful communication and avoiding language or behavior that could be offensive or alienating. Encourage participants to share their perspectives and ideas, and provide opportunities for them to connect with each other.
7. Provide cultural orientation: Offer a cultural orientation session before the program begins to help beginners understand the cultural context of the events they will be participating in. This can include information about cultural norms, customs, and traditions.
8. Use culturally responsive teaching methods: Use teaching methods that are culturally responsive and inclusive. For example, incorporate music, dance, or storytelling into your programs to help participants connect with the culture on a deeper level.
9. Encourage participation: Encourage all participants to participate in
