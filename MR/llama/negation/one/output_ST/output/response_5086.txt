Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower middle-income people in Nigeria are met is a complex and multi-faceted challenge. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to primary care: Lower middle-income people in Nigeria often face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, and limited availability of health facilities in their areas. Increasing the number of community health centers or primary care clinics in underserved areas could help improve access to basic health services.
