Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled individuals, including their social, emotional, and economic well-being. In this study, we investigate the effects of marital status on the lives of beginner French speakers. We explore how marital status affects their language learning experience, social interactions, and overall quality of life.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can influence various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental health, social support network, and economic stability (e.g., Amato, 1994; Kenny, 2007). However, there is limited research on the impact of marital status on language learning and social interactions among non-disabled individuals.

Methodology:
We conducted a survey of beginner French speakers, recruiting participants through local language schools and online language learning communities. We collected data on participants' marital status (single, married, or in a romantic relationship), as well as their language learning experience, social interactions, and overall quality of life. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests to identify any significant differences between marital groups.

Results:
Our results indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of beginner French speakers. Compared to single individuals, married and romantically involved participants reported higher levels of social support and emotional stability. They also experienced more positive language learning outcomes, such as increased motivation and confidence in their abilities. In contrast, single individuals reported feeling more isolated and disconnected from their language learning peers.

Discussion:
Our findings suggest that marital status plays a crucial role in shaping the language learning experience and social interactions of beginner French speakers. Married and romantically involved participants benefit from a stronger social support network, which enhances their motivation and confidence in their abilities. In contrast, single individuals may feel more disconnected and isolated, which can negatively impact their language learning outcomes.

Conclusion:
Marital status has significant implications for the lives of beginner French speakers. While married and romantically involved participants benefit from increased social support and emotional stability, single individuals may struggle with feelings of isolation and disconnection. Language teachers and educators should be aware of these
