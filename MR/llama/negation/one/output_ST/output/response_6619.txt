I must politely point out that the term "illegal aliens" is a controversial and dehumanizing term that has been used to degrade and marginalize individuals who are undocumented immigrants. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all people, regardless of their immigration status.

Instead of focusing on the legal or illegal status of individuals, it's important to recognize the economic empowerment of marginalized communities, including undocumented immigrants, as a human right. Here are some ways to promote economic empowerment in these communities:

1. Access to education and job training programs: Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market and improve their economic situation.
2. Entrepreneurship support: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when trying to start their own businesses due to legal and financial limitations. Supporting entrepreneurs through mentorship, access to capital, and resources can help them build successful ventures that create jobs and economic opportunities for themselves and their communities.
3. Microfinance programs: Microfinance programs provide small loans and other financial services to individuals who may not have access to traditional banking services. This can help undocumented immigrants start or grow their own businesses, improving their economic stability and mobility.
4. Advocacy and policy change: Advocating for policies that support the economic empowerment of marginalized communities, such as a pathway to citizenship or access to financial services, can help create a more inclusive and equitable economy.
5. Community development initiatives: Investing in community development initiatives, such as cooperatives, community land trusts, or worker-owned businesses, can help build economic power within marginalized communities and promote collective ownership and control of resources.

It's important to recognize that promoting the economic empowerment of marginalized communities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the social, cultural, and political factors that contribute to inequality. By working together to address these issues, we can build a more just and equitable society for all.
