Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Arabic speakers as Native natural-born US citizens requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Understand the diversity of Arabic speakers in the US: The first step is to recognize that there is a diverse population of Arabic speakers in the US, with different cultures, languages, and customs. Therefore, it's important to tailor programs that cater to the specific needs and preferences of each group.
2. Engage with the community: Reach out to local Arabic-speaking communities and engage with them to understand their cultural practices and traditions. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or community events where you can gather feedback and insights from community members.
3. Provide multilingual resources: Offer resources in Arabic and other languages spoken by the local community. This can include brochures, flyers, posters, and websites that provide information about cultural programs and events.
4. Host cultural events: Organize events that showcase Arabic culture, such as traditional music and dance performances, language classes, or cultural workshops. Make sure these events are inclusive and accessible to all members of the community.
5. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that cater to Arabic-speaking communities to co-host events or provide resources. This can help build relationships and trust within the community.
6. Provide language training: Offer language classes in Arabic for those who are interested in learning more about the language and culture. This can also help bridge cultural gaps and promote understanding between different communities.
7. Celebrate Arabic heritage: Organize events that celebrate Arabic heritage, such as Arabic food festivals or cultural exhibitions. These events can help promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
8. Create a diverse advisory board: Establish an advisory board made up of community members from different backgrounds to provide input and guidance on cultural programs and events. This can help ensure that the programs are inclusive and representative of the community's diversity.
9. Provide opportunities for youth involvement: Encourage young people from Arabic-speaking communities to participate in cultural programs and events
