As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their ethnicity or cultural background, should be treated with respect and dignity in any legal system. However, I understand your question and will provide some general insights based on my training data.

Beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Caucasian people may face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: As a tonal language, Chinese can be challenging for non-native speakers to learn and master. This could lead to difficulties in understanding legal terminology, procedures, and documents, which could result in misunderstandings or miscommunications.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique cultural context that may differ significantly from those in Western societies. Beginner Chinese speakers might find it challenging to navigate the legal system's cultural expectations, such as the use of indirect language and the importance of social relationships in decision-making.
3. Lack of familiarity with legal terminology: Beginner Chinese speakers may not be familiar with the specific legal terminology used in China, which could lead to confusion when interacting with legal professionals or navigating legal documents.
4. Limited access to resources: Depending on their location and circumstances, beginner Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, online databases, or legal aid services. This could make it more challenging for them to research and understand the law.
5. Stereotyping and bias: Unfortunately, there is a history of stereotyping and discrimination against Caucasian people in China, which can manifest in various ways within the legal system. Beginner Chinese speakers may face bias or prejudice from legal professionals or judges, which could affect their experiences with the law.
6. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: The Chinese legal system is known for its complexity and bureaucracy, which can be overwhelming for anyone, let alone beginner Chinese speakers. Navigating government agencies, filing documents, and understanding procedures can be a significant challenge for those who are not familiar with the language or culture.
7. Limited legal representation: Depending on their location and socio-economic status, beginner Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal representation or advice.
