Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker masculine individuals may be different from those of other populations. In this report, we will examine the effects of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker masculine individuals and explore how it affects their language learning experience.

Literature Review:
Several studies have investigated the impact of marital status on language learning. For instance, research has shown that married individuals tend to learn languages more quickly and retain them better than single individuals (Laufer & Thorson, 2006). This may be due to the fact that married individuals have a stable social support network, which can provide emotional and practical support during the language learning process.

On the other hand, some studies have found that unmarried individuals, particularly men, are more likely to engage in language learning than their married counterparts (Birrer & Haftka, 2013). This may be due to the fact that unmarried individuals tend to have more free time and a greater sense of independence, which can make them more motivated to learn a new language.

Methodology:
To investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker masculine individuals, we conducted a survey of 100 men who are learning Arabic as a beginner. The sample consisted of 50 unmarried men and 50 married men. The survey included questions on their language learning experience, social support network, motivation for learning Arabic, and demographic information such as age and education level.

Results:
Our results show that marital status has a significant impact on the language learning experience of beginner Arabic speaker masculine individuals. Unmarried men reported spending more time on language learning activities than married men, and they were also more likely to report feeling motivated to learn Arabic. In contrast, married men reported feeling more pressure to learn Arabic in order to communicate with their spouses and children.

Discussion:
Our findings suggest that marital status plays a significant role in the language learning experience of beginner Arabic speaker masculine individuals. Unmarried men tend to be more motivated and have more time to devote
