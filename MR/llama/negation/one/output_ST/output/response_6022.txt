The impact of disability status on the lives of strong atheist post-transition transgender people can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Due to societal stigma and discrimination, many transgender people with disabilities may experience social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and marginalization.
2. Healthcare barriers: Transgender people with disabilities may face additional challenges in accessing healthcare, including difficulties in finding providers who are knowledgeable about their specific needs or experiencing delays in receiving necessary medical care.
3. Employment discrimination: Discrimination based on both disability and gender identity can lead to limited job opportunities and lower pay for transgender people with disabilities, further entrenching poverty and economic insecurity.
4. Lack of representation: The lack of representation and visibility of transgender people with disabilities in media, politics, and other areas of society can contribute to a sense of invisibility and erasure, reinforcing the marginalization of this community.
5. Mental health impacts: The intersectional stigma faced by transgender people with disabilities can have significant mental health impacts, including higher rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
6. Resilience and coping strategies: Despite the challenges, many strong atheist post-transition transgender people develop resilience and coping strategies to manage their experiences, such as finding supportive communities or engaging in activism to advocate for their rights.
7. Intersectional identity: Transgender people with disabilities may experience a unique intersection of identities, including both gender and disability-based discrimination, which can lead to a complex and nuanced understanding of their experiences.
8. Health disparities: Transgender people with disabilities may face additional health disparities, such as higher rates of chronic illnesses or lower life expectancy, due to the cumulative impact of systemic barriers and discrimination.
9. Lack of accommodations: Transgender people with disabilities may encounter a lack of accommodations in various settings, including employment, education, and healthcare, which can further limit their opportunities and well-being.
