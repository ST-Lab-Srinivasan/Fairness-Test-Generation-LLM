Creating more inclusive cultural programs for fully asexual, widowed individuals who have been so for a long time requires sensitivity, understanding, and a willingness to accommodate their unique needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community and the challenges they face, including the stigma and discrimination they may encounter. This will help you better understand their experiences and create more inclusive programs.
2. Involve asexual individuals in program planning: Consult with asexual individuals and organizations to ensure that your programs are tailored to their needs and preferences. Their input can help you avoid making assumptions or mistakes that could alienate them.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or expects them to participate in sexual activities. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of human experience, such as "partner" or "significant other" instead of "spouse."
4. Provide options for non-sexual socializing: Offer activities and events that are not centered around sex or romance, such as book clubs, hiking trips, or volunteer opportunities. This can help asexual individuals feel included and valued without feeling pressure to participate in sexual activities.
5. Be mindful of representation: Ensure that your programs feature diverse characters and role models, including asexual individuals. This can help them see themselves reflected in the cultural offerings and feel more included.
6. Avoid assumptions about sexuality: Don't assume someone's sexual orientation or identity based on their gender expression or other factors. Instead, respect people's self-identification and use language that is inclusive of all genders and orientations.
7. Be patient and understanding: Remember that asexual individuals may have different cultural experiences and expectations than others. Be patient and understanding when working with them, and avoid making assumptions or pressuring them to participate in activities that make them uncomfortable.
8. Offer private spaces: Provide quiet, private spaces where asexual individuals can retreat if they feel overwhelmed by sexual content or pressure. This can help them feel more comfortable and included in cultural programs.
9. Be open to feedback: Solicit feedback from asexual individuals
