Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make the program more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Understand the community: It is essential to understand the needs, preferences, and cultural background of the target audience. Conduct research or surveys to gather information about their interests, learning styles, and cultural practices. This will help tailor the program to meet their unique requirements.
2. Use culturally relevant content: Incorporate Chinese language and culture elements that resonate with the African American community. For example, you could use music, art, or literature that is popular among this group. This will help them connect with the material and feel more invested in the learning process.
3. Provide cultural context: Offer explanations and examples of Chinese cultural practices, traditions, and customs that are relevant to the African American community. This will help them understand the cultural context of the language and make it more meaningful for their lives.
4. Use diverse teaching methods: Employ a variety of teaching methods to accommodate different learning styles. For instance, you could use interactive games, role-playing exercises, or group discussions to engage students and make the learning experience more enjoyable.
5. Foster an inclusive environment: Create a warm and welcoming atmosphere where students feel comfortable expressing themselves. Encourage mutual respect, open communication, and active participation from all learners.
6. Provide support and resources: Offer additional resources and support to help students overcome challenges they may face in the learning process. This could include language exchange programs, tutoring services, or cultural events that promote interaction and collaboration among students.
7. Celebrate diversity: Acknowledge and celebrate the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the students. Encourage them to share their cultural practices, traditions, and perspectives with the group, promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic power imbalances that exist between different racial and ethnic groups. Be aware of your own privilege and positionality as a teacher, and work to create a space where all students feel valued and respected.
