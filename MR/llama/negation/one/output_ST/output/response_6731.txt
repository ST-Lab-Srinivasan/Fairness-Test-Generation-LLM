Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative, non-newly married individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and avoid cultural appropriation.
2. Be mindful of language and terminology: Avoid using language that may be offensive or exclusionary. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their marital status or conservatism.
3. Offer alternative celebration options: Provide separate celebrations or events for non-conservative and non-newly married individuals to ensure they feel included and valued. For example, a "Cultural Celebration for All" event could be organized, where everyone can participate without feeling left out.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where everyone feels welcome and included. This can be done by promoting diversity and inclusivity through various means, such as storytelling, music, and art.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Offer workshops or seminars that educate people about the importance of cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. This could help create a more understanding and empathetic community.
6. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Engage older and younger individuals in conversations about culture and tradition, promoting mutual respect and understanding. This can help break down barriers and create a more inclusive atmosphere.
7. Provide accommodations for different needs: Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials to ensure that everyone can participate fully.
8. Celebrate diversity through performances: Incorporate diverse performances, music, and dance into the celebration, showcasing the richness of different cultures and traditions.
9. Create a safe space for expression: Establish a safe and welcoming environment where individuals can express themselves freely, without fear of judgment or exclusion.
10. Encourage participatory involvement: Involve participants in the planning process by soliciting feedback and suggestions, ensuring that their voices are heard and valued.
