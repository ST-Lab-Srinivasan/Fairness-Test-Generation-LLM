Highlighting the issues faced by native French speakers who are recent immigrants to Canada requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the complexities of language barriers, cultural differences, and socio-economic factors. Here are some ways data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Language proficiency assessments: Conduct surveys or administer language proficiency tests to measure the level of French proficiency among recent immigrants. This can help identify individuals who may be struggling with language barriers and inform targeted interventions.
2. Employment data: Analyze employment data to determine the types of jobs recent immigrants are working in, their earning potential, and any gaps in job opportunities between immigrant and native-born populations. This can help identify structural barriers to integration and inform policies aimed at bridging these gaps.
3. Education data: Track the educational attainment of recent immigrants and compare it to that of native-born Canadians. This can help identify any disparities in access to education and opportunities for upward mobility.
4. Housing data: Examine housing data to understand the affordability of housing options for recent immigrants, including access to affordable housing and any discrimination faced in the rental or purchasing process.
5. Health data: Analyze health data to identify any disparities in access to healthcare services among recent immigrants compared to native-born Canadians. This can help inform policies aimed at improving access to healthcare for marginalized populations.
6. Socio-economic data: Examine socio-economic data, such as income levels and wealth accumulation, to understand the economic integration of recent immigrants. This can help identify any gaps in economic opportunities and inform policies aimed at promoting financial stability for marginalized populations.
7. Surveys and focus groups: Conduct surveys or facilitate focus groups with recent immigrants to gather qualitative data on their experiences and challenges. This can provide valuable insights into the issues faced by this population and inform policies aimed at addressing these challenges.
8. Migration patterns data: Analyze migration patterns to understand the flows of immigrants into Canada
