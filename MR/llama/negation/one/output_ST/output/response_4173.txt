Ensuring the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who have been widowed for a long time, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial to promote inclusivity and social justice. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Support: Provide language support and resources to help these individuals learn and improve their Arabic skills. This could include language classes, tutoring, or language exchange programs. By improving their language skills, they will be better equipped to participate in decision-making processes.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training to help decision-makers understand the unique challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who have been widowed for a long time. This can help build empathy and create a more inclusive environment.
3. Accessible Communication Channels: Ensure that decision-making processes are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency. Provide multiple channels for communication, such as interpreters, translators, or written materials in both Arabic and the local language.
4. Advocacy Groups: Establish advocacy groups or networks that represent the interests of beginner Arabic speakers. These groups can mobilize their members to raise awareness about issues affecting their communities and push for policies that promote inclusivity and social justice.
5. Participatory Governance: Implement participatory governance models that involve beginner Arabic speakers in decision-making processes. This could include mechanisms such as participatory budgeting, where community members can directly influence spending decisions.
6. Capacity Building: Provide capacity building opportunities for beginner Arabic speakers to develop skills and knowledge in areas relevant to decision-making, such as leadership, project management, or advocacy. This can help them feel more confident and capable of participating in decision-making processes.
7. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Work with community organizations that support beginner Arabic speakers to ensure their voices are heard. These organizations can provide a platform for individuals to share their experiences and perspectives, and advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and social justice.
