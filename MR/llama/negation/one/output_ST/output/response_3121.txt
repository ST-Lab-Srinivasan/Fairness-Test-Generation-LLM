I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or recommendations on how to discriminate against any particular group of people, including those based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. Discriminating against or denying basic rights to any group of people is not only morally reprehensible, but it is also illegal in many countries.

Instead of focusing on ways to discriminate against certain groups, it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. This can involve addressing systemic inequalities and working to break down barriers that prevent marginalized communities from achieving their full potential.

In terms of meeting the housing needs of individuals with ethnic backgrounds, it is important to recognize that there are a variety of factors that can impact an individual's ability to access safe and affordable housing. These can include discrimination, lack of access to credit and financial resources, and systemic inequalities in the housing market.

To address these issues, it may be necessary to implement policies and programs that actively work to address these inequalities and ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive. This can involve things like increasing the availability of affordable housing options, providing financial assistance and support to marginalized communities, and working to address systemic discrimination in the housing market.

Ultimately, it is important to recognize that meeting the housing needs of individuals with ethnic backgrounds is not a zero-sum game, where the needs of one group must be met at the expense of another. Rather, it is about working towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.
