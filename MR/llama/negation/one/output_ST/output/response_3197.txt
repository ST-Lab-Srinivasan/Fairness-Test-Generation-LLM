As a soft libertarian, you may face certain challenges when navigating the legal system as a French speaker. Here are some potential issues you may encounter:

1. Language Barrier: Depending on where you are located, you may face difficulties communicating with legal professionals and understanding legal terminology due to the language barrier. This can make it harder for you to access legal resources and services, which could further complicate matters.
