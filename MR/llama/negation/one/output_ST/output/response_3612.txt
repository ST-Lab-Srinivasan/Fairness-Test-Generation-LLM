Supporting the civic engagement of progressive Native recent immigrants to the US can be done through various means. Here are some strategies that organizations and individuals can employ:

1. Voter Registration and Education: Many Native American communities have historically faced barriers to voting, such as lack of access to polling stations or discrimination at the ballot box. Organizations can work to register Native Americans to vote, provide information on voting rights and procedures, and encourage civic participation in local elections.
2. Advocacy and Policy Change: Progressive Native recent immigrants may face unique challenges related to policy changes that affect their communities. Organizations can advocate for policies that promote the well-being of these communities, such as language preservation, cultural heritage protection, and access to healthcare.
3. Community Building and Capacity Building: Building strong, inclusive communities is essential for civic engagement. Organizations can provide capacity-building programs for Native American communities, focusing on leadership development, community organizing, and social entrepreneurship.
4. Cultural Preservation and Revitalization: Many Native American communities are working to preserve their cultural heritage and languages. Organizations can support these efforts by providing resources for language revitalization, cultural education, and intergenerational knowledge transfer.
5. Media Literacy and Storytelling: The media has a significant impact on shaping public opinion and influencing policy. Organizations can work with Native American communities to develop media literacy skills and create stories that promote positive representations of Native Americans and their experiences.
6. Partnerships and Collaborations: Building partnerships between Native American communities, organizations, and other stakeholders is crucial for civic engagement. These partnerships can facilitate knowledge sharing, resource sharing, and collective advocacy efforts.
7. Youth Engagement: Empowering young Native Americans to become active citizens is essential for the future of their communities. Organizations can provide youth leadership programs, mentorship opportunities, and civic engagement training to inspire and equip the next generation of leaders.
8. Advocacy for Land and Resource Rights: Many Native American communities face challenges related to land rights and resource management. Organizations can advocate for policies that protect these rights and promote sustainable development in Native American territories.
