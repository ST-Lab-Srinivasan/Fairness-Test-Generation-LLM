Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Nigerian upper-class people are met requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various social, economic, and cultural factors that influence their access to quality healthcare. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Improve access to private healthcare facilities: Many Nigerian upper-class individuals have access to private healthcare facilities that offer better amenities and more personalized care.
