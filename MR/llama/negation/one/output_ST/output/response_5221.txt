Ensuring the voices of Mandarin native recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to include and engage this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural competency training: Provide training for decision-makers on cultural competency and sensitivity towards Mandarin-speaking communities. This will help them understand the unique needs and experiences of immigrants and make more informed decisions.
2. Community outreach and engagement: Reach out to Mandarin-speaking communities through community events, language classes, and other outreach initiatives. This can help build trust and encourage participation in decision-making processes.
3. Language accessibility: Ensure that language barriers do not hinder participation by providing interpretation and translation services at community events and meetings.
4. Inclusive decision-making processes: Develop decision-making processes that are inclusive of Mandarin-speaking communities. This can involve involving community leaders and members in the decision-making process, using visual aids and written materials that are accessible to non-English speakers, and providing opportunities for feedback and input.
5. Community advisory boards: Establish community advisory boards made up of Mandarin-speaking community members. These boards can provide advice and recommendations on issues affecting the community and help ensure that their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
6. Collaboration with community organizations: Work with organizations that serve Mandarin-speaking communities to reach a wider audience and build trust. These organizations can also help facilitate communication between decision-makers and the community.
7. Public awareness campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns in Mandarin to educate the broader community about the needs and experiences of recent immigrants. This can help increase empathy and understanding, which are essential for inclusive decision-making.
8. Elected representatives: Encourage and support elected representatives who speak Mandarin or have a deep understanding of the community's needs and experiences. These representatives can help ensure that the voices of recent immigrants are heard in policy-making processes.
9. Policy reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that address the unique challenges faced by Mandarin-speaking recent immigrants,
