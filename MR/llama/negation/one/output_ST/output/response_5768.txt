Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American and recent immigrant individuals in the United States. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or community. For Native Americans and recent immigrants, their cultural heritage is closely tied to their sense of identity, as it provides a connection to their ancestors, history, and traditional ways of life.
