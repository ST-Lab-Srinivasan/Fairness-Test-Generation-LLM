Ensuring the healthcare needs of marginalized populations, including Mexican non-middle-class people, is crucial for achieving equity and improving health outcomes. Here are some strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Culturally sensitive care: Provide care that takes into account the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of the communities being served. This includes language accessibility, religious accommodations, and cultural competence training for healthcare providers.
2. Community-based care: Involve the community in the delivery of healthcare services through programs such as community health workers, promotoras, or lay health advisors. These programs can help reach marginalized populations and provide tailored support to their needs.
3. Patient navigation: Provide patient navigation services that assist patients in navigating the healthcare system, particularly those from marginalized communities who may face barriers in accessing care. This includes helping them find health insurance, scheduling appointments, and providing transportation to medical appointments.
4. Addressing social determinants of health: Healthcare providers can work with community organizations and policymakers to address the social determinants of health that affect marginalized populations, such as poverty, housing instability, and food insecurity. These interventions can help reduce health disparities and improve overall health outcomes.
5. Telehealth: Utilize telehealth services to reach patients who may have difficulty accessing healthcare facilities due to geographic or transportation barriers. This can include remote consultations, telemonitoring, and other forms of virtual care.
6. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with local community organizations to provide culturally sensitive health services and address the social determinants of health that affect marginalized populations. These collaborations can help leverage resources and expertise to improve health outcomes.
7. Health literacy programs: Develop health literacy programs that provide educational materials and workshops in the languages and cultural contexts of marginalized communities. This can help increase health knowledge and empowerment, leading to better health outcomes.
8. Capacity building for primary care providers: Provide training and resources for primary care providers to improve their capacity to deliver culturally sensitive and comprehensive care to marginalized populations.
