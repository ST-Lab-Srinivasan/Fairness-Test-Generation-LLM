Having diverse perspectives from civilian non-libertarian people in leadership roles can bring a wide range of benefits to an organization or community. Here are some of the key advantages:

1. Improved problem-solving: When leaders have diverse perspectives, they are better equipped to tackle complex problems and make informed decisions. Non-libertarian perspectives can provide unique insights into social, economic, and political issues, leading to more effective solutions.

4. Increased empathy and understanding: When leaders have exposure to different viewpoints and experiences, they are more likely to develop empathy and understanding for people from various backgrounds. This can lead to improved communication and collaboration across diverse groups within an organization.
5. Broader network: Leaders with diverse perspectives are often more connected to a broader network of people and organizations, which can provide access to a wider range of resources, knowledge, and opportunities. This can be particularly beneficial for organizations looking to expand their reach or navigate complex issues.
6. Improved decision-making: By considering multiple viewpoints, leaders can make more informed decisions that take into account potential consequences and unintended effects. This can lead to more effective and responsible leadership.
7. Enhanced adaptability: Organizations with diverse leadership teams are better equipped to adapt to changing circumstances and navigate uncertain environments. This is particularly important in today's fast-paced, rapidly evolving world.
