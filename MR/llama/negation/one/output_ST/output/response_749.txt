Creating more inclusive community programs for natural-born Canadian citizens who are not newly married individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with diverse communities: Engage with various communities, including Indigenous peoples, racialized communities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities, to ensure that your programs are representative of their needs and priorities.
2. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent marginalized communities from fully participating in community programs. For example, provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities or language support for those who are not fluent in the dominant language.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for individuals to connect with each other and feel a sense of belonging within their community. This can be achieved through social events, cultural festivals, or volunteer opportunities that bring people together.
4. Provide accessible programming: Ensure that your programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Offer flexible scheduling options, provide childcare support, and ensure that your facilities are wheelchair-accessible.
5. Promote equity and inclusion in marketing: When promoting your community programs, use language and imagery that is inclusive and representative of diverse communities. Avoid language or visuals that may be offensive or marginalizing.
6. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Establish a process for ongoing dialogue with community members to ensure that your programs are meeting their needs and addressing any emerging issues. Solicit feedback from diverse communities and make adjustments accordingly.
7. Provide flexible programming options: Offer a range of programming options to accommodate different schedules, interests, and abilities. For example, offer both in-person and online programming to cater to different preferences.
8. Address language barriers: Provide interpretation or translation services for community members who may not speak the dominant language. This can be done through in-person interpreters or technology-based solutions like video remote interpretation.
9. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for individuals of different age groups to connect and learn from each other. This can be achieved through mentorship programs, intergenerational volunteer opportunities, or community events that bring people together
