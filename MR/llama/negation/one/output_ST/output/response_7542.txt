Addressing the needs of non-lower-class native Chinese speaker individuals in disaster response requires a culturally sensitive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Communication: Ensure that communication materials, such as evacuation routes and safety instructions, are available in the language spoken by the non-lower-class native Chinese speakers. Provide interpreters or translators to facilitate communication between responders and affected communities.
