5. Access to resources: A mentor may have access to valuable resources such as funding, connections, or training opportunities that they can pass on to their mentee.
6. Personalized advice: A mentor can provide personalized advice based on their own experiences and knowledge of the industry or field. This can help the mentee to avoid common pitfalls and make more informed decisions.
7. Emotional support: A mentor can offer emotional support during challenging times, helping the mentee to stay motivated and focused on their goals.
8. Accountability: A mentor can hold the mentee accountable for their actions and progress, which can help to ensure that the mentee stays on track and achieves their goals.
9. Cultural capital: A mentor from a higher socio-economic background may be able to provide cultural capital to the mentee, such as knowledge of elite networks or institutions, which can help the mentee to navigate complex social situations.
