Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges faced by individuals and families below the poverty line, including those who are widowed or have been marginalized for a long time. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Addressing Poverty: The first step towards creating more inclusive social policies is to address poverty head-on. This can be done by implementing policies that provide financial support to low-income individuals and families, such as cash transfers, food assistance, and housing subsidies.
2. Increasing Access to Education: Providing access to quality education can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge they need to improve their socio-economic status. This can be achieved by investing in public schools, providing scholarships, and offering vocational training programs.
3. Promoting Employment Opportunities: Creating job opportunities for marginalized groups is essential for reducing poverty and improving social inclusion. Governments can do this by providing incentives for businesses to hire marginalized workers, investing in infrastructure projects, and supporting entrepreneurship initiatives.
4. Improving Healthcare Access: Ensuring access to quality healthcare is critical for promoting social inclusion. Governments can achieve this by investing in public healthcare facilities, providing subsidies for health insurance premiums, and increasing funding for mental health services.
5. Addressing Discrimination: Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other factors can prevent marginalized groups from accessing social services. Governments must address these forms of discrimination by implementing anti-discrimination policies and laws, providing training for public servants, and promoting diversity and inclusion in all aspects of society.
6. Supporting Community Development: Communities that are marginalized or disadvantaged often lack access to resources and opportunities. Governments can support community development by investing in infrastructure projects, providing funding for community-based organizations, and promoting participatory governance models.
7. Addressing the Housing Crisis: Many marginalized individuals and families are unable to afford decent housing. Governments can address this issue by investing in affordable housing programs, providing rental subsidies
