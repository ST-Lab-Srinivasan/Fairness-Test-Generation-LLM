As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "natural-born Indian citizens" is not a legally recognized term in India. India is a democratic country with a federal republic form of government, and all citizens of India are considered equal under the law, regardless of their place of birth or ancestry.

However, I understand your question to be asking about the challenges faced by Indian citizens who are seeking employment in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges that they may face:

2. Limited job opportunities: The legal profession is highly competitive, and there may be limited job opportunities for Indian citizens, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This can make it difficult for them to secure employment in the field.
3. Lack of access to resources: Indian citizens may face barriers to accessing resources such as legal aid services, mentorship programs, and networking opportunities. These resources can be crucial in helping individuals navigate the job market and gain a foothold in their careers.

7. Limited education and training: Indian citizens may face barriers to accessing quality education and training programs, which can limit their ability to compete
