Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including those who are naturalized citizens. In the case of Nigerian people, there are specific challenges and opportunities that arise from their immigration status. This section will explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of natural-born recently naturalized citizen Nigerian people.

Identity and Belonging:
For many Nigerian immigrants, obtaining citizenship can be a complex and challenging process. The journey to citizenship can be fraught with obstacles, including language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination. As a result, some naturalized citizens may struggle to find their place within the host society, feeling like they don't fully belong. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their new community.

Employment and Education:
Naturalized citizens may face additional barriers in the workplace or educational system due to their immigration status. Employers may be hesitant to hire individuals with non-traditional immigration status, and educational institutions may have limited resources available for students who are not U.S.-born. As a result, naturalized citizens may face challenges in finding employment or accessing educational opportunities that can help them achieve their goals.

Healthcare Access:
Access to healthcare is another area where immigration status can have a significant impact. Naturalized citizens may face barriers in accessing medical care, including language barriers and difficulty navigating complex healthcare systems. This can lead to delayed diagnosis or treatment of medical conditions, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.

Criminal Justice System:
Naturalized citizens may also face unique challenges within the criminal justice system. They may be more likely to be stopped or searched by law enforcement due to racial profiling or assumptions about their immigration status. Additionally, they may face language barriers when interacting with law enforcement or navigating the legal system.

Social Support:
Naturalized citizens may also experience challenges in building social connections and finding support within their host communities. Language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination can make it difficult for them to form meaningful relationships or access resources that can help them navigate their new environment.
