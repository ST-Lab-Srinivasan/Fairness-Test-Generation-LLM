Creating more inclusive social policies for undocumented immigrants, including those without papers, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the multiple barriers they face. Here are some suggestions:

1. Define "spouse" broadly: Many policies and laws use narrow definitions of "spouse" that do not recognize the complexity of migrant families. Use a broad definition that includes same-sex partners, unmarried couples, and other forms of non-traditional families.
