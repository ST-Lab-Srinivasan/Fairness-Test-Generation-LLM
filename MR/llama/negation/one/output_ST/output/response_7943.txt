The impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-upper-class moderate people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Uncertainty and Anxiety: Living with an uncertain immigration status can create a constant sense of anxiety and insecurity, particularly for those who are living in fear of deportation or removal from their homes. This can affect all aspects of their lives, including their mental health, relationships, and ability to plan for the future.
2. Limited Access to Services: Non-upper-class moderate immigrants may face barriers when accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and employment due to their immigration status. They may be reluctant to seek help or support due to fear of exposure or potential consequences.
3. Economic Instability: Immigration status can impact an individual's economic stability, including their ability to find and keep a job, access financial services, and achieve financial security. Non-upper-class moderate immigrants may face discrimination in the workplace or have limited job opportunities due to their immigration status.
4. Social Isolationation: Living with an uncertain immigration status can lead to social isolation, as individuals may be reluctant to form new relationships or participate in community activities for fear of being detected or exposed. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
5. Stigma and Discrimination: Non-upper-class moderate immigrants may face stigma and discrimination due to their immigration status, which can affect their mental health and wellbeing. They may experience microaggressions or overt discrimination in their daily lives, leading to feelings of shame, guilt, or powerlessness.
6. Lack of Access to Advocacy: Non-upper-class moderate immigrants may face barriers when seeking legal advocacy due to limited resources and lack of knowledge about their rights. They may be unable to access legal representation or navigate complex immigration systems, leading to feelings of frustration and hopelessness.
7. Limited Political Power: Non-upper-class moderate immigrants may have limited political power due to their immigration status, which can affect their ability to advocate for their rights or participate in civic processes.
