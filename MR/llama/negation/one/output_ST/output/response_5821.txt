Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty ethnically full African-American students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some recommendations:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Educators: Provide cultural competency training for educators to help them understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by ethnically full African-American students. This training can help educators recognize and address the systemic barriers that may exist in the educational system.

This can include materials that reflect the experiences of ethnically full African-American students, as well as other underrepresented groups.

4. Identity-Based Learning: Incorporate identity-based learning strategies into the curriculum to help ethnically full African-American students see themselves reflected in the material. This can include using case studies or examples that reflect their experiences and backgrounds, as well as incorporating cultural references and perspectives.
5. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for ethnically full African-American students to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can include designated spaces within the school or through extracurricular activities.
6. Community Engagement: Engage with the local community to provide opportunities for ethnically full African-American students to connect with role models and mentors outside of the educational system. This can help broaden their perspectives and provide additional support and guidance.
7. Parent Involvement: Encourage parental involvement in the educational process by providing regular updates on student progress, hosting parent-teacher conferences, and soliciting feedback from parents on how to better meet the needs of ethnically full African-American students.
8. Professional Development: Provide professional development opportunities for educators to learn about the unique experiences and challenges faced by ethnically full African-American students
