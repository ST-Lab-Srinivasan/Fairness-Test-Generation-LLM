Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for actively fully embracing non-binary identifying combat recently retired veteran individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities, such as "veterans" instead of "men" or "women." Avoid using binary language that assumes everyone identifies as male or female.
2. Gender-Neutral Costumes: Encourage participants to dress in costumes that are not specifically tied to traditional gender roles or stereotypes. Provide guidelines for creating costumes that are inclusive of all genders.
3. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that is relevant and meaningful to non-binary identifying veterans, such as workshops on mental health, trauma, and resilience. Make sure the content is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities.
4. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for non-binary identifying veterans to connect with each other and feel seen and heard. This can be done through dedicated events or activities that are specifically designed for this purpose.
5. Education and Training: Provide education and training on non-binary identity, the importance of inclusivity, and how to create a welcoming environment for all gender identities. This can be done through workshops, presentations, or online resources.
6. Collaboration with Non-Binary Organizations: Partner with organizations that support non-binary individuals, such as LGBTQ+ organizations, to ensure that the cultural celebration is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities.
7. Inclusive Promotional Materials: Use promotional materials that are inclusive of all genders, such as posters, flyers, or social media graphics. Avoid using binary language or imagery that may be alienating to non-binary individuals.
8. Accessibility and Accommodations: Ensure that the cultural celebration is accessible and inclusive for all participants, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or gender-neutral restrooms.
9. Inclusive Performances: Incorporate performances that are inclusive of all genders,
