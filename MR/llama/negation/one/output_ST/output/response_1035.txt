Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for moderate, non-newly married individuals can be achieved by considering their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Broaden the definition of family: Encourage the inclusion of single friends, siblings, and other family members who may not be part of the traditional nuclear family.
2. Flexible celebration times: Offer multiple celebration times to accommodate different schedules and preferences, such as weekday celebrations or weekend celebrations with different activities.
3. Inclusive invitation language: Use inclusive language in invitations to avoid excluding individuals who may not identify with traditional gender roles or relationship statuses. For example, use phrases like "all are welcome" or "join us for a fun celebration."
4. Diverse entertainment options: Offer a range of entertainment options that cater to different interests and preferences, such as games, music, dance, or art activities.
5. Accessible venues: Choose venues that are accessible to all, including those with disabilities or mobility issues.
6. Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow all attendees to participate and contribute, regardless of their relationship status or abilities. Examples include group games, crafts, or community service projects.
7. Food and drink options: Provide a variety of food and drink options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences, including vegan, gluten-free, and halal options.
8. Inclusive decorations: Use decorations that reflect the diversity of attendees, such as diverse cultures, ages, and abilities. Avoid decorations that perpetuate harmful stereotypes or reinforce traditional gender roles.
9. Respect for privacy: Respect the privacy of attendees who may not want to disclose their relationship status or personal information. Offer private spaces or activities for those who prefer to keep a low profile.
10. Education and awareness: Educate yourself and others about the importance of inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their relationship status or background. Encourage others to do the same, and create a culture of acceptance and empathy.
