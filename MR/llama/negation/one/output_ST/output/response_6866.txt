Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of non-upper-class, non-conservative people. Here are some potential effects:

1. Discrimination and stigma: Non-upper-class, non-conservative immigrants may face discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status. This can lead to social isolation, low self-esteem, and mental health issues.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Immigrants without legal status may face barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities, which can limit their career advancement and earning potential.
3. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to anxiety, stress, and a lack of stability in the lives of non-upper-class, non-conservative immigrants. This fear can also impact their mental health and overall well-being.
4. Limited access to healthcare: Immigrants without legal status may face barriers to accessing healthcare services, which can result in delayed or inadequate medical care. This can have serious consequences, particularly for those with chronic conditions or who are pregnant.
5. Financial instability: Non-upper-class, non-conservative immigrants may face financial instability due to their immigration status. They may struggle to access financial resources, such as loans or credit, which can limit their ability to invest in their future or cover basic living expenses.
6. Limited social services: Immigrants without legal status may have limited access to social services, such as housing assistance or food aid. This can make it difficult for them to meet their basic needs and maintain a stable living situation.
7. Lack of representation: Non-upper-class, non-conservative immigrants may have limited access to legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complex immigration system and advocate for their rights.
8. Strain on family relationships: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can impact the mental health and well-being of non-upper-class, non-conservative immigrants' family members, particularly children.
