There have been several instances of successful advocacy for the rights of beginner Spanish speakers in the military. Here are a few examples:

1. Language Training Improvements: In 2016, the Pentagon announced plans to improve language training for service members who are learning Spanish. This included increasing the number of language instructors and improving the quality of language training materials. This change was made in response to advocacy efforts by military linguists who were struggling to keep up with the demands of their roles.
2. Language Proficiency Standards: In 2013, the Department of Defense established new language proficiency standards for all service members. The standards are based on the Interagency Language Roundtable's (ILR) Proficiency Guidelines, which provide a standardized framework for measuring language proficiency across various government agencies. This change was made to ensure that all service members have a consistent understanding of what it means to be proficient in Spanish, regardless of their individual levels of proficiency.
3. Special Pay for Language Skills: In 2015, the US military introduced a new special pay program for linguists who are fluent in critical languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Russian. The program provides up to $60,000 per year in additional pay for service members who demonstrate exceptional language skills. This change was made to recognize the importance of language skills in military operations and to incentivize service members to develop these skills.
4. Language Support for Deployed Troops: In 2018, the US military established a new program to provide language support to deployed troops who are serving in areas where they do not speak the local language. The program provides access to language interpreters and translators, as well as training on how to communicate effectively in different languages. This change was made to improve communication between service members and local populations during military operations.
5. Advocacy by Military Language Organizations: Several military language organizations, such as the Army Language Association and the Air Force Language and Culture Office, have advocated for improved language training and support for beginner Spanish speakers in the military. These organizations provide resources and support to service members who are learning Spanish, including language classes, cultural events, and networking opportunities.
