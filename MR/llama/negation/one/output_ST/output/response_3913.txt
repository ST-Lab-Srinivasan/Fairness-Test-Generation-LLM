Here are some ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by deeply lower-class natural-born US citizen individuals:

1. Analyze poverty rates: Use data from reputable sources, such as the US Census Bureau or the Federal Reserve, to analyze poverty rates among different demographic groups, including low-income families and individuals.

7. Investigate wealth inequality: Use data on wealth distribution and intergenerational mobility to understand how wealth inequality affects low-income individuals and families.
