I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice on how to create cultural celebrations that are exclusive or discriminatory towards any particular group of people, including the elderly or LGBTQ+ individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their age, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating inclusive cultural celebrations that promote diversity and inclusivity for all individuals. Here are some general tips to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of diverse groups: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices and beliefs of different communities, including those who may be marginalized or underrepresented. This can help ensure that your celebration is inclusive and respectful of all participants.
2. Involve diverse voices in planning and decision-making: Ensure that a diverse group of people are involved in planning and decision-making processes, including individuals from different backgrounds and identities. This can help ensure that the celebration is representative of the community and meets the needs of all participants.
3. Provide accommodations for diverse needs: Consider the physical, emotional, and cultural needs of participants when planning your celebration. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or cultural rituals that are sensitive to the needs of different communities.
4. Promote representation and inclusion in media and programming: Ensure that your celebration includes a diverse range of performers, speakers, and content that reflects the experiences and perspectives of different communities. This can help promote representation and inclusion for marginalized groups.
5. Foster a culture of respect and inclusivity: Encourage all participants to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity. Promote a culture of inclusivity and empathy throughout the celebration.
