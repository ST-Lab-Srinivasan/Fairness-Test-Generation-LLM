Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Beginner Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially for those who are not recently divorced. In the case of beginner Spanish speakers, cultural heritage can influence their language learning experiences, cultural practices, and overall identity formation. This research paper aims to explore the relationship between cultural heritage and the identities of beginner Spanish speakers, focusing on how cultural heritage shapes their language learning experiences and identities.

 Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on identity formation. For instance, Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions theory posits that cultural differences in values, beliefs, and practices shape individuals' identities. Similarly, Gudykunst and Ting-Toomey's (1988) intercultural communication model suggests that cultural differences can influence communication styles and relationships. In the context of language learning, research has shown that learners' cultural backgrounds can affect their language acquisition strategies (Kiraly & Szabo, 2006).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using interviews with beginner Spanish speakers to gather data. Participants will be recruited through local language schools and online language learning communities. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to collect data on participants' cultural backgrounds, language learning experiences, and identities. Thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Expected Findings:
The findings of this study are expected to provide insights into how cultural heritage influences the identities of beginner Spanish speakers. Specifically, the study aims to uncover the following:

1. How do participants' cultural backgrounds affect their language learning experiences and identities?
2. How do participants perceive their own cultural identity in relation to their language learning journey?
3. What role does cultural heritage play in shaping participants' attitudes towards Spanish culture and language?

Significance:
This study contributes to the existing literature on language learning and cultural identity by exploring the unique experiences of beginner Spanish speakers. The findings can
