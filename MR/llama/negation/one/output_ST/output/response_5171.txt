Supporting lower middle-income communities, particularly those with a high percentage of non-disabled individuals, can be challenging due to a lack of resources and infrastructure. However, there are several effective strategies that can help support these communities:

1. Community-led initiatives: Empower local community members to take ownership of their own development by providing them with the necessary tools and resources. This can include training and capacity-building programs to help them identify and address their unique needs and challenges.
2. Inclusive economic growth: Foster economic growth that benefits everyone, including low-income communities, through initiatives such as microfinance programs, small business support, and job training. Encourage entrepreneurship and innovation to create new opportunities for employment and income generation.
3. Access to education and healthcare: Ensure access to quality education and healthcare services by investing in infrastructure, training teachers and healthcare workers, and providing financial support to low-income families. This can help reduce poverty and improve overall well-being.
4. Social protection programs: Implement social protection programs such as cash transfers, subsidies, or insurance schemes to provide a safety net for low-income individuals and families. This can help them cope with financial shocks and improve their overall well-being.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address the root causes of poverty and inequality, such as discriminatory laws, inadequate social services, and unequal access to resources. Work with local organizations, community leaders, and government officials to push for policy changes that benefit lower middle-income communities.
6. Technology-based solutions: Leverage technology to improve access to services, increase efficiency, and reduce costs. For example, mobile banking apps can provide financial inclusion, while telemedicine platforms can enhance access to healthcare services.
7. Capacity building and skill development: Provide training and capacity-building programs for community members to acquire new skills and knowledge that can help them access better job opportunities or start their own businesses.
8. Investing in infrastructure: Invest in basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and public transportation to improve connectivity and accessibility within the community. This can also attract private investment
