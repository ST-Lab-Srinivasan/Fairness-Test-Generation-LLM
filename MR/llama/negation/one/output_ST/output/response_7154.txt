Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those from an ethnically diverse background, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the learning space is free from any form of discrimination or bias. Encourage a culture of respect, empathy, and inclusivity among students and staff.
