Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for late 30s beginner Spanish speaker individuals can be achieved by taking into account their language proficiency level and providing opportunities for them to participate in a meaningful way. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Offer translation services or provide written materials in both the target language (Spanish) and the participants' native language. This will help bridge the language gap and make it easier for beginners to understand and participate in the celebration.
2. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, videos, or props to help communicate cultural information and traditions. This can be especially helpful for beginners who may struggle with understanding complex verbal explanations.
3. Foster an inclusive atmosphere: Encourage participants to share their thoughts and experiences during the celebration. This can be done through group discussions, icebreakers, or other interactive activities that promote participation and mutual understanding.
4. Offer beginner-friendly activities: Plan activities that are tailored to beginners' language proficiency levels. For example, you could have a simple cultural quiz or a fun game that requires minimal Spanish language skills.
5. Use authentic materials: Incorporate authentic cultural elements such as songs, dances, and traditions into the celebration. This will help participants connect with the culture in a meaningful way and make the experience more enjoyable for beginners.
6. Provide opportunities for practice: Offer participants multiple opportunities to practice their Spanish language skills during the celebration. This could include conversational activities, role-playing exercises, or even a simple language exchange program.
7. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be respectful and considerate of the culture being celebrated. Avoid using cultural elements in a way that is disrespectful or insensitive to the original context.
8. Involve participants in the planning process: Encourage beginners to contribute their ideas and suggestions for the celebration. This will help them feel more invested in the event and make it more enjoyable for everyone involved.
9. Use technology to facilitate participation: Utilize digital tools such as online chat platforms, video conferencing software, or language learning apps to enable participants to participate in the celebration remotely.
