As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or biases towards any particular race or ethnic group. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by advanced aged (over 90 years old) ethnically full African-American people in the legal system based on available data and research. Please note that these are general challenges and may not be applicable to every individual.

1. Health issues: Advanced age can lead to declining physical and cognitive abilities, which can impact an individual's ability to navigate the legal system. African-Americans over 90 years old may face more significant health challenges compared to their white counterparts due to disparities in access to healthcare, nutrition, and other factors that can affect their overall well-being.
2. Limited social support: Older adults, especially those living alone or without close family members or caregivers, may struggle with daily tasks and decision-making due to cognitive decline or mobility issues. This lack of social support can make it more challenging for African-American seniors to access legal resources or advocate for their rights.
3. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against African-Americans still exist in various forms, including within the legal system. Older African-American individuals may face ageism, racism, or both, which can lead to unequal treatment under the law.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Many older African-Americans may lack access to legal resources, such as low-cost or pro bono legal services, due to financial constraints or limited transportation options. This can make it more challenging for them to navigate complex legal procedures or advocate for their rights.
5. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system can be unfamiliar and intimidating for many older African-Americans, who may face barriers related to cultural differences, language proficiency, or historical trauma. Legal professionals must be aware of these challenges and take steps to provide culturally competent services that address the unique needs of this population.
6. Cognitive decline: As people age, their cognitive abilities can decline, which can affect their ability to understand complex legal concepts or navigate legal procedures. Older African-American individuals may require additional support
