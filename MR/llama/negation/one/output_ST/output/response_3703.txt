Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who have been through challenging experiences such as divorce and multiple marriages, requires a compassionate and inclusive approach. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language Support: Provide language classes or connect them with resources that can help them improve their English language skills. This will help them communicate more effectively in their daily lives and feel more connected to their community.
2. Cultural Adaptation: Help them adapt to American culture by providing information about local customs, traditions, and values. You could also organize cultural events or activities that celebrate their heritage and promote cross-cultural understanding.

4. Social Networking: Encourage them to join community groups or clubs that align with their interests. This could be anything from a book club to a sports team. Socializing with others can help them build friendships and feel more connected to their community.
5. Mental Health Support: Provide access to mental health resources, such as counseling services or support groups. Many immigrants experience stress and trauma related to their experiences, and these resources can help them manage their emotional well-being.
6. Legal Support: Offer legal aid services to help them navigate the complexities of the US immigration system. This could include assistance with obtaining visas, citizenship, or other legal documents.
