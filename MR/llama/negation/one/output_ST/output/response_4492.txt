Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including native Chinese speakers and recent immigrants to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these groups:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients who may have different communication styles or language barriers. This can lead to better understanding and more accurate diagnosis and treatment.
