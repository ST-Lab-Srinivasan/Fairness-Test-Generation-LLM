As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their marital status or length of time in the United States, deserve equal rights and opportunities for social inclusion. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of natural-born US citizens who may not be long-time married:

1. Encourage diversity and inclusivity: Foster a culture of acceptance and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background or marital status. Promote diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of life, including education, employment, and social events.
2. Provide access to resources: Ensure that natural-born US citizens have access to the same opportunities as everyone else, such as quality education, healthcare, and economic stability. This can help reduce inequality and promote social mobility.
3. Address discrimination: Identify and address any forms of discrimination or bias that may exist against natural-born US citizens who are not long-time married. This can include advocating for policies that protect against discrimination based on marital status.
4. Promote intergenerational connections: Encourage natural-born US citizens to connect with older generations, such as through mentorship programs or community events. This can help build bridges between different age groups and promote social cohesion.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for natural-born US citizens to feel connected to their communities and the country as a whole. This can include encouraging participation in civic activities, cultural events, or volunteer work.
6. Support immigrant integration: Encourage and support the integration of immigrants into US society, as they are also often faced with unique challenges related to social inclusion. This can involve advocating for policies that promote language access, cultural competency training, and other forms of support.
7. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent natural-born US citizens from achieving social inclusion, such as discriminatory laws or practices, unequal access to education or employment opportunities, or inadequate social safety nets.
