1. Conduct Needs Assessment: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment to identify the specific needs of long-term widowed individuals in Nigeria. This will help you understand their social, economic, and cultural contexts, as well as their health and wellbeing requirements.
2. Involve Widows in Program Design: Engage widows in the design and implementation of community programs to ensure that they are inclusive and responsive to their needs. This can be done through focus groups, surveys, or other participatory methods.
3. Provide Access to Healthcare: Offer healthcare services tailored to the specific needs of long-term widowed individuals, including mental health support, nutrition counseling, and access to basic medical care.
