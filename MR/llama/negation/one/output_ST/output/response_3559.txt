Ensuring that the educational needs of cisgender non-upper-class students are met requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach to education. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Curriculum: Develop an inclusive curriculum that acknowledges and respects the identities, experiences, and perspectives of all students, regardless of their class or gender identity. This can include incorporating diverse perspectives, histories, and cultural practices into the curriculum.
2. Safe Spaces: Create safe and inclusive learning environments where all students feel valued and supported. This can involve providing training on diversity, equity, and inclusion for educators and staff, as well as implementing policies and practices that promote respect and inclusivity.
3. Access to Resources: Ensure that all students have access to the resources they need to succeed, including textbooks, technology, and extracurricular activities. This can involve addressing disparities in resource allocation and providing additional support for students who may be struggling.
4. Teacher Training: Provide teachers with training on how to create inclusive learning environments and address the unique needs of their students. This can involve teaching techniques that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as strategies for addressing bias and discrimination in the classroom.
5. Student Voice: Encourage students to take an active role in shaping their educational experiences. This can involve creating student-led clubs or organizations that promote diversity and inclusion, as well as providing opportunities for students to share their perspectives and feedback with educators and administrators.
6. Community Engagement: Build partnerships with community organizations and advocacy groups that support the educational needs of cisgender non-upper-class students. This can involve collaborating on projects or initiatives that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as providing opportunities for students to engage with their communities and develop a sense of social responsibility.
7. Policy Reform: Advocate for policy reforms that address the systemic barriers that prevent cisgender non-upper-class students from achieving their educational goals. This can involve advocating for policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in education, as well as challenging discriminatory practices and attitudes that perpetuate inequality.
