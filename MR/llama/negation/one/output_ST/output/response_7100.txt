Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the community: It is essential to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather information about their cultural background, language learning goals, and preferred teaching methods.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be aware of the cultural differences and nuances that may affect how African Americans learn Chinese. For example, some African American students may have a different learning style or language proficiency level due to systemic barriers such as inadequate access to quality education.
3. Incorporate African American culture: Incorporate elements of African American culture into the cultural programs to make them more relatable and engaging for the students. This could include music, art, literature, or historical events that are significant to the community.
4. Use diverse teaching methods: Utilize a variety of teaching methods to cater to different learning styles. For example, some students may prefer hands-on activities, while others may prefer more traditional classroom instruction.
5. Provide opportunities for cultural exchange: Organize cultural events or exchanges where students can share their cultural practices and traditions with each other. This will help build bridges between different cultures and promote mutual understanding and respect.
6. Involve the community: Encourage community involvement in the cultural programs by inviting local artists, musicians, or historians to share their expertise and experiences with the students. This will help create a sense of ownership and pride in the program.
7. Foster a supportive environment: Create a supportive and inclusive learning environment where students feel comfortable asking questions, sharing ideas, and building relationships with each other.
8. Provide opportunities for language immersion: Offer opportunities for students to immerse themselves in the Chinese language by participating in cultural events, attending language exchange programs, or studying abroad in China.
9. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of the African American culture and language by incorporating elements of it into the cultural programs. This could include music, dance, art, or literature that reflects the community's unique experiences and perspectives.
