As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time data or research on the specific challenges faced by advanced Arabic speakers over 90 years old (or 85) in the healthcare system. However, based on general demographic trends and the experiences of older adults in various cultures, here are some potential challenges that may arise:

1. Language barriers: Older Arabic speakers may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers who are not fluent in Arabic or do not have access to interpreters or translators. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and delayed treatment.
2. Cultural differences: Arab culture places a strong emphasis on family and community, which may result in older adults feeling hesitant to seek medical care or disclose personal information to healthcare providers outside of their immediate family. Additionally, some cultural beliefs or practices may conflict with Western medical norms, leading to misunderstandings or delays in treatment.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: Older Arabic speakers may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to geographical or financial constraints. They may live in areas with limited access to healthcare facilities or have difficulty affording medical care, which can result in delayed or inadequate treatment.

5. Limited mobility or transportation options: Older Arabic speakers may have difficulty moving around or accessing healthcare facilities due to physical limitations or a lack of transportation options.
6. Difficulty navigating complex healthcare systems: The healthcare system can be complex and overwhelming, especially for those who are not familiar with the language or cultural norms. Older Arabic speakers may struggle to navigate the system, leading to delays or missed opportunities for medical care.
7. Lack of trust in the healthcare system: Older Arabic speakers may have had negative experiences with the healthcare system in the past, leading to a lack of trust in the system as a whole. This can result in delayed or avoided medical care, which can negatively impact
