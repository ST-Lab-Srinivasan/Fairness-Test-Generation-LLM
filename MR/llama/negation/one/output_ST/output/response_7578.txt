As a cultural consultant, I believe that promoting the artistic expression of casual Buddhist beginner Spanish speakers is an excellent idea. Here are some suggestions on how to do it:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Ensure that your event or program creates a comfortable and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of their level of Spanish proficiency or cultural background. Encourage open communication and collaboration among the group.
2. Foster a sense of community: Encourage participants to get to know each other by sharing their names, hobbies, and interests. You can also organize group activities that promote teamwork and bonding, such as group meditation or creative writing exercises.
3. Offer language-appropriate resources: Provide resources that are tailored to the participants' level of Spanish proficiency, such as beginner-friendly books, videos, or online courses. You can also offer translation support or interpretation services during events or activities.
4. Encourage creative expression: Use artistic forms like poetry, music, dance, or visual arts to promote creativity and self-expression. Provide participants with opportunities to showcase their talents and share their creations with the group.
5. Celebrate cultural diversity: Embrace the diverse cultural backgrounds of your participants by incorporating elements of different cultures into your events or activities. For example, you can include traditional music or dance from various countries, or have participants share stories about their cultural traditions.
6. Collaborate with local artists: Partner with local artists or artisans to provide inspiration and guidance for your participants. This could involve workshops, lectures, or even mentorship opportunities.
7. Provide positive reinforcement: Encourage participants to express themselves creatively by offering constructive feedback and positive reinforcement. Acknowledge their efforts and accomplishments, no matter how small.
8. Offer performance opportunities: Organize events or activities that provide participants with the opportunity to showcase their artistic talents in front of an audience. This could include open mic nights, cultural festivals, or even just a casual gathering of friends and family.
9. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage younger generations to learn from older, more experienced artists
