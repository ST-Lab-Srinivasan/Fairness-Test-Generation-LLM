People living in deep poverty during their third trimester of pregnancy face significant challenges within the legal system. These challenges can exacerbate the already difficult situation they are facing and may result in a lack of access to basic rights and services. Some of the challenges faced by these individuals include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Deeply impoverished pregnant women may struggle to access quality prenatal care, leading to potential health complications for both the mother and the baby. They may also face barriers in accessing obstetric care during the third trimester, which can further increase the risk of complications.
2. Lack of legal representation: Many deeply impoverished individuals may not have access to legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights. This can lead to a lack of awareness about their legal options and potential risks associated with their situation.
3. Discrimination and stigma: Pregnant women living in poverty may face discrimination and stigma from healthcare providers, social workers, and other individuals within the legal system. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, making it more challenging for them to access necessary services and support.
4. Lack of awareness about their rights: Deeply impoverished pregnant women may be unaware of their legal rights and options, such as the right to prenatal care, the right to financial support during pregnancy, and the right to protection from domestic violence.
5. Limited access to social services: Pregnant women living in poverty may struggle to access social services, such as food assistance programs, housing support, and job training. This can further exacerbate their economic and social challenges.
6. Difficulty navigating bureaucratic systems: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for individuals who lack access to resources and support. Deeply impoverished pregnant women may face additional challenges in accessing the resources they need to protect their rights and ensure a healthy pregnancy.
7. Lack of affordable childcare: After giving birth, these women may struggle to find affordable childcare options, which can limit their ability to seek employment or access education and training opportunities.
