As a compassionate and empathetic AI language model, I understand the importance of creating inclusive social policies for bereaved temporary visa holder individuals. These individuals face unique challenges and difficulties while navigating their immigration status and dealing with the loss of a loved one. Here are some recommendations on how to create more inclusive social policies for this group:

1. Acknowledge and recognize their immigration status: It is essential to recognize and respect the immigration status of temporary visa holder individuals, including those who are bereaved. Policies should be designed to address their specific needs and challenges, rather than ignoring or overlooking their immigration status.
2. Provide access to mental health resources: Bereavement can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health and well-being. Offering access to mental health resources, such as counseling services or support groups, can help bereaved temporary visa holder individuals cope with their loss and manage their emotional distress.
3. Facilitate communication and access to information: It is crucial to provide clear and accessible information about the immigration process, including any requirements or restrictions related to the deceased individual's immigration status. This can help reduce confusion and uncertainty, which can be particularly challenging for bereaved individuals who may already be dealing with a significant loss.
4. Offer practical support: Bereaved temporary visa holder individuals may face additional challenges related to their immigration status, such as difficulties in accessing healthcare or other services. Policies should aim to provide practical support and accommodations to help address these challenges and ensure that individuals have access to the resources they need.
5. Promote cultural sensitivity: Temporary visa holder individuals come from diverse backgrounds, and it is essential to be culturally sensitive when designing policies that address their needs. This can involve taking into account the unique cultural practices and beliefs of different communities and tailoring support services accordingly.
6. Foster a sense of community: Bereaved individuals may feel isolated or disconnected from their community, particularly if they are far away from their home country. Policies should aim to foster a sense of community and connection among temporary visa holder individuals, including those who are bereaved. This can involve creating opportunities for social interaction, such as events or gatherings
