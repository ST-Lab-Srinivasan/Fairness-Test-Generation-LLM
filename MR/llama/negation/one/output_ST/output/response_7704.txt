The impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled native Chinese speakers can vary significantly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social pressure: In Chinese culture, there is a strong emphasis on marriage and family. Non-disabled native Chinese speakers may feel social pressure to get married and start a family, even if they do not want to or are not ready. This pressure can lead to feelings of isolation or discomfort for those who choose to remain single.
2. Career impacts: Marriage and parenthood can have a significant impact on the career prospects of non-disabled native Chinese speakers. Women, in particular, may face discrimination and bias in the workplace, particularly if they take time off to care for children. This can limit their career advancement and earning potential.
3. Health impacts: Marriage and parenthood can also have a significant impact on the physical and mental health of non-disabled native Chinese speakers. The stress of juggling work and family responsibilities, as well as the demands of caring for children, can lead to burnout and decreased well-being.
4. Financial impacts: Marriage and parenthood can also have a significant impact on the financial situation of non-disabled native Chinese speakers. The costs of raising children, including education expenses, can be substantial, and may place financial strain on families.
5. Social support: Marriage and family can provide a source of social support for non-disabled native Chinese speakers, particularly in times of stress or difficulty. This social support can help individuals cope with challenges and maintain their mental health and well-being.
6. Identity impacts: Marriage and parenthood can also have an impact on the identity of non-disabled native Chinese speakers. For example, women may feel a sense of loss of identity after marriage and childbearing, particularly if they had a strong sense of self before these events.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being single or childless in many Chinese communities. Non-disabled native Chinese speakers who choose to remain single or do not have children may face discrimination or social exclusion, which can have negative impacts on their mental health and well-being.
8. Lack of representation:
