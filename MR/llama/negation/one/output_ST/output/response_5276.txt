Creating more inclusive housing policies for recently pregnant women, particularly those in their third trimester, and not long-time married individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some recommendations to make housing more accessible and supportive:

1. Accommodation options: Offer flexible lease terms or temporary accommodation options for pregnant women who may need additional support during their final months of pregnancy. This could include temporary relocation to a nearby hotel or short-term rental property until they are ready to return home.
2. Accessibility features: Ensure that housing units have been modified to be more accessible and comfortable for pregnant women, particularly those in their third trimester. This could include installing grab bars in the bathroom, widening doorways, and providing ergonomic furniture.
3. Modified workplace policies: Encourage employers to provide modified workplace policies that accommodate pregnant employees' needs, such as flexible work schedules, job modifications, or temporary reductions in workload. This can help reduce stress and discomfort during this time.
4. Social support networks: Create social support networks for pregnant women, particularly those who may be experiencing isolation or loneliness during their final months of pregnancy. This could include regular check-ins with a healthcare provider, peer support groups, or counseling services.
5. Education and resources: Provide education and resources on prenatal care, birthing options, and postpartum care to help pregnant women make informed decisions about their health and well-being. This could include workshops on breastfeeding, baby care, and self-care techniques.
6. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language when communicating with pregnant women, acknowledging their individual experiences and needs. For example, instead of assuming all pregnant women are married or in a relationship, ask how they prefer to be referred to.
7. Financial support: Offer financial support options for pregnant women who may be experiencing financial stress during this time. This could include emergency assistance funds or resources on budgeting and managing finances during pregnancy.
8. Access to healthcare: Ensure that pregnant women have access to quality, affordable healthcare
