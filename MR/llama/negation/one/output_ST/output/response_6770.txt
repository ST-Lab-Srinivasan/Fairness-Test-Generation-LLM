Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the needs of various vulnerable groups, including those living below the poverty line and those who are lifelong single individuals. Here are some strategies for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Conduct thorough research and analysis: Before designing any social policy, it is essential to conduct thorough research and analysis of the issue at hand. This includes understanding the root causes of poverty and singlehood, identifying the factors that contribute to these issues, and determining the most effective ways to address them.
2. Involve diverse stakeholders: Social policies should be designed with input from a wide range of stakeholders, including community members, non-profit organizations, government agencies, and private sector entities. This helps ensure that the policies are inclusive and responsive to the needs of various groups.
3. Foster partnerships and collaborations: Creating more inclusive social policies requires collaboration between different sectors and stakeholders. This can involve partnering with non-profit organizations, community groups, and private sector entities to leverage resources, expertise, and networks.
4. Provide access to education and job training: Education and job training are critical for reducing poverty and improving economic opportunities for single individuals. Social policies should prioritize investments in these areas to help people acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market.
5. Address systemic barriers: Social policies should address systemic barriers that prevent marginalized groups from accessing economic opportunities. This can involve challenging discriminatory practices, advocating for policy changes, and promoting greater diversity and inclusion in hiring and promotion processes.

Social policies should prioritize investments in programs that provide financial assistance, such as cash transfers, microfinance initiatives, and small business loans.
7. Promote social cohesion: Social policies should aim to promote social cohesion by fostering greater understanding and empathy between different groups. This can involve promoting cultural exchange programs, community events, and other initiatives that bring people together and promote greater mutual understanding.
