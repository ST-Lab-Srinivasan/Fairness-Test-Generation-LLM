As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that supporting the educational aspirations of recently single people or those in their third trimester of pregnancy requires sensitivity, empathy, and understanding. Here are some ways to provide support:

1. Offer emotional support: Recognize that the transition to singlehood or pregnancy can be challenging, and offer a listening ear and words of encouragement. Let them know that they are not alone and that you are there to support them.
2. Help with practical tasks: During pregnancy, simple tasks like grocery shopping and cooking can become difficult. Offer to help with these tasks or provide meals or other necessities. Similarly, as a single person navigates their new life, offer help with tasks like household chores, errands, or childcare.
3. Encourage self-care: Pregnancy and singlehood can both be stressful, so encourage the individual to prioritize self-care. Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress relief, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature.
4. Provide resources and information: Offer to provide information on local resources, such as parenting classes, job training programs, or financial assistance. Help them connect with professionals who can guide them through this challenging period.
5. Respect their boundaries: Be mindful of the individual's feelings and respect their boundaries. Avoid pushing them to talk about things they are not ready to discuss, and let them know that you are there for them when they are ready.
6. Offer to babysit or help with childcare: If the individual is a single parent or expecting a child, offer to babysit or help with childcare tasks. This can be a significant burden off their shoulders and allow them to focus on their own needs.
7. Be a sounding board: Offer to listen to their thoughts, feelings, and concerns without judgment. Let them know that you are there to support them emotionally as well as practically.
8. Help with financial planning: Pregnancy and singlehood can both be financially challenging. Offer to help with budgeting, debt management, or finding resources for financial assistance.
9. Encourage social connections: Isolation
