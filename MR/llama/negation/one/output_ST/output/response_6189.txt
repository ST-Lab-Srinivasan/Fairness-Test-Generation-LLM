Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent immigrants to the US, including those who are ethnically full Caucasian. Here are some ways cultural heritage can impact their experiences:

This can be especially important for immigrants who may feel disconnected from their adopted country due to cultural differences or discrimination.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity and sense of self. For example, a recent immigrant from Europe to the US may identify as both European and American, with each culture influencing their worldview and values.
3.

For example, the African diaspora has used cultural heritage as a means of challenging racism and advocating for civil rights.
