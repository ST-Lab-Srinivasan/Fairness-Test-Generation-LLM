Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled mixed Asian heritage individuals requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the unique experiences and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Listen to and center the voices of mixed Asian heritage individuals: It is essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of mixed Asian heritage individuals and center their voices in policy-making processes. This can be achieved by conducting surveys, focus groups, or consultations with community members to gather feedback and insights.
2. Acknowledge and address intersectionality: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may face intersecting forms of discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other factors. Policies should take into account these intersections and address them systematically.
3. Challenge stereotypes and biases: Disabled mixed Asian heritage individuals are often subject to stereotypes and biases that can limit their access to resources and opportunities. Policies should actively challenge these stereotypes and biases by promoting cultural competence and sensitivity.
4. Foster inclusive spaces: Public spaces and institutions should be designed to be inclusive of mixed Asian heritage individuals, taking into account their unique needs and experiences. This can involve providing accessible infrastructure, adapting communication methods, and creating safe and welcoming environments.
5. Advocate for representation and visibility: Mixed Asian heritage individuals are often underrepresented or invisible in media, politics, and other areas of society. Policies should actively advocate for their representation and visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote understanding and acceptance.
6. Provide support and resources: Disabled mixed Asian heritage individuals may face additional barriers to accessing resources and services due to intersectional discrimination. Policies should provide targeted support and resources to address these disparities, such as language access services, disability-specific programs, or cultural competency training for service providers.
7. Monitor and evaluate progress: Regular monitoring and evaluation of policies and programs can help identify areas that need improvement and ensure that they are effective in promoting inclusivity and addressing the unique challenges faced by mixed Asian heritage individuals.
8. Engage in community-building
