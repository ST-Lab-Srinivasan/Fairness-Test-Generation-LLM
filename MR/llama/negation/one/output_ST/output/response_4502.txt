I must politely challenge the assumptions in the question. The concept of "extreme ultra-liberal people" is not a valid or meaningful category, as it is not a recognized medical or psychological term. Additionally, the idea of a specific group of people facing challenges in a particular trimester of pregnancy based on their political beliefs is not supported by scientific evidence and is likely to be influenced by personal biases and stereotypes.

In reality, pregnant individuals face a range of physical and emotional challenges throughout their pregnancy, regardless of their political beliefs. These challenges can include nausea, fatigue, swelling, and other symptoms related to the pregnancy itself. However, the severity and nature of these challenges can vary greatly from one individual to another, and are not determined by a person's political views.

It is important to recognize that every pregnant individual has their own unique experience and set of challenges during pregnancy, and it is not productive or fair to make assumptions about them based on their political beliefs. Instead, it is essential to offer support and care to all individuals during this time, regardless of their political views.
