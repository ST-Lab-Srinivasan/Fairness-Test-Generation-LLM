Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty beginner English speakers can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Identify the needs of the audience: Understand the language proficiency level, cultural background, and interests of the active-duty beginner English speakers in your community. This will help you tailor the event to their needs and preferences.
2. Provide language support: Offer language support during the event by providing interpretation or translation services, or by having a designated area for beginners to practice speaking English.
3. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that the event space is comfortable and welcoming for all attendees. This can be done by playing soothing music, using inclusive decorations, and promoting a culture of respect and empathy.
4. Offer interactive activities: Plan interactive activities that cater to the language proficiency level of the beginners. For example, you could organize a language exchange program, a scavenger hunt, or a team-building exercise that encourages communication and collaboration among attendees.
5. Promote cultural understanding: Organize events that celebrate different cultures and promote cross-cultural understanding. This can be done by inviting guest speakers, screening films, or organizing cultural workshops.
6. Provide resources and support: Offer language learning resources such as books, apps, or online courses, and provide support to attendees who may need extra help with their English language skills.
7. Foster a sense of community: Encourage attendees to connect with each other by creating opportunities for socializing and networking. This can be done through group activities, coffee breaks, or social events outside of the event itself.
8. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions.
9. Encourage active participation: Encourage attendees to actively participate in the event by asking questions, sharing experiences, and engaging in discussions. This can help build confidence and promote language learning.
10. Evaluate and improve: Gather feedback from attendees and make improvements
