The concept of cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American natural-born US citizens. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. For Native Americans, their cultural heritage is deeply connected to their history, language, and spiritual practices, which have been impacted by the colonization and marginalization they have faced throughout history.

Native American cultural heritage has been shaped by their experiences of displacement, forced assimilation, and cultural erasure. The loss of land, language, and cultural practices has led to a sense of disconnection from their ancestral lands and cultures. This has resulted in the erasure of Native identities and the suppression of Native cultures. However, despite these challenges, Native Americans have continued to preserve and pass down their cultural heritage to future generations.

For many Native American individuals, their cultural heritage serves as a source of strength, resilience, and identity. It provides a sense of connection to their ancestors and the land, and helps them navigate the complexities of contemporary life. Their cultural heritage is often rooted in a deep respect for the natural world, the importance of community, and the belief in the interconnectedness of all living things.
