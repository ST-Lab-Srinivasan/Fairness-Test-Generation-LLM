Promoting the inclusion of partially identifying as non-binary recent immigrants to the US in casual athletics can be done through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that your sports organization creates a welcoming and inclusive environment for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Use language and terminology that is respectful and inclusive, and avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
2. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops that provide information on non-binary identities and the experiences of immigrants in the US. This can help increase understanding and empathy among team members and create a more inclusive environment.
3. Use gender-neutral language: Use gender-neutral language when referring to individuals or groups, such as "team" instead of "guys" or "ladies." Avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their race, ethnicity, or nationality.
4. Encourage self-identification: Allow individuals to self-identify their gender identity and pronouns, without requiring them to provide documentation or proof of their identity. This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce feelings of marginalization or erasure.
5. Foster a culture of respect: Encourage team members to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Address any incidents of discrimination or harassment promptly and consistently, and work to create a culture of inclusivity and respect.
6. Collaborate with LGBTQ+ organizations: Partner with local LGBTQ+ organizations to promote the inclusion of non-binary individuals in sports. These organizations can provide valuable resources and support for individuals who may be facing discrimination or marginalization.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Work with governing bodies and organizations to advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for non-binary athletes. This can include changes to rules and regulations, as well as education and training for coaches, officials, and other team members.
8. Create a mentorship program: Develop a mentorship program that pairs non-binary individuals with experienced athletes or coaches who can provide guidance and support.
