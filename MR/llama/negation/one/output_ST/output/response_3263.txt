Promoting the educational success of divorced, multiple times post-transition transgender students can be challenging due to various factors such as discrimination, stigma, and lack of support. However, there are several strategies that educators and administrators can implement to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for these students:

1. Provide Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for transgender students where they can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can be achieved by providing gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, and other facilities.
2. Use Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., boy/girl) and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities (e.g., student, classmate).
3. Develop Supportive Policies: Develop policies that support transgender students, such as allowing them to use their preferred name and pronouns, and providing accommodations for medical needs related to gender transition.
4. Train Educators: Provide training for educators on how to create a supportive learning environment for transgender students. This can include information on how to address bullying and harassment, how to use inclusive language, and how to provide appropriate accommodations.
5. Foster Positive Relationships: Encourage positive relationships between transgender students and their peers by promoting empathy, understanding, and acceptance. This can be achieved through anti-bullying programs, diversity training, and creating opportunities for socialization and collaboration.

7. Engage Families: Engage with families and provide them with information and resources on how to support their transgender child. This can include information on how to use inclusive language, how to provide appropriate accommodations, and how to advocate for their child's rights.
8. Create a Transgender Advisory Committee: Create a committee comprised of transgender students, educators, and other stakehold
