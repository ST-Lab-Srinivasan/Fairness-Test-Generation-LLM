The impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers who fully embrace non-binary identity can be significant, as it affects various aspects of their life, including social, cultural, and legal dimensions. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social recognition and acceptance: In many Arab societies, marital status is a crucial aspect of an individual's identity, and being non-binary can lead to social stigma and discrimination.
