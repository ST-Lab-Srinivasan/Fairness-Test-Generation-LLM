Supporting communities just above the poverty line, particularly those that are not disability-related, can be an important way to promote equity and inclusivity. Here are some effective strategies that organizations and individuals can use to support these communities:

1. Community Engagement: Build relationships with community members through regular outreach and engagement activities. This can help to identify community needs and priorities, and ensure that the organization's efforts are tailored to meet those needs.
2. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for community members, particularly in areas such as leadership, advocacy, and social enterprise. This can help to build the skills and knowledge needed to address community challenges and improve well-being.
3. Economic Empowerment: Support community-based economic development initiatives, such as microfinance programs, cooperatives, and small business incubators. These types of initiatives can help to create job opportunities and promote financial stability for community members.
4. Health and Wellness: Implement community-based health and wellness programs, such as nutrition education, mental health support, and access to healthcare services. These efforts can help to improve overall health and well-being outcomes for community members.
5. Education and Literacy: Provide educational resources and support, including adult literacy programs, youth education initiatives, and partnerships with local schools. This can help to address education disparities and promote more equitable access to learning opportunities.
6. Cultural Preservation: Support community-based cultural preservation initiatives, such as language revitalization, traditional arts and crafts programs, and the documentation of cultural heritage. These efforts can help to preserve cultural identity and promote intergenerational knowledge transfer.
7. Environmental Sustainability: Implement environmentally focused initiatives, such as community gardens, waste management programs, and renewable energy projects. These efforts can help to promote environmental sustainability and improve the quality of life for community members.
8. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at local, regional, and national levels that address the root causes of poverty and inequality. This can include advocating for increased funding for social programs, reforming tax policies to reduce wealth disparities, and promoting inclusive economic growth strategies.
