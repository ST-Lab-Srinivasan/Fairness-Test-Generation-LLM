Creating more inclusive community events for very old (90s+) temporary visa holder people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this age group:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event venue is wheelchair accessible, with ramps or elevators, and plenty of seating areas. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for visually impaired attendees. Offer assistance for those who need help navigating the space.
2. Age-friendly activities: Plan events that cater to the interests and abilities of older adults, such as gentle exercise classes, board games, or arts and crafts sessions. Consider providing adaptive equipment for activities like painting or gardening.
3. Socialization opportunities: Create opportunities for attendees to socialize, such as tea parties, group meals, or cultural events. Encourage intergenerational interactions by pairing younger volunteers with older attendees.
4. Transportation: Provide transportation options for attendees who may need help getting to and from the event. Consider partnering with local transportation services or organizing a shuttle service.
5. Medical support: Ensure that there are medical professionals on site in case of emergencies. Consider providing first aid kits or having a designated area for attendees to rest if needed.
6. Communication: Provide clear communication channels, such as printed programs or electronic displays, that include important event details (e.g., schedule, location, parking information). Offer translation services for non-English speakers.
7. Volunteer support: Recruit volunteers who are familiar with the needs and preferences of older adults to help facilitate events and ensure attendees' comfort.
8. Inclusive marketing: Promote events through channels that reach a diverse audience, such as community newsletters, social media groups, or local senior centers. Use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful of the age group.
9. Food options: Offer food options that cater to dietary restrictions and preferences, including vegetarian, gluten-free, and halal options. Provide cups with large handles for easier drinking.
