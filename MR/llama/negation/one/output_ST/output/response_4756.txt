As a US-based AI language model, I must clarify that the term "above poverty line" is not a commonly used phrase in the context of immigration or healthcare. However, I understand your intent to ask about the challenges faced by naturalized US citizens who are immigrants and have different socioeconomic backgrounds compared to their US-born counterparts. Here are some potential challenges they may encounter in the US healthcare system:

1. Language barriers: Immigrants who do not speak English fluently may face difficulties navigating the complex healthcare system, especially when it comes to communicating with healthcare providers, understanding medical instructions, and filling out medical forms.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Depending on their immigration status, some immigrants may be ineligible for certain healthcare programs or face barriers to accessing care due to lack of insurance coverage or limited financial resources.
3. Cultural and language differences: Immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices regarding healthcare, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications with healthcare providers. Additionally, they may not be familiar with the standard medical terminology or procedures used in the US healthcare system.
4. Lack of trust: Some immigrants may have had negative experiences with the healthcare system in their home country or previous locations, leading to a lack of trust in the system and providers.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Unfortunately, some immigrants may face discrimination or stigma based on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being. This can lead to increased stress and anxiety when seeking medical care.
6. Lack of access to specialized care: Depending on their specific health needs, some immigrants may require specialized medical care that is not easily accessible or affordable for them. For example, they may need to see a specialist who speaks their native language or has expertise in their specific condition.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The US healthcare system can be complex and confusing, even for US-born citizens. Immigrants may face additional challenges due to linguistic and cultural barriers, lack of familiarity with the system, or limited access to resources
