1. Culturally adapted materials: Develop culturally adapted materials, such as pamphlets, videos, or social media content, that address the specific needs and concerns of ethnically full Asian communities during the postpartum period. These materials should be designed in a way that is respectful and sensitive to the community's cultural beliefs and practices.
