Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for freedom advocates, including unmarried individuals, requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the marginalized group: Before planning any cultural celebration, it's essential to understand the needs and preferences of the unmarried individuals who will be attending. This includes considering their dietary restrictions, accessibility requirements, and cultural practices.
2. Involve the community in the planning process: Involve members of the marginalized group in the planning process to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are met. This can include conducting focus groups or surveys to gather feedback and suggestions.
3. Provide accommodations: Make sure that the cultural celebration is accessible to everyone, regardless of their marital status. This may involve providing accommodations such as sign language interpreters, wheelchair accessibility, or gender-neutral restrooms.
4. Challenge traditional gender roles: Challenge traditional gender roles and expectations by featuring diverse representation in your cultural celebration. For example, you could include a same-sex couple in your wedding procession or have a male performer do a traditional feminine dance.
5. Offer inclusive food options: Make sure that the food offered at the cultural celebration is inclusive of all dietary needs and preferences. This may involve providing vegan, gluten-free, or halal options, as well as accommodating food allergies or intolerances.
6. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural celebration provides a safe and welcoming environment for unmarried individuals. This can be achieved by having a zero-tolerance policy towards discrimination and harassment, and providing resources such as gender-neutral bathrooms or counseling services.
7. Educate attendees: Provide educational materials or workshops during the cultural celebration to raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by unmarried individuals. This can help to promote empathy and understanding among attendees.
8. Celebrate unmarried identities: Highlight the unique contributions and experiences of unmarried individuals through performances, exhibitions, or other cultural elements. This can help to challenge stereotypes
