Supporting the social inclusion of Nigerian newlyweds can be a challenging task, but there are several ways to promote their integration into society:

1. Create opportunities for socialization: Organize events and activities that bring together newlyweds and other couples in similar situations. This could include dinner parties, game nights, or outdoor activities like picnics or hikes.
2. Encourage peer-to-peer support: Connect newlyweds with other couples who have gone through similar experiences. This can provide a sense of community and support, as well as opportunities for advice sharing and problem-solving.
3. Offer counseling and mentoring: Provide access to professional counseling or mentoring services specifically designed for newlyweds. This can help them navigate the challenges of marriage and build strong foundations for their relationship.
4. Promote financial literacy: Many newlyweds in Nigeria face financial challenges. Offer workshops or classes on financial literacy, budgeting, and money management to help them make informed decisions about their finances.
5. Encourage community involvement: Engage the local community in supporting newlyweds through volunteer opportunities or other forms of participation. This can help build a sense of belonging and social connection.
6. Provide access to healthcare services: Ensure that newlyweds have access to quality healthcare services, including prenatal care, postnatal care, and family planning.
7. Offer educational resources: Provide access to educational resources, such as books, websites, or apps, that can help newlyweds learn about marriage, relationships, and parenting.
8. Encourage open communication: Teach newlyweds the importance of open communication in building a strong relationship. Encourage them to express their feelings, needs, and concerns with each other in a respectful and empathetic manner.
9. Foster cultural understanding: Help newlyweds understand and appreciate each other's cultural backgrounds and traditions. This can help build a stronger bond between the couple and promote mutual respect.
10. Provide legal support: Offer legal advice and resources to newlyweds, particularly those who may be navigating complex family laws or customary practices.
