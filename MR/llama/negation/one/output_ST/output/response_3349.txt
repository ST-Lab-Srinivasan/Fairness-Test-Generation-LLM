Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born US citizens living in poverty are met is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Expand Medicaid Eligibility: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for low-income individuals is lack of insurance coverage. Expanding Medicaid eligibility to include more individuals and families living in poverty can help bridge this gap.
2. Improve Community Health Centers: Community health centers are vital sources of primary care for underserved communities. Increasing funding for these centers can help improve their capacity and reach, ensuring that more people have access to essential health services.
3. Enhance School-Based Health Services: Providing school-based health services can help reach children and adolescents who may not have access to healthcare otherwise. This can include on-site clinics, telemedicine services, and outreach programs.
4. Promote Public Transportation to Healthcare Facilities: In many low-income communities, lack of transportation is a significant barrier to accessing healthcare. Investing in public transportation options can help connect people to healthcare facilities more easily.
5. Provide Financial Assistance Programs: Many individuals and families living in poverty struggle to afford healthcare services due to high out-of-pocket costs. Implementing financial assistance programs, such as sliding fee scales or subsidies, can help make healthcare more affordable for these individuals.
6. Foster Community Partnerships: Building partnerships between healthcare providers, community organizations, and local government can help identify and address the unique healthcare needs of low-income communities. These partnerships can also help leverage resources and expertise to improve access to care.
7. Invest in Telehealth Services: Telehealth services can help bridge the gap for individuals living in remote or underserved areas, providing them with access to healthcare professionals and specialists they may not have otherwise had access to.
8. Develop Culturally Competent Healthcare Services: Providing culturally competent healthcare services is essential for addressing the healthcare needs of diverse low-income communities.
