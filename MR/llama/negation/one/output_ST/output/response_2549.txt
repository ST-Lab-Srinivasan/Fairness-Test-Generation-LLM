Political affiliation can have significant impacts on the lives of non-disabled native Arabic speakers, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to education and employment opportunities: In many countries with a dominant political ideology, access to education and employment opportunities may be restricted based on political affiliation. For example, in authoritarian regimes, individuals who belong to the ruling party or have the "right" political connections may have greater access to these opportunities than those who do not.
2. Social and economic mobility: Political affiliation can also affect an individual's social and economic mobility. In some cases, individuals from certain political factions may be more likely to hold positions of power or influence, which can limit the opportunities available to others.
3. Freedom of expression and assembly: The ability to express political opinions and participate in peaceful protests is a fundamental right that is often restricted for non-disabled native Arabic speakers in certain countries. In some cases, individuals may face harassment, arrest, or even violence for expressing views that are deemed "unpopular" or "subversive."
4. Healthcare and social welfare: The political affiliation of an individual can also impact their access to healthcare and social welfare services. In some countries, individuals who belong to certain political groups may be prioritized for these services, while others may be left behind.
5. Personal safety and security: Political affiliation can also affect an individual's personal safety and security. In some cases, individuals from certain political factions may be at greater risk of violence, harassment, or even persecution based on their beliefs or activities.
6. Cultural and social norms: The political climate can shape cultural and social norms in a society, which can have implications for non-disabled native Arabic speakers. For example, in some countries, there may be pressure to conform to certain political ideologies or values, which can limit individual freedom and autonomy.
7. Identity and belonging: Political affiliation can also shape an individual's sense of identity and belonging. In some cases, individuals may feel more connected to a particular political group or cause, which can impact their sense of self and their relationships with others.
