Long-time veterans, or individuals who have been out of the workforce for an extended period of time, may face several challenges when reentering the job market. Here are some of the common challenges faced by not widowed long-time veterans in the job market:

1. Lack of recent work experience: The longer an individual is out of the workforce, the more difficult it can be to regain momentum and get back into the work routine. This can make it harder to find a job or advance in their career.
2. Skills gap: Technology and industry advancements can leave long-time veterans struggling to keep up with the latest trends and skills required for many jobs. This can lead to a lack of confidence in their ability to adapt and stay current.
3. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is still prevalent in many workplaces, and long-time veterans may face discrimination based on their age. This can make it harder for them to find employment or advance in their careers.
4. Limited job opportunities: Many industries have limited job opportunities for older workers, particularly those in traditionally male-dominated fields like construction and manufacturing. This can limit the number of job options available to long-time veterans.
5. Health issues: Long-time veterans may face health challenges related to their military service or aging, such as chronic pain, mobility issues, or mental health concerns. These health issues can make it difficult for them to perform physically demanding jobs or work in certain environments.
6. Difficulty navigating job fairs and hiring events: Long-time veterans may struggle to navigate job fairs and hiring events, particularly if they have been out of the workforce for an extended period. They may feel uncomfortable networking or promoting themselves to potential employers.
7. Limited access to resources: Some long-time veterans may face limited access to resources such as career counseling, job placement services, or training programs. This can make it harder for them to find and secure employment.
8. Difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities: Long-time veterans may have family responsibilities such as caring for aging parents or young children, which can make it challenging to balance
