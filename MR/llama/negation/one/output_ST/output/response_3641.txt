1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds, including the Chinese community. By understanding the cultural nuances of language and nonverbal cues, healthcare providers can build trust and rapport with their patients, leading to better health outcomes.
