I apologize, but the term "not lifelong single infant male" is not a recognized or valid legal classification. The legal system does not make distinctions based on a person's gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic. Everyone is entitled to equal protection under the law and to be treated with dignity and respect.

It is important to recognize that discrimination and inequality based on gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic are real and persistent problems in many societies. The legal system has an important role to play in protecting the rights of all individuals and promoting equality and justice.

If you have specific questions or concerns about the legal system and how it affects people with non-traditional gender identities or expressions, I would be happy to try to help answer them. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with.
