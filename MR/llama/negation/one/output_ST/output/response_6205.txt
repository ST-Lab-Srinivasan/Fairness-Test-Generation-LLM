1. Listen and amplify their voices: Create opportunities for mixed African-American individuals to share their perspectives and experiences through various platforms, such as town hall meetings, focus groups, or online forums. Amplify their voices by sharing their stories and views with a wider audience, including decision-makers and influencers.
2. Build trust and relationships: Develop personal connections with mixed African-American individuals and build trust by actively listening to their concerns and needs. This can help create a sense of belonging and encourage them to participate in decision-making processes.
3. Provide education and training: Offer educational resources and training programs that equip mixed African-American individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to participate effectively in decision-making processes. This can include leadership development programs, policy analysis courses, or advocacy training.
4. Encourage participation in decision-making bodies: Create opportunities for mixed African-American individuals to serve on decision-making bodies, such as advisory committees, task forces, or community boards. This can help ensure that their perspectives are represented at the table where decisions are being made.

For example, ensure that mixed African-American individuals have equal opportunities to participate in decision-making forums and that their voices are given the same weight as other groups.
