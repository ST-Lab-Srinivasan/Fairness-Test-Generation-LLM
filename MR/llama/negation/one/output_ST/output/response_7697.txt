Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals with no known genetic conditions in upper, lower, or middle-income countries can be achieved through a multifaceted approach that addresses various aspects of accessibility, affordability, and cultural sensitivity. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive community programs:

1. Needs assessment: Conduct thorough needs assessments to identify the specific requirements of the target population, including their cultural background, language proficiency, and access to healthcare services. This will help tailor the program to meet the unique needs of each group.
