Supporting the social inclusion of actively partially identifying as non-binary and strictly partly asexual individuals requires acknowledging and respecting their identities. Here are some ways to promote inclusivity:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences, challenges, and terminology associated with non-binary and asexual identities. This will help you understand and empathize with these communities.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using binary gender language (e.g., "guys," "boys") and instead use gender-neutral terms (e.g., "everyone," "people"). When referring to someone's identity, ask them how they prefer to be referred to.
3. Be mindful of assumptions: Don't assume someone's gender or sexuality based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask them how they identify and respect their self-identification.
4. Create safe spaces: Host events or create online communities that are inclusive and welcoming for non-binary and asexual individuals. Ensure these spaces are free from discrimination and harassment.
5. Support advocacy efforts: Follow organizations and advocates dedicated to advancing the rights and visibility of non-binary and asexual individuals. Show your support by sharing their content, attending events, or donating to their causes.
6. Listen and amplify: Listen to the experiences and voices of non-binary and asexual individuals, and amplify them in your communities. Share their stories, art, and perspectives to help promote understanding and acceptance.
7. Respect boundaries: Respect people's privacy and personal space, especially when it comes to discussing their gender identity or sexuality. Avoid asking intrusive questions or pressuring someone to disclose more than they're comfortable sharing.
8. Foster allyship: Be an active ally by speaking up against discrimination and harassment, and supporting non-binary and asexual individuals in your communities.
9. Create visibility: Help create visibility for non-binary and asexual individuals by promoting their work, art, and perspectives in your networks. Encourage representation in media, literature, and other areas where non-binary and asexual individuals are underrepresented or misrepresent
