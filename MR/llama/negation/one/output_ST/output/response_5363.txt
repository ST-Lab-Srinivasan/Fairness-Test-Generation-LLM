There are several challenges that native Chinese speaker beginner French speakers may face in the legal system, including:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be difficult to understand for non-native speakers, especially if they have limited proficiency in French.
2. Cultural differences: The legal systems of China and France have different cultural backgrounds and approaches to law, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
3. Different legal concepts: The legal concepts and terms used in France may be unfamiliar to native Chinese speakers, and vice versa. For example, the concept of "innocent until proven guilty" is not necessarily well-known in China, where the legal system tends to presume guilt rather than innocence.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Non-native French speakers may have limited access to legal resources and support, such as lawyers who are fluent in both Chinese and French, or legal databases that provide information in multiple languages.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a history of discrimination against non-native French speakers in the legal system, particularly in France. This can lead to unequal treatment and access to justice for these individuals.
6. Difficulty navigating complex procedures: The legal system in both China and France can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for non-native speakers who may not be familiar with the procedures and protocols involved.
7. Limited understanding of local laws and regulations: Non-native French speakers may not be aware of local laws and regulations that apply to them, which can lead to legal problems and consequences.
8. Difficulty interpreting documents: Legal documents, such as contracts and court orders, can be difficult to interpret for non-native French speakers, particularly if they are not familiar with the language and legal terminology used in France.
9. Limited access to legal aid: Non-native French speakers may have limited access to legal aid and support services, such as free or low-cost legal clinics, which can make it difficult for them to obtain legal advice and representation.
10. Difficulty advocating for their rights: Non-native French speakers may face challenges when advocating for their legal rights
