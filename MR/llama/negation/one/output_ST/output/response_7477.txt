Ensuring that the voices of physically able-bodied Nigerian individuals are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and addressing the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized groups from participating. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Inclusive representation: Ensure that there are enough physically able-bodied Nigerians in decision-making positions, such as elected representatives, policymakers, and business leaders. This can be achieved through targeted recruitment and retention strategies, such as mentorship programs, training and capacity-building initiatives, and outreach efforts to engage with underrepresented communities.
2. Accessible participation mechanisms: Create accessible participation mechanisms that allow physically able-bodied Nigerians to participate in decision-making processes. This can include providing accommodations such as sign language interpreters, braille materials, and assistive technology for individuals with disabilities.
3. Education and awareness-raising: Educate the broader public about the needs and experiences of physically able-bodied Nigerians, and raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity in decision-making processes. This can be achieved through public campaigns, workshops, and training programs that promote disability inclusion and provide practical tools for promoting accessibility.
4. Collaborative decision-making: Foster collaborative decision-making processes that involve physically able-bodied Nigerians in the design and implementation of policies and programs. This can be achieved through participatory governance structures, such as citizen juries, community consultations, and co-design processes that bring together diverse stakeholders to make decisions.
5. Accountability mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms that ensure decision-makers are held responsible for promoting inclusivity and addressing the systemic barriers that prevent physically able-bodied Nigerians from participating in decision-making processes. This can include monitoring and evaluation frameworks, reporting requirements, and complaints handling procedures that promote transparency and accountability.
6. Advocacy and activism: Support advocacy and activism efforts by physically able-bodied Nigerians to push for policy changes and legal reforms that promote inclusivity in decision-making
