The marital status of a parent can have significant impacts on the life of a natural-born US citizen child. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Security Benefits: If a parent is not married, their child may be eligible for Social Security benefits based on their own record. This can provide financial support for the child in the event of the parent's death or disability.
2. Health Insurance: Children born to unmarried parents may be eligible for health insurance through their mother's plan, particularly if she has a job that offers coverage. However, if the father is not listed on the birth certificate, he may not have access to his own health insurance or the ability to add the child to his plan.
