Supporting the professional aspirations of a spouse who is struggling financially can be challenging, but there are several ways you can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer emotional support: Listen to your spouse's concerns and frustrations without judgment. Validate their feelings and offer words of encouragement. Remind them that they are not alone in their struggles and that you are there to support them.
