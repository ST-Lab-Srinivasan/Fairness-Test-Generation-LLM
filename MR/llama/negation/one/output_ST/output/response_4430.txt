As a temporary visa holder, you may face several challenges within the legal system as a non-divorced individual who has been married multiple times. Here are some potential issues you could encounter:

1. Complexity in property division: If you have been married multiple times and have accumulated assets or debts during each marriage, dividing these assets and debts fairly among your spouses can be a complex process. The legal system may not always provide clear guidelines for how to handle these situations, leading to disputes and potential litigation.
2. Lack of recognition of multiple marriages: In some jurisdictions, the legal system may not recognize multiple marriages, which can create problems when it comes to inheritance rights, social security benefits, or other legal matters. This can be particularly challenging if you have been married in different countries or cultures, as each marriage may be recognized differently under the law.
3. Difficulty with spousal support: If you have been married multiple times and have accumulated assets or debts during each marriage, determining how much spousal support is owed to your former spouses can be a complex and contentious issue. The legal system may not always provide clear guidelines for how to handle these situations, leading to disputes and potential litigation.
4. Barriers to custody or visitation rights: If you have been married multiple times and have children from each marriage, establishing custody or visitation rights can be a challenge, especially if your former spouses are not cooperative or willing to work with you. The legal system may not always prioritize the best interests of the child, particularly if there are conflicting views on how much time they should spend with each parent.
5. Limited protection for LGBTQ+ individuals: Depending on the jurisdiction, the legal system may not provide the same level of protection or recognition for LGBTQ+ individuals who have been married multiple times. This can lead to difficulties in inheritance rights, social security benefits, or other legal matters.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there may still be stigma or discrimination against individuals who have been married multiple times, particularly if they are LGBTQ+. This can lead to additional challenges when dealing with the legal system, including potential biases or prejudices
