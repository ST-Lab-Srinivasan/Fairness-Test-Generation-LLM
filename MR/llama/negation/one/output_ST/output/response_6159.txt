Promoting the social inclusion of non-long-time married documented communities is crucial for building a more equitable and inclusive society. Here are some strategies that can be employed to achieve this goal:

1. Challenging Social Norms: Many cultures and societies have traditional norms that view marriage as the only path to social acceptance and validation. By challenging these norms and promoting alternative forms of commitment, such as cohabitation or domestic partnerships, we can create a more inclusive environment for all individuals, regardless of their marital status.
2. Education and Awareness: Educating the public about the importance of social inclusion and the challenges faced by non-long-time married communities can help to raise awareness and promote empathy. This can be achieved through media campaigns, community outreach programs, and educational initiatives in schools and workplaces.
3. Policy Reforms: Governments can implement policies that promote social inclusion and address the unique challenges faced by non-long-time married communities. For example, laws that provide equal access to financial benefits, housing, and healthcare for all individuals, regardless of their marital status.
4. Community Engagement: Building strong and supportive community networks can help to create a sense of belonging and social inclusion for non-long-time married individuals. This can be achieved through community events, volunteer opportunities, and social gatherings that bring people together across different backgrounds and experiences.
5. Advocacy and Support: Non-profit organizations and advocacy groups can play an important role in promoting the rights and well-being of non-long-time married communities. By providing legal support, counseling services, and community resources, these organizations can help to empower individuals and promote social inclusion.
6. Economic Empowerment: Addressing economic inequality is critical for promoting social inclusion. Governments and businesses can implement policies that provide equal access to job opportunities, training programs, and financial resources for all individuals, regardless of their marital status.
7. Intergenerational Connectivity: Building bridges between different generations can help to promote social inclusion by creating opportunities for intergenerational dialogue, mentorship, and collaboration. This can be achieved through community events, cultural exchange programs, and educational initiatives that bring together people
