Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-divorced individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals with different abilities, cultures, and experiences. This will help create a more inclusive event that caters to a diverse audience.
2. Provide accessible venues and activities: Choose venues that are wheelchair-accessible and offer activities that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of their abilities. For example, instead of having a dance party, consider hosting a music workshop where participants can learn how to play musical instruments or create their own songs.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that perpetuates ableism or discrimination against any particular group. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their abilities.
4. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities, such as sign language interpreters, wheelchair accessibility, and Braille materials. Ensure that these accommodations are easily accessible and well-advertised.
5. Incorporate representation: Make sure that the event includes representation from diverse cultures and communities. This can be achieved by featuring performers, artists, and speakers from different backgrounds and identities.
6. Foster inclusive atmosphere: Create an atmosphere that is welcoming and inclusive to all participants. Encourage everyone to participate and engage in the celebration, regardless of their abilities.
7. Provide sensory-friendly activities: Offer activities that are sensitive to the needs of individuals with sensory processing disorders or other neurodiverse conditions. This can include providing quiet areas for those who need a break from the noise, or offering activities that are specifically designed for individuals with these needs.
8. Collaborate with disability organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to ensure that the event is accessible and inclusive for all participants. These organizations can provide valuable input on how to make the event more inclusive and enjoyable for everyone.
9. Offer inclusive food options: Provide a variety of food options that cater to different dietary needs, such as gluten-free, vegan, and halal.
