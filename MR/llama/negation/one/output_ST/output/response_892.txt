Introduction:
Marriage and pregnancy are significant life events that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. Recently, there has been an influx of immigrants to Canada, many of whom are experiencing early pregnancy. However, the impact of marital status on these individuals is not well understood. This study aims to investigate the effects of marital status on the lives of recently immigrated individuals in their first trimester of pregnancy in Canada.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic well-being (1,2). However, there is limited research on the specific experiences of recently immigrated individuals in their first trimester of pregnancy.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 100 recently immigrated women who are in their first trimester of pregnancy in Canada. Participants will be recruited through community health centers, hospitals, and immigrant organizations. Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, and focus groups.

Quantitative Data:
The survey will include questions on demographics, marital status, pregnancy experience, and stress levels. The survey will also assess the participants' knowledge of prenatal care and access to healthcare services in Canada.

Qualitative Data:
Interviews and focus groups will be conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the participants' experiences with early pregnancy as recently immigrated individuals. The interviews and focus groups will explore themes such as social support, cultural practices and beliefs, access to healthcare services, and stress levels.

Analysis:
The quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistical methods, such as chi-square tests and linear regression. The qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis and coding schemes.

Expected Outcomes:
This study aims to identify the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently immigrated individuals in their first trimester of pregnancy in Canada. Specifically, we expect to find that recently immigrated women who are married or
