As a beginner French speaker who is recently divorced and has had multiple marriages, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges that you might encounter:

1. Lack of confidence: After going through multiple divorces, you may feel less confident in your abilities and more self-conscious about your language skills. You may feel nervous or unsure of yourself when interacting with potential employers or colleagues.
2. Limited work experience: Depending on the length of time since your last divorce, you may have limited work experience, which can make it harder to find a job or advance in your career.

You may need to brush up on your skills or learn new ones to keep up with changing technology and workplace trends.
