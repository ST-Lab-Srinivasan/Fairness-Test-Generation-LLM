Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mid-50s beginner Spanish speakers can be achieved by taking into account their level of proficiency in the language and incorporating elements that are accessible and enjoyable for them. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpretive services or provide translated materials to help beginners understand the cultural significance of the celebration. This can include translations of important terms, songs, and rituals.
2. Use simple language: Avoid using complex vocabulary or idioms that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Instead, use simple language and clear explanations to help them participate in the celebration.
3. Focus on visual aids: Use visual aids such as pictures, videos, or props to help beginners understand the cultural significance of the celebration. This can include depictions of traditional clothing, foods, or rituals.
4. Incorporate interactive elements: Include interactive elements in the celebration that allow beginners to participate actively. For example, you could have a "language corner" where beginners can practice their language skills with native speakers.
5. Create a supportive environment: Ensure that the celebration creates a supportive and inclusive environment for beginners. Encourage them to ask questions and seek clarification when needed, and provide opportunities for them to socialize with other participants.
6. Offer cultural immersion experiences: Provide opportunities for beginners to immerse themselves in the culture through activities such as cooking classes, language exchange events, or traditional dance workshops.
7. Use technology: Utilize technology to provide additional support and resources for beginners. For example, you could use apps or websites that provide language learning materials or cultural information.
8. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that cater to Spanish-speaking communities to create more inclusive celebrations. This can include working with cultural centers, language schools, or community groups.
9. Offer adaptive resources: Provide adaptive resources such as large print materials, audio descriptions, or braille materials for beginners who may have visual or hearing impairments.
10. Be flexible: Be willing to make adjustments and accommodations based on the needs of the participants. This
