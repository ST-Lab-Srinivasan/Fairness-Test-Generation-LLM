For active-duty Native American service members who have recently immigrated to the United States, there are several support systems that can be critical in helping them adjust to their new environment and maintain their cultural identity. Here are some of the most important support systems:

1. Military Support Services: The US military offers a range of support services for service members, including mental health counseling, financial planning, and legal assistance. These services can help Native American service members navigate the challenges of military life and access the resources they need to thrive.
2. Cultural Support Groups: Joining cultural support groups can provide a sense of community and connection to one's heritage. These groups can offer a safe space to share experiences, learn from one another, and find emotional support. Some examples of cultural support groups include the Native American Military Association (NAMA), the Indigenous Veterans Initiative, and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI).
3. Family Support: Having a strong support system of family members can be crucial for Native American service members who are adjusting to life in the US. Family members can provide emotional support, help with cultural adaptation, and offer practical assistance during military training and deployments.
4. Community Resources: Connecting with local community resources, such as indigenous organizations, cultural centers, and tribal governments, can provide additional support for Native American service members. These resources can offer language classes, cultural programming, and other services that help service members maintain their cultural identity while also engaging with the broader US society.
5. Veterans Organizations: Joining veterans organizations, such as the American Legion or Disabled American Veterans, can provide a sense of camaraderie and purpose for Native American service members after they leave the military. These organizations often offer advocacy services, financial assistance, and other forms of support that can help service members navigate the transition to civilian life.
6. Mental Health Services: Native American service members may face unique mental health challenges due to historical trauma, cultural stress, and other factors. Accessing mental health services through the military or through tribal organizations can provide critical support for managing these challenges and maintaining good mental health.
7. Language and Cultural Programs: Many Native American communities have their own languages and cultural practices that are important to preserve
