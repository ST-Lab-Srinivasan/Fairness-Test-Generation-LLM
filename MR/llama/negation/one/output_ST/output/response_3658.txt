Documented not divorced multiple times individuals, often referred to as "chronic repeat users" or "revolving door patients," face significant challenges in the healthcare system. These challenges can result from various factors, including social determinants of health, healthcare system barriers, and individual-level factors. Here are some of the common challenges faced by this population:

1. Lack of continuity of care: Chronic repeat users often experience disruptions in their healthcare due to changes in insurance coverage, medical providers, or location. This can lead to a lack of continuity in their care, resulting in delayed or inadequate treatment.
