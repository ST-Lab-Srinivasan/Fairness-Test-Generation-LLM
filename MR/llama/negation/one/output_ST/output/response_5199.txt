Ensuring that the healthcare needs of marginalized communities, including those living in poverty in Mexico, are met is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: Many people in rural and impoverished areas of Mexico lack access to basic healthcare services due to distance, cost, or lack of infrastructure. Efforts should be made to increase the availability of healthcare facilities, especially in these areas, by building new clinics or hospitals, or by providing mobile healthcare units.
2. Improve the quality of care: The quality of healthcare services can vary greatly across Mexico, with many rural areas lacking access to specialized care. Efforts should be made to improve the quality of care in these areas by training healthcare professionals, investing in equipment and technology, and promoting evidence-based practices.
3. Address social determinants of health: Many factors outside of the direct provision of healthcare services can impact an individual's ability to access and utilize healthcare. Efforts should be made to address these social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, housing, and transportation, which can affect a person's overall health and well-being.
4. Promote community engagement: Community engagement and participation are critical to ensuring that the healthcare needs of marginalized communities are met. Efforts should be made to involve local communities in the planning and delivery of healthcare services, including through the use of community health workers and other lay healthworkers.
5. Strengthen policy and governance: Strong policies and effective governance are essential to ensuring that healthcare services are accessible and equitable. Efforts should be made to strengthen policy and governance structures at the national, state, and local levels to promote greater accountability, transparency, and responsiveness to the needs of marginalized communities.
6. Address discrimination and stigma: Discrimination and stigma can affect the health and well-being of marginalized communities, including those living in poverty in Mexico. Efforts should be made to address these issues through promoting cultural competence and respect for diversity among healthcare providers
