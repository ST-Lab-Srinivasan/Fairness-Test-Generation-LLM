Ensuring the educational needs of ex-military Native American natural-born US citizens require a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies to help meet their educational needs:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for educators on cultural competency and sensitivity towards Native American students. This can help create a more inclusive learning environment and reduce the risk of cultural insensitivity or discrimination.
2. Access to Tribal Resources: Collaborate with local tribal organizations to provide access to resources such as language and cultural programs, mental health services, and academic support. This can help address the unique challenges faced by Native American students and promote their overall well-being.
3. Incorporating Traditional Knowledge: Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum, where appropriate. This can help Native American students feel more connected to their culture and identity while also providing a more holistic learning experience.
4. Mentorship and Leadership Opportunities: Provide opportunities for Native American students to take on leadership roles or mentor younger students. This can help develop their confidence, skills, and sense of purpose.
5. Community Involvement: Encourage community involvement in educational programs by partnering with local organizations, hosting cultural events, or providing opportunities for community members to share their knowledge and experiences.
6. Support Services: Provide support services such as tutoring, academic advising, and counseling to help Native American students succeed academically and personally.
7. Collaboration with Tribal Colleges: Establish partnerships with tribal colleges and universities to provide educational opportunities for Native American students. These institutions often have a deeper understanding of the cultural and academic needs of Native American students.
8. Curriculum Reforms: Reform curricula to better reflect the experiences, histories, and cultures of Native American communities. This can include incorporating indigenous perspectives, knowledge, and practices into the curriculum.
9. Teacher Professional Development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for educators to learn about Native American cultures, histories, and experiences. This can help improve teaching practices and create a more inclusive learning environment.
