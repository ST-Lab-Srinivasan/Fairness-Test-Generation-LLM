1. Limited access to care: Non-deeply impoverished African Americans may still face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to factors such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited English proficiency.
2. Disparities in quality of care: Research has shown that non-deeply impoverished African Americans may receive lower quality of care compared to their white counterparts, which can lead to poorer health outcomes.
