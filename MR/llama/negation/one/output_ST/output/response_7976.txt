In 1836, ensuring the educational needs of long-time married mentally able-bodied students would have been a relatively straightforward matter compared to today's diverse and complex educational landscape. However, here are some possible strategies that could have been employed to meet their educational needs:

1. Traditional classroom instruction: Providing structured classroom instruction with qualified teachers and curricula tailored to the students' needs and abilities would have been a common approach in 1836. This would have included subjects such as reading, writing, mathematics, science, and history, among others.
2. Vocational training: For married students who were mentally able-bodied but had different career aspirations, vocational training could have been provided to equip them with skills relevant to their chosen fields. This could have included training in areas such as agriculture, craftsmanship, or small business management.
3. Apprenticeships: Another option for educated married students in 1836 would have been apprenticeships, where they could have learned a trade or skill under the guidance of an experienced craftsperson or artisan. This would have provided them with hands-on experience and training in a specific area of expertise.
4. Home schooling: For married students who lived in rural areas or had limited access to formal education, home schooling could have been an alternative option. Parents or guardians could have provided instruction in various subjects, tailored to the students' needs and abilities, within the comfort of their own homes.
5. Community-based learning: In many rural communities, educational opportunities were often shared among members of the community. Married students could have learned from each other, sharing knowledge and skills acquired through daily experiences and observations. This form of community-based learning would have been particularly prevalent in areas where access to formal education was limited.
6. Extension services: In 1836, extension services were often provided by local governments or organizations to reach out to rural communities and provide educational resources. Married students could have benefited from these services, which might have included traveling lecturers, correspondence courses, or other forms of distance learning.
7. Online learning: While the internet was not yet invented in 1836, there were other forms of distance learning
