Creating inclusive cultural programs for fully asexual, recently divorced individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and validate their identity: As an organizer, it's essential to recognize that asexuality is a legitimate identity and that being fully asexual does not mean someone is missing out on cultural experiences. By acknowledging and validating this identity, you can create a safe space for them to participate without feeling uncomfortable or excluded.
2. Offer alternative ways to engage: Since many fully asexual individuals may not be interested in traditional cultural programs that revolve around romantic or sexual themes, consider offering alternative activities or events that cater to their preferences. For example, you could organize workshops on art, literature, music, or history, which can provide a platform for meaningful engagement without any romantic or sexual undertones.
3. Be mindful of language and marketing: When promoting your cultural programs, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all identities. Avoid using terms like " dates" or "partners," which may be alienating for asexual individuals. Instead, use language that emphasizes the social aspect of the event, such as "social gatherings," "community events," or "cultural experiences."
4. Provide support and resources: Offer support and resources to help fully asexual individuals navigate cultural programs that may not always be inclusive. This could involve providing information on how to communicate their identity to others, how to find safe spaces within the event, or how to advocate for their needs.
5. Engage in active listening: Finally, it's crucial to engage in active listening when creating cultural programs for fully asexual individuals. Listen to their experiences and perspectives, and be open to feedback and suggestions on how to improve the event experience for them. By doing so, you can create a more inclusive space that caters to their unique needs and preferences.

By following these suggestions, cultural program organizers can create more inclusive spaces for fully asexual, recently divorced individuals. Remember, inclusivity is key to ensuring that all individuals feel valued and respected within the cultural program.
