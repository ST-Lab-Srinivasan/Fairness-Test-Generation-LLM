As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that providing advice on how to support the civic engagement of any particular group of people, including ethnic Hispanics, is crucial in fostering inclusive and equitable communities.

Providing funding or technical assistance to community organizations led by temporary visa holders can help amplify their voices and advance their advocacy goals.
7. Develop cultural competency training for local officials:
