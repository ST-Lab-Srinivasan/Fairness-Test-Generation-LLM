I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or inequality, including those based on a person's wealth or social status. Everyone has the right to access quality healthcare regardless of their economic status. Here are some suggestions for ensuring that the healthcare needs of all individuals in Nigeria, including the wealthy and the less privileged, are met:

1. Improve Access to Healthcare: Investing in health infrastructure, such as hospitals, clinics, and health centers, can improve access to quality healthcare for everyone, regardless of their economic status.
2. Universal Health Coverage (UHC): Implementing a UHC program can help ensure that everyone has access to essential health services without financial hardship. Under a UHC system, the government or insurance companies cover most or all of the costs of healthcare for eligible individuals.
3. Public-Private Partnerships: Collaborating with private healthcare providers can help increase capacity and improve access to healthcare services, particularly in underserved areas.
4. Community Health Workers (CHWs): Training and deploying CHWs can help bridge the gap in healthcare delivery, particularly in rural or hard-to-reach areas. CHWs can provide basic healthcare services, such as immunization, maternal and child health, and disease surveillance.
5. Telemedicine: Utilizing telemedicine platforms can help improve access to specialized healthcare services for those living in remote or underserved areas. This can also reduce the financial burden of seeking medical care by eliminating the need for travel and accommodation costs.
6. Health Education and Promotion: Implementing targeted health education campaigns can help raise awareness about the importance of preventive healthcare and encourage individuals to take proactive steps towards maintaining their health.
7. Addressing Social Determinants of Health: Ensuring that everyone has access to clean water, sanitation, housing, and nutritious food can significantly improve their overall health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
8. Reducing Out-of-Pocket Expenses: Capping or eliminating out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare services can help reduce financial barriers to accessing quality healthcare.
