Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. In ultra-conservative societies, where traditional gender roles and expectations are prevalent, the impact of marital status on the lives of newly married individuals may be particularly pronounced. This paper examines the impact of marital status on the lives of newly married ultra-conservative individuals in various domains of life, including social, economic, and psychological well-being.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On the one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and social recognition. On the other hand, it can also lead to decreased freedom, increased responsibilities, and potential changes in identity (Komarovsky & Sassler, 2013). In ultra-conservative societies, where gender roles are rigidly defined, the impact of marriage may be more pronounced.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with 20 newly married ultra-conservative individuals in a Middle Eastern country. The participants were selected through purposive sampling, based on their marital status and adherence to ultra-conservative beliefs and practices. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis was used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of newly married ultra-conservative individuals. The following themes emerged from the data:

1. Social Isolation: Many participants reported feeling socially isolated after marriage, as their spouse's family and community became the primary source of social support. This isolation was particularly pronounced for women, who were often excluded from social events and activities by their in-laws.
2. Economic Dependence: The majority of participants reported feeling economically dependent on their spouse, which limited their financial autonomy and independence. This was particularly true for women, who were often expected to prioritize domestic duties over paid employment.
3. Changes in Identity: Many participants reported experiencing changes
