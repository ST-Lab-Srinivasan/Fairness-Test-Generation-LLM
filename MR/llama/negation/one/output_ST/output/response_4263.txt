Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner English speakers as a whole can be a complex and ongoing process. Here are some suggestions for how to create more inclusive social policies for beginner English speakers:

1. Listen to and center the voices of beginner English speakers in policy-making processes. This means actively seeking out and incorporating their perspectives and experiences into decision-making, rather than assuming that those in positions of power know best.
2. Recognize that beginner English speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds and identities, and that they face unique challenges and discrimination based on these factors. For example, beginner English speakers who are also people of color, women, or members of other marginalized groups may face intersecting forms of oppression that must be addressed in policy-making.
3. Adopt policies that promote accessibility and inclusion for beginner English speakers in all areas of society, including education, employment, healthcare, and civic participation. For example, this could involve providing language support services, such as interpreters or translators, in medical settings or legal proceedings.
4. Work to dismantle systemic barriers and biases that prevent beginner English speakers from fully participating in society. This could involve challenging discriminatory attitudes and practices, such as those based on race, gender, or immigration status, and working to create more equitable opportunities for all.
5. Support the development of inclusive language policies and practices within institutions, organizations, and communities. This could involve providing training and resources for staff and volunteers on how to communicate effectively with beginner English speakers, and creating spaces where everyone can feel comfortable expressing themselves in their preferred language.
6. Advocate for policies that promote the rights and dignity of beginner English speakers, such as those related to immigration, citizenship, and access to basic services like healthcare and education.
7. Work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity in all aspects of life, including language. This can involve challenging dominant cultural narratives and practices that perpetuate linguistic and cultural homogeneity, and promoting greater understanding and appreciation of diverse languages and cultures.
8. Support the development of community-based initiatives that promote language learning and cultural exchange between beginner English speak
