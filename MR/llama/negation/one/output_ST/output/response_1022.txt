Chinese Buddhism has a long history and has played an important role in shaping the country's culture, philosophy, and spirituality. However, as with any religious group, Buddhist monastics in China face unique challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the challenges faced by native Chinese speaker monastic Buddhist people in the legal system:

1. Legal recognition: In China, Buddhist monasteries and temples are not officially recognized as legal entities, which can limit their access to resources and opportunities. This can make it difficult for monastics to receive state support or funding for their religious activities.
2. Property rights: Chinese law does not provide clear property rights for Buddhist monasteries and temples, which can lead to disputes over land ownership and control. This can be particularly challenging in areas where there are multiple Buddhist communities competing for limited resources.
3. Freedom of religion: While China's constitution guarantees the freedom of religious belief, in practice, Buddhist monastics may face restrictions on their religious activities. For example, they may be prohibited from gathering in large numbers or from engaging in certain religious practices that are deemed "sensitive" by the government.
4. Gender inequality: In some Buddhist communities in China, there is a lack of recognition and respect for women's rights. This can manifest in various ways, such as limited opportunities for women to participate in religious ceremonies or hold leadership positions within the monastery.
5. Access to education: Many Buddhist monastics in China face barriers to accessing education, particularly those living in rural areas. This can limit their ability to gain a formal education and access higher learning opportunities.
6. Social stigma: In some parts of China, there may be a social stigma associated with being a Buddhist monastic. This can lead to discrimination and marginalization, which can make it difficult for monastics to integrate into society.
7. Government interference: The Chinese government has been known to interfere with the religious practices of Buddhist communities. For example, in 2018, the government ordered the closure of a Buddhist temple in Tibet due to alleged "illegal" activities. This can create an environment of fear and mistrust within the community.
