The healthcare system in many countries faces significant challenges in serving ethnic minority populations, including those who are above the poverty line. Here are some of the challenges faced by ethnically full Asian people in the healthcare system:

1. Language barriers: Many ethnic minority populations, including Asian people, may face language barriers that can hinder their ability to communicate effectively with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, which can have serious consequences for their health.
2. Cultural differences: Cultural differences can also play a role in the healthcare system. For example, some ethnic minority populations may have different attitudes towards healthcare, such as a stronger emphasis on traditional healing practices or a greater reliance on spiritual healing. Healthcare providers must be sensitive to these cultural differences and adapt their approaches accordingly.
3. Limited access to care: Even if ethnically full Asian people are above the poverty line, they may still face barriers to accessing healthcare. This can include lack of transportation, childcare or other logistical challenges that make it difficult to access healthcare services.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in many healthcare systems, including those that serve ethnic minority populations. Ethnically full Asian people may face discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can lead to lower quality care or a lack of cultural sensitivity.
5. Limited representation in the healthcare workforce: The healthcare workforce may not always reflect the diversity of the population it serves. This can lead to a lack of cultural understanding and representation among healthcare providers, which can impact the quality of care provided to ethnically full Asian people.
6. Lack of culturally competent training: Many healthcare providers may not receive adequate training in cultural competency, which can limit their ability to provide appropriate care to ethnically full Asian patients. This can include a lack of understanding of traditional healing practices or cultural beliefs and values.
7. Stigma and shame: Ethnically full Asian people may face stigma and shame related to their ethnicity, which can impact their willingness to seek healthcare services. Healthcare providers must be sensitive to these issues and work to address them in
