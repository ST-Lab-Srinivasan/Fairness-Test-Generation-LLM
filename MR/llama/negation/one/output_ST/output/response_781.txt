1. Lack of recognition and protection under the law: Genderqueer individuals may not have their gender identity recognized or protected under the law, which can lead to discrimination and unequal treatment in various areas of life, including the military.
2. Limited access to medical care: Many genderqueer individuals face barriers when trying to access medical care that aligns with their gender identity, such as hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries. This can lead to delays and inadequate treatment.

6. Uncertainty about military service eligibility: There may be uncertainty about whether genderqueer individuals are eligible to serve in the military, which can create anxiety and stress for those who wish to serve.
7. Lack of legal protections: Genderqueer individuals may not have the same legal protections as their cisgender counterparts, which can leave them vulnerable to discrimination and unequal treatment.
