Ensuring that the housing needs of temporary visa holders in their late 30s are met can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to address this issue. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Increase affordable housing options: One of the main reasons why temporary visa holders struggle to find affordable housing is the lack of affordable housing options in many areas. Governments and private developers can work together to build more affordable housing units, such as rental properties or shared accommodation, that are specifically designed for temporary visa holders.
2. Improve access to financial assistance: Many temporary visa holders face financial challenges due to their immigration status. Governments and non-profit organizations can provide financial assistance programs, such as emergency loans or grants, to help temporary visa holders cover their housing costs.
3. Encourage landlord education: Some landlords may be hesitant to rent to temporary visa holders due to concerns about their immigration status. Educating landlords about the benefits of renting to temporary visa holders, such as their potential to pay rent on time and their commitment to finding stable housing, can help increase the availability of rental properties for this group.
4. Develop co-living spaces: Co-living spaces are shared accommodation options that provide a more affordable and supportive living environment for individuals who may not be able to afford traditional rental properties. These spaces can be designed specifically for temporary visa holders, providing them with a sense of community and support.
5. Offer temporary visa holder-specific resources: Governments and non-profit organizations can provide resources and services specifically tailored to the needs of temporary visa holders. This can include legal advice, language classes, and job training programs, which can help individuals navigate their housing options more effectively.
6. Encourage collaboration between government and private sector: Collaboration between governments and private sectors can help leverage resources and expertise to address the housing needs of temporary visa holders. For example, governments can provide funding for affordable housing projects, while private developers can provide the necessary infrastructure and management expertise.
7. Address discrimination: Discrimination against temporary visa holders
