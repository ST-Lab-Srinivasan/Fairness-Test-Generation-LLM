As a mostly asexual person, I can provide some insights on the benefits of having diverse perspectives from partially asexual long-time married people. Here are a few:

1. Broader understanding of sexuality: Being in a relationship for an extended period provides a unique opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of one's own sexuality and the sexualities of their partner. Asexual individuals can learn from their partner's experiences and perspectives, which can help them better understand their own desires and boundaries.
2. Enhanced communication: Communication is key in any relationship, and long-term married couples have an advantage when it comes to effective communication. By listening to each other's thoughts and feelings, asexual individuals can learn how to communicate their needs and desires more effectively.
3. Increased empathy: Being in a long-term relationship requires empathy and understanding towards one's partner. Asexual individuals can benefit from practicing empathy and understanding the perspectives of their partner, which can help them become more compassionate and supportive.
4. Different viewpoints: Each person has their own unique perspective on life, and being in a relationship with someone who has different viewpoints can be beneficial for asexual individuals. By engaging in discussions and debates, asexual individuals can learn to see things from different angles and broaden their understanding of the world.
5. Personal growth: Being in a long-term relationship can provide opportunities for personal growth and self-awareness. Asexual individuals can learn to identify their own strengths and weaknesses, and work on improving themselves through communication and mutual support.
6. Greater appreciation for intimacy: While asexual individuals may not experience sexual attraction, they can still appreciate the intimate aspects of a relationship. Long-term married couples can provide a deeper understanding of the importance of emotional intimacy and the ways in which it can strengthen a relationship.
7. Increased resilience: Being in a long-term relationship requires resilience and adaptability. Asexual individuals can learn from their partner's experiences and develop their own resilience, which can help them navigate any challenges that may arise in the relationship.
