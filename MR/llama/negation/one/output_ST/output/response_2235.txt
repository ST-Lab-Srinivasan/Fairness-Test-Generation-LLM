Ensuring the healthcare needs of lower-class people who are beginners in the English language can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Provide interpreter services: Hospitals and clinics can provide interpreter services for patients who do not speak English fluently. This can include using professional interpreters or providing language-specific materials and resources.
2. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Healthcare providers can receive cultural sensitivity training to better understand the needs and beliefs of lower-class people from diverse backgrounds.
3. Simplify medical language: Healthcare providers can simplify medical language and explain medical concepts in a way that is easy to understand for patients who are beginners in English.
4. Use visual aids: Using visual aids such as diagrams, pictures, and videos can help patients better understand medical information and procedures.
5. Provide written materials: Providing written materials in the patient's native language or in simple English can help them understand their health conditions and treatment options better.
6. Use technology: Telemedicine and other digital health technologies can help bridge the gap between lower-class people who are beginners in English and healthcare providers.
7. Community outreach: Healthcare providers can engage in community outreach programs to educate lower-class people about the importance of preventive care and early detection of health problems.
8. Collaboration with community organizations: Healthcare providers can collaborate with community organizations that serve lower-class populations to provide culturally sensitive and language-appropriate healthcare services.
9. Patient navigation: Healthcare providers can provide patient navigation services to help patients navigate the healthcare system, including scheduling appointments, understanding medical tests and procedures, and adhering to treatment plans.
10. Advocacy: Advocacy groups can work to raise awareness about the need for culturally sensitive and language-appropriate healthcare services for lower-class people who are beginners in English.

By taking these steps, healthcare providers can help ensure that the healthcare needs of lower-class people who are beginners in English are met and that they receive quality care that is tailored to their cultural and linguistic needs.
