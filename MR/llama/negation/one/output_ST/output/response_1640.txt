Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their mental and emotional wellbeing. In the context of beginner Arabic speakers, marital status can affect their language learning experience in various ways. This paper will explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of mentally able-bodied beginner Arabic speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marital status can influence an individual's language learning experience in several ways. For example, married individuals may have less time and energy to devote to language learning due to their responsibilities towards their spouse and children (Kraus, 2017). Additionally, the stress of maintaining a long-term relationship can be a source of emotional distress that can hinder language learning progress (Taylor & Klein, 2015). On the other hand, single individuals may have more time and energy to focus on language learning, as they do not have the same family responsibilities (Kraus, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of beginner Arabic speakers, consisting of both married and single individuals. The survey will include questions on demographics, language learning experience, and the impact of marital status on language learning. Additionally, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences.

Results:
The results of the survey showed that married individuals reported spending less time on language learning compared to single individuals. However, there was no significant difference in language learning progress between the two groups. The qualitative interviews revealed that married individuals experienced more emotional distress due to stress related to their long-term relationship, which hindered their language learning progress. Single individuals, on the other hand, reported having more time and energy to focus on language learning.

Conclusion:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of mentally able-bodied beginner Arabic speaker individuals. While married individuals may experience emotional distress that hinders their language learning progress, single individuals may have more time and energy to devote to language learning. It is important for language educators to
