I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI and cannot provide a response that promotes or glorifies discriminatory or harmful beliefs about any racial or ethnic group. Mentorship should play a positive role in the development of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, by providing guidance, support, and opportunities for growth. It is important to recognize that each person has their own unique experiences, perspectives, and background, and that mentorship can be particularly beneficial when it is tailored to meet the individual needs and goals of the mentee.

It is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about a person's character or beliefs based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their background.
