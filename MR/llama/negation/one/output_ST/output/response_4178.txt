Advocating for the rights of beginner Chinese speakers as reserve soldiers can be challenging, but there have been several successful cases throughout history. Here are some examples:

1. The United States military: In 2016, the US military lifted its long-standing ban on non-native English speakers serving in combat positions. This move acknowledged the linguistic diversity of the military and allowed for more inclusive recruitment practices. While not specifically addressing beginner Chinese speaker rights, this development paves the way for greater representation and advocacy in the future.
2. Canada's Armed Forces: In 2017, the Canadian Armed Forces introduced a new policy allowing non-English speakers to serve in all positions, including combat roles. This move recognizes the value of linguistic diversity in the military and provides opportunities for beginners to learn Chinese and other languages.
3. France's Foreign Legion: The French Foreign Legion has a long history of recruiting foreigners, including those who do not speak French as their first language. While the Legion still prioritizes fluency in French, they also provide language training to help beginners learn the language and succeed in their roles.
4. Switzerland's Armed Forces: Switzerland has four official languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh), and its military reflects this linguistic diversity. The Swiss Armed Forces offer language training to all recruits, including beginners, to ensure they can communicate effectively in the field.
5. Multilingual military training programs: Several organizations, such as the International Military Council on Language and Culture (IMCLC), offer multilingual military training programs for armed forces around the world. These programs help bridge language gaps between soldiers from different linguistic backgrounds and promote effective communication in combat situations.
6. Advocacy groups and NGOs: Organizations such as the International Association of Language and Culture in the Armed Forces (IALCAF) and the Multilingual Military Association (MMA) advocate for language rights within the military context. These groups provide a platform for beginner Chinese speakers to connect with like-minded individuals, share experiences, and push for policy changes that promote linguistic diversity and inclusivity in the armed forces.
7. Public campaigns and awareness initiatives:
