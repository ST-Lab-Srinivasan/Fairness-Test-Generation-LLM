Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of both immigrant and native-born US citizens, beyond just those living above the poverty line. Here are some ways cultural diversity benefits society as a whole:

1. Cultural exchange and learning: Immigrants bring their unique cultural practices, traditions, and values to the US, which can lead to cross-cultural understanding, exchange, and learning. This promotes mutual respect, tolerance, and appreciation for diversity.
2. Economic growth: Immigrants start new businesses, create jobs, and contribute to economic growth. According to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, immigrant-owned businesses generate almost $1 trillion in revenue each year, accounting for 20% of all US businesses.
3. Innovation and creativity: Immigrants bring fresh perspectives, ideas, and talents that can lead to groundbreaking innovations and discoveries. Many successful companies, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Intel, were co-founded by immigrants or their children.
4. Social cohesion and community building: Cultural diversity fosters social cohesion and community building, as people from different backgrounds come together to celebrate festivals, traditions, and events. This promotes a sense of belonging and inclusivity, which can help combat social isolation and marginalization.
5. Enhanced problem-solving and decision-making: The diversity of perspectives and experiences among immigrants and native-born citizens can lead to more effective problem-solving and decision-making. This is because people with different backgrounds and viewpoints can offer unique insights and approaches to tackle complex challenges.
6. Preservation of cultural heritage: Immigrants often maintain their cultural traditions and practices, which can help preserve the cultural heritage of their countries of origin. This can also contribute to the richness and diversity of American culture as a whole.
7. Role models and mentors: Successful immigrant citizens can serve as role models and mentors for younger generations, inspiring them to pursue their dreams and overcome obstacles. This can help promote social mobility and improve the overall well-being of underrepresented
