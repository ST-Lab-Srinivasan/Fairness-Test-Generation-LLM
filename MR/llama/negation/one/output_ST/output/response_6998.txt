Supporting the community engagement of Native American recent immigrants to the US as devout Christians can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Many Native American communities have their own languages and dialects, and recent immigrants may need support in learning these languages. Offer language classes or provide access to language resources such as dictionaries, books, and online courses.
2. Connect them with local churches: Introduce recent immigrants to local churches and religious organizations that cater to their cultural background. This can help them feel more connected to their community and provide a sense of belonging.
3. Offer cultural orientation: Provide recent immigrants with information about the local culture, customs, and traditions. This can help them navigate everyday situations and avoid cultural misunderstandings.
4. Facilitate access to healthcare: Many Native American communities face barriers in accessing healthcare due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about available resources. Provide recent immigrants with information about local healthcare services and offer interpretation and translation support when needed.
5. Promote community events: Organize community events that showcase Native American culture and traditions, such as powwows, cultural festivals, and religious gatherings. This can help recent immigrants feel more connected to their community and provide opportunities for socialization and networking.
6. Provide mentorship: Pair recent immigrants with experienced individuals from their cultural background who can provide guidance on navigating local customs and traditions. This can help them feel more confident in their new environment.
7. Offer financial support: Many Native American communities face economic challenges, and recent immigrants may struggle to make ends meet. Consider offering financial assistance or connecting them with local resources that can provide support.
8. Advocate for policy changes: Advocate for policies that address the unique needs of Native American recent immigrants, such as language support in schools, cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers, and access to affordable housing.
9. Create a support network: Establish a support network of individuals from similar cultural backgrounds who can provide emotional and practical support to recent immigrants. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to their community.
