Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong recently single French speaker individuals. It is essential to understand how cultural heritage influences identity formation, particularly in the context of singlehood. This paper explores the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of lifelong recently single native French speakers.

Theory:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared knowledge, beliefs, values, customs, and practices of a particular group or society (Hood, 2015). It is transmitted through socialization and cultural institutions, such as language, education, religion, and media (Brown, 2017). Cultural heritage shapes the identities of individuals by providing a sense of belonging, shared values, and cultural practices that are passed down from generation to generation.

Identity Formation:
Identity formation is a complex process that involves the interaction between individual experiences, social structures, and cultural norms (Hall, 1980). Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong recently single French speaker individuals. For example, cultural values such as family and relationships are deeply ingrained in French society, making it challenging for individuals to reconcile their identity after a divorce or separation (Bauman, 2001).

Cultural heritage also influences the way individuals perceive themselves and their place in society. For instance, the concept of "la belle France" (the beautiful France) perpetuates the idea that French culture is refined, sophisticated, and romantic (Hobsbawm & Ranger, 1983). This cultural narrative can make it difficult for individuals to reconcile their identity as a single person with the cultural expectations of being French.

Identity Reconciliation:
Reconciling one's identity after a divorce or separation is a challenging process (Komaki & Bauserman, 1987). Cultural heritage can both facilitate and hinder this process. On the one hand, shared cultural values and practices can provide a sense of belonging and support during difficult times (Hall, 1980). On the other hand, cultural expectations and norms can create pressure to conform to certain roles or identities
