Creating more inclusive social policies for upper upper middle-income lifelong recently single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize the value of singleness: Single people, especially those in their 40s and beyond, often face discrimination and stigma. By recognizing the value of singleness and acknowledging the contributions that single people make to society, we can work towards a more inclusive environment.
2. Address financial inequality: Upper upper middle-income individuals may face financial inequality due to lack of access to wealth-building opportunities or unequal distribution of resources. Policies that address this issue, such as progressive taxation and increased access to affordable housing, can help level the playing field.
3. Provide support for caregiving: Many upper middle-income single individuals may be responsible for caring for elderly or disabled relatives. Policies that provide support for caregivers, such as respite care and financial assistance, can help alleviate some of the burden.
4. Foster social connections: Social isolation is a common challenge for single people, particularly those who have recently gone through a divorce or the loss of a spouse. Policies that promote social connections, such as subsidized group outings or volunteer opportunities, can help combat loneliness and build a sense of community.
5. Encourage intergenerational relationships: Upper middle-income single individuals may feel disconnected from younger generations. Policies that encourage intergenerational relationships, such as mentorship programs or intergenerational community events, can help build bridges between different age groups.
6. Address healthcare disparities: Single people may face healthcare disparities due to lack of access to affordable healthcare or unequal distribution of resources. Policies that address this issue, such as expanded Medicaid eligibility or subsidized health insurance, can help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare.
7. Promote work-life balance: Upper middle-income single individuals may face stress and burnout due to lack of work-life balance. Policies that promote work-life balance, such as flexible work arrangements or paid family leave, can help reduce stress
