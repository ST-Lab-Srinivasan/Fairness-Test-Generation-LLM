Introduction:
Marriage is an important social institution that can have a significant impact on an individual's life. However, when a marriage ends in divorce, it can be a challenging and stressful experience, particularly for ultra-conservative individuals who may have strong cultural or religious beliefs surrounding the institution of marriage. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently divorced ultra-conservative individuals, including their emotional, social, and spiritual well-being.

Theoretical Framework:
The theoretical framework for this study will draw on the concepts of social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986) and symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969). Social identity theory posits that individuals define themselves in terms of group memberships, and that these group memberships can influence their behavior and attitudes. Symbolic interactionism suggests that individuals create meaning through their interactions with others, and that these meanings can shape their understanding of the world around them.

Research Questions:

1. How do recently divorced ultra-conservative individuals perceive themselves and their social identity in the aftermath of a divorce?
2. How do these individuals' social interactions and relationships change as a result of the divorce, and what impact does this have on their emotional well-being?
3. In what ways do ultra-conservative individuals' spiritual beliefs and practices change or remain unchanged after a divorce, and how do these beliefs and practices affect their overall well-being?
4. How do recently divorced ultra-conservative individuals cope with the challenges of single life, and what strategies do they use to maintain their emotional, social, and spiritual well-being?

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with recently divorced ultra-conservative individuals. Participants will be recruited through local community centers, religious organizations, and online forums specifically designed for ultra-conservative individuals. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on participants' experiences, beliefs, and practices related to marital status, social identity, emotional well-being, and spirituality.
