As a beginner Chinese speaker and a native French speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in China. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: The legal terminology and concepts in China are often unfamiliar to non-native speakers, especially if they are not fluent in Chinese. This can make it difficult to understand legal documents, procedures, and concepts, which could lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique cultural context that may differ from what you are used to in France. For example, the concept of "guanxi" (relationships) is highly valued in Chinese culture, which may affect how legal proceedings are conducted and resolved. Understanding these cultural differences is crucial for effective communication and navigation of the legal system.
3. Different legal framework: China has a civil law system, which is different from the common law system used in France. This means that the legal concepts, procedures, and terminology may be unfamiliar to French speakers, even if they are fluent in Chinese.
4. Limited resources: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not have access to the same resources as native Chinese speakers, such as legal dictionaries or databases. This can make it more difficult to research and understand legal concepts and terminology.
5. Different judicial system: China has a people's court system, which is different from the inquisitorial system used in France. Understanding how this system works and how it differs from your own legal system can be challenging.
6. Limited experience with Chinese law: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not have much experience with Chinese law, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system and understand the nuances of the law.
7. Different legal concepts: China has its own unique legal concepts and terminology, which may be unfamiliar to French speakers. For example, the concept of "state power" is highly valued in Chinese law, while the concept of "individual rights" is more prominent in French law.
8. Limited access to legal resources: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not have easy access to legal resources such as law libraries or online databases, which can make it difficult to research and understand legal concepts and terminology.
