Creating more inclusive social policies for non-high-income professional, non-divorced multiple times individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this demographic. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Increase access to affordable education and job training: Many non-high-income professionals face significant barriers to advancing in their careers due to lack of access to quality education and job training opportunities. Governments can invest in programs that provide low-cost or free education and training, such as vocational training, certification programs, and online courses.
2. Address the gender pay gap: Non-high-income professional women often face significant wage disparities compared to their male counterparts. Governments can implement policies to address this issue, such as conducting regular pay audits, implementing equal pay laws, and providing family-friendly benefits like paid parental leave.
3. Support work-life balance: Non-high-income professionals often struggle to balance work and personal responsibilities due to lack of flexible work arrangements. Governments can promote workplace flexibility by providing incentives for employers who offer telecommuting, flexible schedules, and other work-life balance benefits.
4. Improve access to affordable healthcare: Non-high-income professionals may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to lack of insurance or financial constraints. Governments can implement policies to improve access to affordable healthcare, such as expanding Medicaid coverage, providing subsidies for health insurance premiums, and increasing funding for community clinics.
5. Address the digital divide: Non-high-income professionals may face challenges in accessing technology and digital resources, which can hinder their ability to compete in the job market. Governments can invest in initiatives that provide low-cost or free access to digital technologies, such as public computer labs, Wi-Fi hotspots, and online learning platforms.
6. Promote financial literacy: Many non-high-income professionals may lack access to financial resources and education, which can limit their ability to save for retirement or invest in their future. Governments can provide financial literacy programs and resources to help individuals better manage their finances and plan for the future.
