Creating more inclusive social policies for deep in poverty, long-term widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Data collection and analysis: Collect data on the demographics, income, and expenses of long-term widows to understand their specific needs and challenges. This will help identify areas where policies can be tailored to address their unique circumstances.
2. Increase access to education and job training: Provide opportunities for long-term widows to acquire new skills and knowledge that can help them find employment or start their own businesses. This can include vocational training, entrepreneurship programs, and scholarships.
3. Address systemic barriers: Long-term widows often face discrimination and marginalization due to societal attitudes and gender roles. Policies should address these systemic barriers by promoting gender equality and challenging harmful social norms.
4. Increase access to healthcare: Ensure that long-term widows have access to quality healthcare, including reproductive health services, mental health support, and chronic disease management.
5. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance, such as microfinance programs, savings accounts, or low-interest loans, to help long-term widows manage their finances and improve their economic stability.
6. Address housing needs: Many long-term widows face challenges in accessing secure and affordable housing. Policies can address this by providing subsidized housing options, rent support, or home repair grants.
7. Promote social connections: Long-term widows often experience social isolation due to their circumstances. Policies can promote social connections by facilitating access to community events, support groups, and volunteer opportunities.
8. Advocate for policy change: Advocate for policy changes at the local and national levels to address the unique needs of long-term widows. This can include advocating for increased funding for programs that benefit widows, challenging discriminatory laws or practices, and promoting gender equality in all areas of life.
9. Support networks: Create support networks for long-term widows, such as peer support groups
