Ensuring the healthcare needs of Mexican average earners is a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that could help:

1. Improve access to healthcare services: Many Mexican citizens, particularly those in rural and marginalized areas, lack access to basic healthcare services due to geographic and economic barriers. Increasing the number of healthcare facilities, improving transportation infrastructure, and providing financial support for low-income individuals can help address this issue.
2. Strengthen the public health system: Mexico's public health system is overburdened and underfunded, leading to inadequate access to quality care. Increasing funding for the public health system, hiring more healthcare professionals, and implementing efficient management systems can help improve the quality of care.
3. Promote preventive care: Preventive care is essential to address the root causes of poor health outcomes in Mexico. Implementing programs that promote healthy behaviors, such as nutrition education, exercise programs, and smoking cessation initiatives, can help reduce the burden on the healthcare system.
4. Foster collaboration between public and private sectors: Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and private sector organizations can help leverage resources and expertise to address healthcare challenges in Mexico. This includes partnerships for disease surveillance, vaccination programs, and mental health services.
5. Address social determinants of health: Many health problems in Mexico are linked to broader social and economic factors, such as poverty, malnutrition, and lack of access to clean water and sanitation. Addressing these social determinants through policies that promote economic growth, education, and social welfare can help improve overall health outcomes.
6. Invest in digital health technologies: Digital health technologies, such as telemedicine and mobile health applications, can help increase access to care, particularly for rural or marginalized communities. These technologies can also help streamline healthcare services, reduce costs, and improve patient engagement.
7. Support community-based care: Community-based care models, such as village clinics and neighborhood health centers, can help provide more accessible and culturally sensitive healthcare services to marginalized populations
