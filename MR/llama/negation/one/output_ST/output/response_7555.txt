As a beginner French speaker and long-term recently widowed person, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some potential obstacles and strategies to help you overcome them:

1. Language barrier: As a beginner French speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a professional setting. To overcome this challenge, consider taking language classes or using language learning apps to improve your proficiency.
