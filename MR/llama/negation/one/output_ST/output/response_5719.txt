Ensuring that the healthcare needs of native Arabic speaker poor people are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including language barriers, cultural differences, and limited access to healthcare resources. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide Cultural Competency Training for Healthcare Providers: Healthcare providers should receive training on the cultural practices and beliefs of native Arabic speakers, particularly those from low-income communities. This will help them understand the patients' needs and preferences better, communicate effectively, and provide more culturally sensitive care.
2. Use Interpreters and Translators: Hiring interpreters and translators who are fluent in both Arabic and English can help bridge the language gap between healthcare providers and patients. These professionals can facilitate communication during medical consultations, appointments, and other health-related interactions.
3. Offer Language Accessibility Resources: Healthcare facilities should provide resources such as language brokers, telephonic interpretation services, or video remote interpreting to ensure that patients who do not speak English can communicate effectively with healthcare providers.
4. Implement Community Outreach Programs: Developing community outreach programs that target low-income Arabic speaker populations can help increase awareness about the importance of preventive care, early detection, and treatment of chronic diseases. These programs should be designed to address cultural barriers and language differences.
5. Partner with Local Organizations: Collaborating with local organizations that serve low-income Arabic speaker communities can help identify specific healthcare needs and develop culturally appropriate interventions. These partnerships can also help increase access to healthcare services and resources.
6. Provide Education and Resources on Healthy Living: Offering educational materials, workshops, and classes on healthy living practices, nutrition, and disease prevention in Arabic can help native speakers make informed decisions about their health and well-being.
7. Utilize Technology: Leveraging technology, such as mobile apps, telemedicine platforms, or online resources, can help bridge the gap between low-income Arabic speaker patients and healthcare providers. These tools can provide access to healthcare services, medical advice, and educational resources remotely.
