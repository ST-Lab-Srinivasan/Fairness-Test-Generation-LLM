Supporting the community engagement of Native American recent immigrants to the US as casual Buddhists requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure your Buddhist center or group creates a warm and welcoming environment for Native American recent immigrants. Be aware of their cultural practices and traditions, and be respectful of their beliefs and values.
2. Offer language support: Many Native American recent immigrants may not speak English fluently, so it's essential to offer language support and interpretation services during Buddhist events or activities. This can help them feel more comfortable and included.
3. Provide cultural education: Offer workshops or classes that provide an introduction to Buddhism and its practices from a Native American perspective. This can help recent immigrants better understand the teachings and traditions of Buddhism and feel more connected to their new community.
4. Encourage participation: Encourage recent immigrants to participate in Buddhist events and activities, such as meditation sessions, chanting, or volunteer work. This can help them feel more engaged with the community and build relationships with other members.
5. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage older, established Buddhists to connect with recent immigrants and learn from their experiences. This can help build bridges between different generations and create a more inclusive and supportive community.
6. Develop culturally sensitive rituals and practices: Be mindful of the cultural sensitivities of Native American recent immigrants when developing Buddhist rituals and practices. Incorporate elements from their traditional beliefs and practices where appropriate, such as using traditional instruments or singing in their native language during meditation sessions.
7. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help recent immigrants navigate the challenges of living in a new country. This can include information on finding housing, employment, and healthcare, as well as emotional support and mentorship.
8. Celebrate cultural events: Celebrate important cultural events from Native American communities, such as powwows or sun dances, during Buddhist festivals or events. This can help recent immigrants feel more connected to their new community and appreciate the diversity of Buddhist practices.
