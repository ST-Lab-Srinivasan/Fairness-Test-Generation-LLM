To ensure that the housing needs of passport holder young adult individuals in their 20s are met, several strategies can be employed. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Increase Affordable Housing Options: Governments and developers can work together to create more affordable housing options, such as rental units or co-living spaces, that are within reach of young adults with passports. This can be achieved through initiatives like inclusionary zoning, tax incentives, or public-private partnerships.
2. Encourage Homeownership: Governments can offer financial assistance programs, such as mortgage subsidies or down payment assistance, to help young adults with passports purchase their first home. This can be particularly effective for those who are struggling to save for a down payment due to high housing costs in urban areas.
3. Promote Community Land Trusts: Community land trusts (CLTs) are non-profit organizations that own and manage land on behalf of the community. Young adults with passports can benefit from CLTs by accessing affordable homeownership options, as well as renting properties at below-market rates.
4. Foster Innovative Housing Solutions: Technological advancements and innovative design can lead to more efficient and cost-effective housing solutions. For example, modular construction or tiny homes could provide affordable housing options for young adults with passports in urban areas.
5. Address Housing Discrimination: Young adults with passports may face discrimination when seeking housing, particularly if they are members of marginalized groups. Governments and housing providers must address this issue by implementing anti-discrimination policies and practices, as well as increasing diversity in the housing market.
6. Support Alternative Housing Models: Co-living spaces, shared housing, and intentional communities can provide affordable and supportive housing options for young adults with passports. These models can foster a sense of community and mutual support among residents.
7. Advocate for Progressive Housing Policies: Governments can implement policies that promote affordable and inclusive housing, such as rent control, tenant protection laws, and zoning regulations that prioritize density and diversity in urban areas
