Addressing the specific needs of non-widowed, long-time native Chinese speakers in education requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that educators can consider:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Design curricula and teaching methods that reflect the cultural backgrounds and experiences of non-widowed, long-time native Chinese speakers. This may involve incorporating authentic texts, images, and practices from Chinese culture into the classroom.
