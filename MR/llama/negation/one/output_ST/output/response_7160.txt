Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those from ethnically full African-American communities, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Create safe spaces: Establish spaces where individuals can freely express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. These spaces should be conducive to open communication, respectful of cultural differences, and free from any form of oppression.
2. Empower marginalized communities: Prioritize the involvement of marginalized communities in decision-making processes by providing them with opportunities for leadership and participation. This can be achieved through training programs, mentorship initiatives, and other forms of capacity-building.
3. Use inclusive language: Adopt language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures and identities. This can involve using diverse terminology, avoiding stereotypes, and actively listening to the perspectives of marginalized communities.
4. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with organizations and community groups that represent marginalized communities to ensure their voices are heard in decision-making processes. These partnerships can help amplify their voices and create a platform for them to advocate for their rights and interests.
5. Provide education and resources: Offer training, workshops, and other educational resources to marginalized communities to empower them with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively participate in decision-making processes. This can include language training, leadership development, and cultural competency training.
6. Encourage media representation: Promote diverse representation in media outlets to counterbalance the historical lack of visibility and voice for marginalized communities. This can involve supporting independent media outlets, amplifying marginalized voices through social media, and creating opportunities for marginalized individuals to share their stories and perspectives.
7. Address power imbalances: Identify and address any power imbalances that may exist within decision-making processes, such as a lack of representation or unequal distribution of resources. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote equity and inclusivity.
8. Use technology to facilitate participation: Utilize digital platforms and tools to enable marginalized communities to participate in decision-making processes remot
