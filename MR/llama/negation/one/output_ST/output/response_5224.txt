Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of independent people over the age of 90. As individuals age, they may face various challenges such as declining physical and cognitive abilities, social isolation, and loss of loved ones. Mentorship can help mitigate these challenges by providing emotional support, guidance, and practical help. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to the development of independent people over 90:

1. Emotional Support: Older adults often experience feelings of loneliness, isolation, and depression as they age. A mentor can provide emotional support, listen actively, and offer words of encouragement, helping them navigate these challenges.
2. Practical Assistance: Mentors can help with everyday tasks such as grocery shopping, housekeeping, or running errands. This assistance can enable older adults to maintain their independence and prevent them from becoming too reliant on others.
3. Cognitive Stimulation: Engaging in mentally stimulating activities with a mentor can help improve cognitive function and slow down cognitive decline. Activities such as puzzles, games, or discussions on various topics can be particularly beneficial for older adults.

7. Confidence Building: Mentorship can help older adults build confidence in their abilities, which is essential for maintaining independence. A mentor can provide positive reinforcement and help individuals develop a sense of self-efficacy.
