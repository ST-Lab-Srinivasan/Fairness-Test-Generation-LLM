Creating more inclusive housing policies for early pregnancy (1st trimester) recently divorced individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accommodations for pregnant women: Housing providers can offer accommodations such as extra support or modified duties to help pregnant women during their first trimester. For example, they could provide temporary modifications to the home, such as installing grab bars in the bathroom or providing a comfortable seating area for rest and relaxation.
2. Flexible lease terms: Housing providers can offer flexible lease terms that take into account the unique needs of recently divorced individuals who are experiencing pregnancy. For example, they could provide temporary rent reductions or extensions to help these individuals during this challenging time.
3. Access to prenatal care: Housing providers can work with local healthcare providers to ensure that residents have access to prenatal care and other reproductive health services. This can involve providing information on nearby clinics or hospitals, as well as offering transportation assistance for residents who may need it.
4. Support groups: Housing providers can facilitate support groups for pregnant women who are recently divorced. These groups can provide a safe space for individuals to share their experiences and connect with others who may be going through similar challenges.
5. Childcare resources: Housing providers can offer resources and referrals for childcare services, including drop-in care, nannies, or babysitting cooperatives. This can help recently divorced individuals who are experiencing pregnancy to manage their daily responsibilities while also providing support for their growing family.
6. Financial assistance: Housing providers can offer financial assistance programs, such as emergency grants or low-interest loans, to help recently divorced individuals cover the costs of pregnancy and childbirth. These funds can be used for a variety of purposes, including prenatal care, maternity clothes, and baby supplies.
7. Access to mental health services: Housing providers can work with local mental health professionals to offer counseling and therapy services to residents who may be experiencing anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns
