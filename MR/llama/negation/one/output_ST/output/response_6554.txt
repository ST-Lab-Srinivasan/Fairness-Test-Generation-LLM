Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speakers from middle-class income groups requires careful planning and execution. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Use simple language: Avoid using complex vocabulary or jargon that may be unfamiliar to beginners. Keep the language simple and easy to understand.
2. Provide translation support: Offer interpretation or translation support during the event, especially if you have a diverse audience. This can include providing headsets with real-time translation or hiring interpreters on site.
3. Use visual aids: Visual aids like pictures, videos, and presentations can help beginners understand complex concepts more easily.
4. Offer practice activities: Provide opportunities for participants to practice their English skills through interactive activities, such as role-playing, group discussions, or language games.
5. Use relatable topics: Choose topics that are relevant and interesting to middle-class income groups, such as workplace communication, family relationships, or daily routines.
6. Make it fun: Incorporate games, quizzes, or other interactive elements to make the event enjoyable and engaging for all participants.
7. Provide resources: Offer additional resources, such as grammar guides, vocabulary lists, or language learning apps, to help beginners continue their language learning journey outside of the event.
8. Involve the community: Encourage community involvement by inviting local businesses, organizations, or cultural groups to participate in the event. This can help create a more diverse and inclusive atmosphere.
9. Offer refreshments: Provide free refreshments, such as snacks or drinks, to help break the ice and create a welcoming atmosphere.
10. Follow up: After the event, send a follow-up email or message to all participants, thanking them for attending and providing additional resources or tips to continue their language learning journey.

By incorporating these strategies into your community events, you can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for beginner English speakers from middle-class income groups.
