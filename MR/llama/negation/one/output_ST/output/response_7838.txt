Celebrating the diversity of recently early pregnant active-duty individuals can be a great way to support and include them in military life during their challenging first trimester. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Host virtual events: Due to the nature of military life, it may be difficult for early pregnant service members to attend in-person events. Hosting virtual events such as webinars, video conferences, or online workshops can help them feel included and engaged.
