Promoting the educational success of natural-born Indian citizens who are not disabled requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors influencing their academic performance. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Early Intervention and Support: Provide early intervention and support to children from marginalized communities, including those belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs). This could include initiatives like early childhood education, parental involvement programs, and mentorship opportunities.
2. Quality Education: Ensure that schools in marginalized communities have access to quality educational resources, including well-trained teachers, modern infrastructure, and up-to-date curricula. This can help bridge the gap between privileged and underprivileged schools.
3. Financial Support: Offer financial support to students from marginalized communities through scholarships, stipends, and other forms of assistance. This can help reduce the economic burden on families and enable them to invest more in their children's education.
4. Cultural Relevance: Ensure that the educational content is culturally relevant and responsive to the needs of diverse student populations. This can involve incorporating local languages, customs, and practices into the curriculum.
5. Mental Health Support: Provide mental health support services to students, particularly those from marginalized communities, who may be more vulnerable to stress, anxiety, and other mental health challenges due to systemic barriers and discrimination.
6. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in education by involving parents, local leaders, and community organizations in the educational process. This can help build a supportive and inclusive learning environment.
7. Technology Integration: Leverage technology to enhance learning outcomes, particularly for students from marginalized communities who may have limited access to resources. This could involve digital content, online tutoring, and other tech-based interventions.
8. Teacher Training: Provide regular training and capacity-building programs for teachers in marginalized communities to enhance their pedagogical skills and subject matter expertise.
9. Flexible Learning Paths: Offer flexible learning paths that cater to the diverse needs
