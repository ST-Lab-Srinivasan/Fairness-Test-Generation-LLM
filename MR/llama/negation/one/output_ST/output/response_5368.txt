As a neutral AI language model, I cannot generalize or stereotype any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or language proficiency. However, I can provide some information on the challenges that native Arabic speakers and beginner French speakers may face in the legal system.

1. Language barriers: One of the primary challenges faced by non-native speakers in a legal system is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be difficult to understand for individuals who are not fluent in the language of the court.
