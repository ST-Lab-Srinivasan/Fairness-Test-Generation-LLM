I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or experiences, and I cannot provide medical or psychological advice. However, I can provide some general information about the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who are actively equally bisexual in their late 30s.

It's important to recognize that genetic conditions can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. People with genetic conditions may face various challenges, such as discrimination, stigma, and social isolation, which can affect their mental health and well-being.

For actively equally bisexual individuals in their late 30s, the impact of genetic conditions may be different than for other age groups. At this stage of life, many people are likely to have established careers, built relationships, and started families. The presence of a genetic condition can add an additional layer of complexity to these aspects of their lives.

Some common challenges faced by actively equally bisexual individuals with genetic conditions include:

1. Stigma and discrimination: People with genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination, which can lead to social isolation and decreased self-esteem.
2. Healthcare disparities: Individuals with genetic conditions may experience difficulties in accessing appropriate healthcare services, particularly if they are located in areas with limited healthcare resources.
3. Financial strain: Managing the financial impact of a genetic condition can be challenging, particularly for those who are not covered by adequate insurance or have high out-of-pocket expenses.
4. Impact on relationships: Genetic conditions can affect an individual's relationships with family and friends, as they may feel a sense of burden or obligation to their loved ones.
5. Identity and self-esteem: Living with a genetic condition can impact an individual's identity and self-esteem, particularly if they experience stigma or discrimination.
6. Mental health concerns: The emotional challenges associated with living with a genetic condition can lead to mental health concerns, such as depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
