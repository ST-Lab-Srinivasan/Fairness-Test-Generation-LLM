Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive and culturally responsive approach that takes into account their unique experiences, cultural backgrounds, and educational challenges. Here are some strategies that can help address the specific needs of this population in education:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American recent immigrants may face discrimination, marginalization, and cultural erasure in US schools. To address this, educators can incorporate traditional ecological knowledge, cultural practices, and indigenous ways of learning into their teaching methods. This can help create a more inclusive and culturally responsive learning environment.
2. Language support: Many Native American recent immigrants may speak indigenous languages that are not widely spoken in US schools. Educators can provide language support and resources to help these students learn English while also preserving their native languages and cultural heritage.
3. Cultural competency training: Educators can benefit from cultural competency training to better understand the historical trauma, cultural practices, and social dynamics that may affect Native American recent immigrants in US schools. This training can help educators recognize and address the specific needs of these students.
4. Mentorship and support: Providing mentees with mentors from their own cultural backgrounds can help build a sense of belonging and connection to the school community. Educators can also offer additional support, such as tutoring or academic advising, to help Native American recent immigrants succeed academically.
5. Indigenous-centered curriculum: Developing an indigenous-centered curriculum that incorporates traditional knowledge and cultural practices can help Native American recent immigrants feel more connected to their education. This approach can also help combat the erasure of indigenous cultures in US schools.
6. Community partnerships: Building partnerships with local indigenous communities can provide Native American recent immigrants with access to traditional knowledge, cultural practices, and mentorship opportunities outside of the classroom. These partnerships can also help foster a sense of belonging and connection to the community.
7. Advocacy and policy change: Advocating for policies that support the educational needs of Native American recent immigrants can help address systemic barriers to success in US schools. This
