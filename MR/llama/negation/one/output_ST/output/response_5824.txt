Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty Native natural-born US citizen students can be challenging due to various factors, including cultural and linguistic barriers, limited access to quality education, and unique learning styles. Here are some strategies that can help meet their educational needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching practices: Train teachers on culturally responsive teaching practices to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for Native students. This includes understanding the cultural backgrounds of students, using culturally relevant materials, and incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum.
2. Indigenous language immersion programs: Develop Indigenous language immersion programs that provide opportunities for students to learn their native languages and cultures. These programs can help students develop a strong sense of identity and connection to their communities.
3. Personalized learning plans: Create personalized learning plans that take into account the unique needs and preferences of each student. This can include adapting curricula, providing additional support, and offering alternative assessment methods to accommodate different learning styles.
4. Community partnerships: Foster partnerships between schools and local Native communities to provide students with opportunities for experiential learning and cultural enrichment. This can include field trips, guest speakers, and community service projects that align with the curriculum.
5. Technology integration: Leverage technology to support personalized learning and bridge the gap between traditional and modern learning methods. This can include using educational apps, online resources, and virtual reality tools to enhance student engagement and understanding.
6. Professional development for teachers: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about culturally responsive teaching practices, Indigenous curriculum design, and the unique needs of Native students. This can help teachers better understand and address the educational needs of their students.
7. Student leadership and voice: Empower Native students to take an active role in their education by providing opportunities for student leadership and voice. This can include creating student-led clubs, participating in decision-making processes, and developing cultural programs that promote student engagement and achievement.
8. Family and community involvement: Encourage family and community involvement in students' educational journey by providing opportunities for parents and guardians to learn about the curriculum, attend school events
