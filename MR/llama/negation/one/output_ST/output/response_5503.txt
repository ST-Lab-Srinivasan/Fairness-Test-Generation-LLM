Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-time married beginner Spanish speaker individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society. For individuals who have been married for a long time and are learning Spanish, their cultural heritage can influence their language learning process and their identities as learners.
