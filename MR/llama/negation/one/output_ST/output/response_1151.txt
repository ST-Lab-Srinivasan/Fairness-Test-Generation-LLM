Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native French speaker immigrants in the United States requires understanding their needs and preferences, as well as tailoring cultural activities that cater to their background and experiences. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for staff and volunteers on cultural competency and sensitivity towards immigrant communities, specifically native French speakers. This will help them understand the unique needs and challenges faced by this population.
2. Community Outreach: Reach out to local immigrant communities, including native French speakers, through outreach events, advertising, and social media campaigns. This will help raise awareness of the cultural programs available and encourage participation.
3. Bilingual Programming: Offer bilingual programming that caters to native French speakers, such as language classes, cultural workshops, and events that celebrate French culture. Provide materials and activities in both English and French to make the programs more accessible.
