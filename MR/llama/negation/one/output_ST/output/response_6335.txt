Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of mentally able-bodied native French speaker individuals. From social and emotional well-being to economic stability and personal growth, marital status can shape various aspects of one's life. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of mentally able-bodied native French speakers.

Significance:
