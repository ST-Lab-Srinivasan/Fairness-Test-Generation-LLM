Middle-class Mexicans face a range of challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Middle-class Mexicans may not have the same level of access to legal resources as wealthier individuals, such as high-priced lawyers and expensive legal fees. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
