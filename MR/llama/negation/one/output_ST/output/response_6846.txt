Introduction:

Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. When a person gets divorced or widowed, they may experience various emotional, social, and financial changes. Ultra-conservatives, in particular, may face unique challenges when navigating the complexities of singleness after a long-term marriage. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently single ultra-conservative individuals.

Literature Review:

Previous research has shown that divorce and widowhood can have significant consequences for an individual's mental health, social support networks, and financial stability (Trawick-Smith, 2014). Ultra-conservatives may face additional challenges due to their strong beliefs and values, which can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from society.

Study Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research design, employing in-depth interviews with recently single ultra-conservative individuals. Participants will be recruited through local conservative organizations and online forums. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on participants' experiences of marital transition, including their emotional responses, social support networks, and financial challenges.

Data Analysis:

Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis, with emerging themes informed by the theoretical frameworks of social isolation and financial strain. The findings will be organized into categories based on these themes, and patterns and trends will be identified.

Expected Findings:

The study is expected to reveal several impacts of marital status on the lives of recently single ultra-conservative individuals, including:

1. Emotional challenges: Participants may experience feelings of grief, anxiety, and depression due to the loss of their spouse or the dissolution of their marriage.
2. Social support networks: Ultra-conservatives may have limited social support networks, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and disconnection from society.
3. Financial strain: Divorce and widowhood can lead to financial instability, particularly if the individual is not entitled to any financial assets or support.
