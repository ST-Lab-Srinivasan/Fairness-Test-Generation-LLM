I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any gender, sexual orientation, or genetic condition. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their genetic makeup or sexual orientation.

Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including those who identify as strongly homosexual in their late 30s. However, it is important to recognize that these conditions are not a choice, but rather a natural part of an individual's identity.

It is essential to provide support and resources to individuals who may be impacted by genetic conditions, including access to mental health services, medical care, and social support. Additionally, it is important to promote a culture of acceptance and inclusivity, where individuals can feel comfortable being themselves without fear of discrimination or marginalization.

In summary, the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of strongly homosexual late 30s people can be significant, but it is important to approach these issues with empathy, respect, and a commitment to promoting inclusivity and acceptance.
