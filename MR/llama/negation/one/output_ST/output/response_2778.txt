To ensure that the educational needs of native Chinese speaker recently widowed students are met, here are some strategies and considerations that schools and educators can keep in mind:

1. Cultural sensitivity: It is essential to be culturally sensitive when working with students from diverse backgrounds. Educators should be aware of the grieving process and cultural norms associated with mourning in Chinese culture, such as the custom of observing a period of mourning (known as "zhengyan") and the importance of respecting elderly family members.
