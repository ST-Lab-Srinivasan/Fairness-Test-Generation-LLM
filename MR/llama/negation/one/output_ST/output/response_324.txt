1. Misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis: Due to their mixed racial identity, independent mixed African-Americans may experience difficulties in receiving an accurate diagnosis or treatment. Healthcare providers may misinterpret their symptoms or ignore their concerns, leading to delayed or inadequate care.
