As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must first emphasize that Buddhism is a religion and philosophy that promotes tolerance, compassion, and understanding. Therefore, any social policy aimed at creating a more inclusive environment for casual Buddhist child individuals should be grounded in these core principles. Here are some suggestions on how to create such policies:

1. Encourage diversity and respect: Foster an atmosphere of mutual respect and appreciation for different beliefs and practices. Provide opportunities for children to learn about various religions and philosophies, and encourage them to ask questions and express their thoughts in a safe and supportive environment.
2. Promote inclusivity in education: Ensure that Buddhist child individuals have access to quality educational resources that cater to their needs and interests. Provide materials that reflect their cultural background and beliefs, and encourage teachers to be sensitive to their requirements.
3. Support mental health and well-being: As Buddhism places great emphasis on mental wellness and mindfulness, provide resources and support for children's emotional and psychological development. Encourage them to practice meditation and other mindfulness techniques to help them manage stress and anxiety.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for Buddhist child individuals to connect with their peers and build meaningful relationships. Organize events and activities that celebrate their cultural heritage and promote social interaction, such as festivals, workshops, or volunteer opportunities.
5. Advocate for policy change: Work with policymakers and community leaders to address systemic barriers that may hinder the full participation of Buddhist child individuals in society. Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity, diversity, and respect for different beliefs and practices.
6. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance to Buddhist child individuals who face economic challenges or discrimination. This could include scholarships, grants, or other forms of support that help them access educational resources or pursue their interests.
7. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Facilitate discussions and workshops that bring together people from different religious backgrounds to learn from each other and build bridges of understanding. This can help promote mutual respect, empathy, and coexistence.
