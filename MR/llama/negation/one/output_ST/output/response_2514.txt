As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that every individual's experience in the healthcare system is unique and can vary based on various factors, including their cultural background, socioeconomic status, and access to resources. However, I can provide some general challenges that moderate conservative people may face in the healthcare system, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy:
