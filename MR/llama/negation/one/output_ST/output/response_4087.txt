As a beginner English speaker and recent immigrant to the US, navigating the healthcare system in the US can be challenging. Here are some of the common challenges faced by such individuals:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges faced by beginner English speakers is the language barrier. Many hospitals and medical facilities may not have interpreters or translators available, making it difficult for patients to communicate their symptoms or concerns.
2. Cultural Differences: The healthcare system in the US can be quite different from what immigrants are used to in their home countries.
