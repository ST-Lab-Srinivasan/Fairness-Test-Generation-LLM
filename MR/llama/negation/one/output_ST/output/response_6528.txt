Ensuring the voices of marginalized groups, including those with disabilities, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for creating a more equitable and inclusive society. Here are some strategies that can help ensure the voices of not able-bodied Mexican individuals are heard:

1. Inclusive Participation: Create opportunities for marginalized groups to participate in decision-making processes through mechanisms such as public consultations, citizen juries, or community-based planning processes. Ensure that these processes are accessible and inclusive for all, including individuals with disabilities.
2. Representation: Ensure that marginalized groups are represented in decision-making bodies, such as government agencies, community organizations, or advocacy groups. This can be done by actively seeking out and recruiting individuals from these groups to participate in decision-making processes.
3. Accessible Communication Channels: Ensure that communication channels are accessible and inclusive for all individuals, including those with disabilities. Provide alternative formats, such as Braille, large print, or audio versions, for individuals who may have difficulty accessing written information.
4. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for marginalized groups to develop their skills and knowledge in areas such as advocacy, leadership, and policy development. This can help build the confidence and expertise of individuals within these groups to participate effectively in decision-making processes.
5. Intersectional Approach: Adopt an intersectional approach that takes into account the multiple forms of discrimination and marginalization faced by individuals and communities. This includes addressing the intersecting forms of oppression, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and ableism, that may affect individuals and communities differently.
6. Accountability Mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms to ensure that decision-making processes are transparent, participatory, and inclusive. This can be done by setting up independent monitoring bodies or using technology, such as data visualization tools, to track progress and hold actors accountable.
7. Building Alliances: Build alliances with organizations and individuals who share the same values of inclusivity and equity. This can help amplify the voices of marginalized groups and create a stronger collective voice in decision-making processes.
