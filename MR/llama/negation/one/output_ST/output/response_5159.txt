Creating more inclusive housing policies for reservist slightly old (50s) individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this age group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize the value of older reservists: Older reservists have extensive experience and skills that can benefit their communities. Housing policies should recognize and value their contributions, rather than viewing them as a burden on society.
2. Provide flexible housing options: Reservist slightly old individuals may have changing needs when it comes to housing. Policies should offer flexible options such as age-restricted communities, co-housing, or shared living spaces that cater to their needs.
