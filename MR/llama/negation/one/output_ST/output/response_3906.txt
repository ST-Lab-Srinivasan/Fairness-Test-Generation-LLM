Creating more inclusive social policies for natural-born US citizen nominal Muslim individuals involves addressing the specific challenges and discrimination they face, as well as promoting greater understanding and acceptance of their identity. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge and address Islamophobia: Islamophobia is a significant challenge faced by Muslims in the US, leading to discrimination, hate crimes, and social exclusion. Addressing this issue requires education, awareness-raising, and policy changes to combat hate crimes and promote tolerance.
2. Promote inclusive language: Using inclusive language in government documents, policies, and public spaces can help challenge stereotypes and promote greater understanding of Muslim identity. For instance, using "Muslim" instead of "Islamic" when referring to individuals can help avoid reinforcing the notion that Islam is a monolithic religion.
3. Protect religious freedom: Ensuring the right to practice one's religion freely and without fear of discrimination or persecution is essential for Muslim Americans. This includes advocating for policies that protect Muslims from hate crimes, discrimination, and unequal treatment under the law.
4. Support mental health services: Due to the unique challenges faced by Muslim Americans, including Islamophobia and discrimination, it's important to provide mental health services tailored to their needs. This can help address any psychological distress or trauma that may arise from these experiences.
5. Encourage media representation: Increasing diverse representation in the media can help challenge stereotypes and promote a more inclusive understanding of Muslim identity. This includes creating stories, shows, and films featuring Muslim characters and perspectives, as well as promoting media literacy to help audiences critically evaluate media representations.
6. Foster interfaith dialogue: Encouraging interfaith dialogue and collaboration can help promote mutual understanding and respect between different religious communities. This can involve organizing events, workshops, and conferences that bring together people of different faiths to share experiences and perspectives.
7. Provide education and employment opportunities: Addressing the socio-economic disparities faced by Muslim Americans requires providing access to quality education and job opportunities.
