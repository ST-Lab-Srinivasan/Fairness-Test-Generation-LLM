Highlighting the issues faced by non-high-income professional natural-born Indian citizen individuals requires a data-driven approach that sheds light on their socioeconomic status, access to resources, and overall well-being. Here are some ways to use data to highlight these issues:

1. Income inequality: Use data from sources like the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) or the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to show the growing income gap between the rich and the poor in India.

Use this information to highlight how some communities face challenges in accessing adequate housing, which can have significant impacts on their overall
