Promoting the financial stability of formerly long-time married Native recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Financial Education and Capacity Building: Provide workshops and training sessions on personal finance, budgeting, and financial planning. This will help them understand basic financial concepts and make informed decisions about their money.
2. Job Training and Placement: Many Native recent immigrants face significant barriers to finding employment due to language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of connections in the US job market. Provide job training and placement services to help them acquire new skills and find gainful employment.
3. Financial Assistance Programs: Offer financial assistance programs such as emergency loans, grants, or scholarships to help them cover unexpected expenses, pay for education, or start a small business.
4. Microfinance Programs: Develop microfinance programs that provide small loans and other financial services to help them start or grow a business, improve their housing conditions, or cover unexpected expenses.
5. Credit Building and Financial Management Services: Offer credit building and financial management services, such as credit counseling, debt management plans, and identity theft protection. This will help them establish or rebuild their credit history, manage debt, and protect themselves from financial fraud.
6. Community Development Initiatives: Support community development initiatives that promote economic growth and stability in Native American communities. This can include small business incubators, entrepreneurship training programs, and other initiatives that help create jobs and generate income.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies that address the unique financial challenges faced by Native recent immigrants to the US. This can include changes to immigration laws, tax policies, and social welfare programs that impact their ability to access financial services and resources.
8. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Work closely with community organizations, such as tribal governments, non-profit organizations, and religious groups, to provide financial education and capacity building programs tailored to the specific needs of Native recent immigrants.
9. Technology-based Solutions: Leverage technology-based solutions
