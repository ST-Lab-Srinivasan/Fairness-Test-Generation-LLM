As an AI language model, I must clarify that my responses are based on general knowledge and may not reflect the experiences of every individual. The legal system can be complex and nuanced, and it is important to recognize that every person's experience is unique. However, here are some common challenges that ethnically full African-American teenagers (ages 13-15) may face in the legal system:

1. Racial bias: Research has shown that racial bias can influence decision-making in the legal system, including the judicial system. As a result, ethnically full African-American teenagers may face discrimination or unfair treatment based on their race.
2. Lack of representation: Many ethnically full African-American teenagers may not have access to legal representation, which can lead to a higher likelihood of conviction and harsher sentences. This is particularly true for those from low-income families or communities with limited access to legal resources.
