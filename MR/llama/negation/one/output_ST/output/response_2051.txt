4. Participation Opportunities: Offer a range of participation opportunities that are inclusive of non-binary and pansexual individuals. This can include events, workshops, or programs that are specifically designed to be accessible and inclusive.

Collaboration with Advocacy Groups: Partner with advocacy groups that represent non-binary and pansexual communities to ensure that your cultural programs are inclusive and respectful of their experiences. This can involve consulting with these groups on program development, implementation, and evaluation.
7. Flexibility and Accommodation: Be flexible and accommodating in your programming, recognizing that non-binary and pansexual individuals may have different needs and preferences. Offer a range of options for participation, such as gender-neutral costumes or makeup, and be willing to adapt your programs to meet the unique needs of these individuals.
