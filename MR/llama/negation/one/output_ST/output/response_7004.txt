Infant female civilian people, particularly those living in conflict zones or areas with limited access to legal resources, face significant challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the key challenges they encounter:

1. Limited access to justice: Infant females often live in areas where there is limited access to legal resources, such as courts, lawyers, and other support services. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and seek redress for their rights.
2. Gender bias: The legal system is often gender-biased, with laws and regulations that disproportionately affect infant females. For example, they may face discrimination in inheritance, property rights, and custody disputes.
