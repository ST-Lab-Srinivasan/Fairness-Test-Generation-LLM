Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Newly Married Beginner English Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly married beginner English speakers. This study aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals, particularly in the context of language acquisition and usage. By examining the relationship between cultural heritage and identity formation, this research can provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of identity construction and language learning among newly married beginner English speakers.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage significantly influences an individual's identity formation (Hall, 1985; Giddens, 1991). Cultural heritage encompasses the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions of a particular group or society. It can shape an individual's sense of self and influence their language usage, including their proficiency in English (Kramsch, 1993).

Newly married beginner English speakers are particularly susceptible to the impact of cultural heritage on their identities due to the significant life changes they experience. Marriage often involves a shift from one's pre-marital identity to a new post-marital identity that incorporates aspects of one's partner's culture (Komaki & Kamata, 1986). This transition can lead to a reevaluation of one's cultural heritage and its relevance to their identity.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach using in-depth interviews with newly married beginner English speakers. Participants will be recruited through purposive sampling, selecting individuals who are within the first two years of marriage and have limited proficiency in English. The interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes related to cultural heritage and identity formation.

Expected Outcomes:
The findings of this study are expected to highlight the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of newly married beginner English speakers. Specifically, we can expect to see how participants' cultural backgrounds shape their language usage, including their proficiency in English, and how they navigate their new marital identity within the context
