Nigeria is a country with a diverse population, and Islam is one of the major religions practiced there. However, despite the large number of Muslims in Nigeria, the legal system has historically been shaped by Western legal traditions and principles, which can create challenges for Nigerian Muslims in their interactions with the law. Here are some of the challenges faced by Nigerian nominal Muslim people in the legal system:

1. Lack of Islamic law training for judges and legal practitioners: Many judges and legal practitioners in Nigeria have not received training in Islamic law, which can lead to a lack of understanding of the principles and practices of the religion. This can result in misinterpretation or misunderstanding of Islamic law, leading to unfair outcomes for Muslims in legal proceedings.
2. Limited recognition of Islamic law: Nigeria's legal system is based on common law, which gives more weight to judicial precedent and tradition than to religious texts. This can make it difficult for Muslims to have their rights recognized and protected under the law, particularly when dealing with issues that are governed by Islamic law.
3. Limited representation in the legal profession: The legal profession in Nigeria is dominated by non-Muslims, which can limit the opportunities for Muslims to participate fully in the legal system. This can lead to a lack of representation and voice for Muslims in legal matters that affect them directly.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, there have been instances of discrimination and bias against Muslims in Nigeria's legal system. This can manifest in various ways, such as unequal treatment under the law or unfair judgments.
5. Lack of Islamic law resources: There is a lack of Islamic law resources in Nigeria, including textbooks, journals, and other materials. This can make it difficult for Muslims to access information and guidance on how to navigate the legal system as a Muslim.
6. Limited awareness of Islamic law: Many Muslims in Nigeria may be unaware of their rights and obligations under Islamic law, particularly if they have not received adequate education or training in the subject. This can lead to them being taken advantage of or exploited in legal matters.
7. Limited access to Islam
