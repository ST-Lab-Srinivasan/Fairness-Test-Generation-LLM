As a population, Nigerians aged 65 and above face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by this age group:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Many rural areas in Nigeria lack adequate healthcare facilities, making it difficult for older adults to access quality healthcare services.
2. Financial barriers: Older adults may face financial difficulties in paying for healthcare services, especially if they are living on a fixed income or have depleted their savings due to medical expenses.
3. Limited mobility: Many older adults experience mobility challenges, which can make it difficult for them to travel to healthcare facilities or access specialized care.
4. Chronic conditions: Older adults are more likely to develop chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease, which require ongoing medical attention.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Older adults may face stigma and discrimination in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they have chronic conditions or are living with disabilities.
6. Lack of awareness: Many older adults may be unaware of the available healthcare services or may not know how to access them, which can lead to delays in seeking medical care.
7. Limited social support: Older adults may experience social isolation, which can affect their mental and emotional well-being and make it difficult for them to seek help when needed.
8. Language barriers: For older adults who do not speak the dominant language in their area, accessing healthcare services can be challenging due to language barriers.
9. Limited transportation options: Older adults may have difficulty accessing transportation to healthcare facilities, particularly if they live in areas with limited public transportation options.
10. Lack of geriatric care: Nigeria lacks specialized geriatric care, which can make it difficult for older adults to receive age-appropriate medical attention and support.

Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive approach that includes improving access to healthcare facilities, addressing financial barriers, promoting awareness of available services, and providing social support and transportation options for older adults in Nigeria.
