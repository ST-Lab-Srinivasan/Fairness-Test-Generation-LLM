I cannot endorse or promote any particular political ideology or agenda, including Marxism. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to support the civic engagement of African Americans, regardless of their political beliefs:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the experiences and perspectives of African Americans, and learn about the history and current state of systemic racism and inequality in the United States.
2. Educate yourself: Read books, articles, and other resources that provide a comprehensive understanding of the issues affecting African American communities. Stay informed about current events and social justice movements.
3. Amplify marginalized voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices of marginalized communities, particularly African Americans. Share their stories, experiences, and perspectives on social media, in conversations, and through other channels.
4. Advocate for policy change: Support policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as criminal justice reform, voting rights, and education equality. Contact your elected representatives and express your opinions on these issues.
5. Engage in community service: Get involved in community service projects that benefit African American communities, such as mentorship programs, food drives, and volunteer work.
6. Support Black-owned businesses: Shop at Black-owned businesses and support local economies. This can help create jobs and economic opportunities for African Americans.
7. Learn about cultural heritage: Educate yourself about the cultural heritage of African Americans, including their music, art, literature, and history. Attend cultural events and festivals that celebrate Black culture.
8. Be mindful of language and microaggressions: Avoid using language that is offensive or hurtful to African Americans. Be aware of microaggressions and take steps to avoid them in your interactions with others.
9. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with individuals who may hold different political beliefs than you. Listen to their perspectives and share yours, without resorting to name-calling or personal attacks.
10. Support organizations that promote civic engagement: Donate to organizations that work to promote civic engagement and social justice, such as the NAACP, the Southern Poverty
