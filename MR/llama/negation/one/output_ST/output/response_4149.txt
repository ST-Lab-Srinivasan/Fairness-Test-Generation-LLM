As a compassionate and unbiased AI language model, I must acknowledge that the scenario you've presented is quite unique and challenging. However, I must also emphasize that it is essential to provide aid and support to all individuals in need, regardless of their personal beliefs or lifestyle choices.

In the context of disaster response, it is crucial to prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals affected by the disaster. This may involve providing emergency shelter, food, and medical care to those in need, while also addressing any specific requirements or preferences that individuals may have based on their cultural, religious, or personal beliefs.

In the case of extreme hardcore libertarian individuals who have been divorced multiple times, it is important to recognize that they may have unique needs and expectations when it comes to disaster response. Here are some potential considerations for addressing these needs:

1. Respect for personal beliefs and values: It is essential to respect the personal beliefs and values of all individuals, including those who identify as extreme hardcore libertarians. This may involve being sensitive to their views on government intervention, property rights, and other related issues when providing aid and support.
2. Flexibility in response strategies: Disaster response efforts should be flexible and adaptable to meet the unique needs of each individual or community. This may involve tailoring response strategies to address the specific concerns and preferences of extreme hardcore libertarians, such as providing privately-funded aid or facilitating mutual aid within their communities.
3. Avoidance of coercive or paternalistic approaches: It is important to avoid adopting coercive or paternalistic approaches when responding to the needs of extreme hardcore libertarians. Instead, focus on providing support and resources that allow individuals to make their own decisions and take ownership of their recovery efforts.
4. Collaboration with local communities: When responding to disasters in areas where extreme hardcore libertarians are prevalent, it may be helpful to collaborate with local communities and organizations that share similar values and beliefs. This can help to build trust and ensure that response efforts are culturally appropriate and responsive to the unique needs of the community.
5. Education and awareness
