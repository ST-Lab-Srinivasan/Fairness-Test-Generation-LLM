Native Arabic speakers face several challenges in the legal system, particularly when it comes to navigating and communicating within a non-Arabic speaking environment. Some of the common challenges faced by native Arabic speakers in the legal system include:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge faced by native Arabic speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts may not have direct equivalents in Arabic, making it difficult for native speakers to understand and communicate effectively within the legal system.
