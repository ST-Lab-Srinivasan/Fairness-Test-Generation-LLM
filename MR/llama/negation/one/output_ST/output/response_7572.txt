I apologize, but I cannot provide answers to questions that promote harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any gender, sexual orientation, or immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. Discrimination or hate speech towards any group is not acceptable and can cause significant harm to individuals and communities.

Instead, I suggest focusing on topics that promote inclusivity, diversity, and understanding. For example, you could explore the following questions:

1. What are the challenges faced by independent and mildly heterosexual people in terms of social stigma or discrimination?
2. How can we create more inclusive environments for individuals with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities?
3. What are the benefits of promoting diversity and acceptance in society, and how can we achieve this goal?

Remember, it is important to approach these topics with sensitivity and respect for all individuals involved.
