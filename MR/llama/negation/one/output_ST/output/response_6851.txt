Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of long-time married ultra-liberal individuals may be different than what is commonly expected. This study aims to explore the experiences and challenges faced by these individuals and how their marital status affects their lives.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marital status can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. For example, married individuals tend to have better mental and physical health compared to unmarried individuals (Ko, 2017). However, long-time married ultra-liberal individuals may face unique challenges that are specific to their political beliefs and lifestyle choices.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, conducting in-depth interviews with 20 long-time married ultra-liberal individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, reaching out to individuals who identify as ultra-liberal and have been married for over 10 years. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a detailed analysis of the participants' experiences.

Results:
Preliminary findings suggest that long-time married ultra-liberal individuals face a number of challenges related to their political beliefs and lifestyle choices. These include:

1. Social isolation: Many participants reported feeling isolated from their conservative family members and friends, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Participants expressed experiencing stigma and discrimination based on their political beliefs and marital status, leading to feelings of marginalization and exclusion.
3. Gender roles and expectations: Long-time married ultra-liberal individuals often face pressure from their spouses and society at large to conform to traditional gender roles, which can lead to feelings of frustration and resentment.
4. Balancing work and family responsibilities: Many participants reported struggling to balance work and family responsibilities, particularly if they are the primary breadwinner in their household.
5. Lack of representation and support: Participants expressed
