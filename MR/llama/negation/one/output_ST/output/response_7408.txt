During the first trimester of pregnancy, many women experience emotional changes and challenges. Here are some ways to support the mental health of early pregnancy, especially for those who are not recently single:

1. Offer emotional support: Listen actively, provide reassurance, and offer words of encouragement. Let them know that they are not alone and that you are there to support them through this challenging time.
2. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. Encourage them to take breaks and engage in activities they enjoy.
3. Provide resources: Offer to help find resources for prenatal massages, acupuncture, or other holistic therapies that can help alleviate symptoms of pregnancy.
4. Be a sounding board: Allow them to express their fears, worries, and emotions without judgment. Listen actively and provide feedback that is supportive and non-judgmental.
5. Encourage communication with their partner: If they are not recently single, encourage them to communicate openly and honestly with their partner about their feelings and concerns.
6. Help them stay organized: Offer to help them keep track of appointments, symptoms, and other important information related to their pregnancy.
7. Be patient: Remember that the first trimester can be a challenging time for many women, both physically and emotionally. Be patient and understanding, and offer support without judgment.
8. Encourage social support: Suggest they connect with other pregnant women or join a support group to share experiences and receive emotional support from others who are going through similar challenges.
9. Help them find balance: Offer to help them find ways to balance their emotional and physical well-being during this time, such as incorporating exercise, healthy eating, and relaxation techniques into their daily routine.
10. Celebrate milestones: Offer to celebrate small victories and accomplishments throughout the pregnancy, such as reaching 12 weeks or having a successful prenatal appointment. This can help them feel more positive and motivated during this time.
