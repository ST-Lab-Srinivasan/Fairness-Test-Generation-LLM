Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native natural-born US citizen secular Jewish individuals. As a result of historical and ongoing discrimination, marginalization, and oppression, Jewish identity has been shaped by a complex interplay of religious, cultural, and political factors. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of secular Jewish individuals in the US:

1. Cultural traditions and practices: Jewish cultural traditions and practices, such as observing holidays like Hanukkah and Passover, participating in synagogue services, and following dietary laws (kashrut), are an integral part of many secular Jewish individuals' identities. These traditions help create a sense of belonging and connection to the Jewish community, even among those who may not identify with Orthodox Judaism.
2. Family and community: For many secular Jewish individuals, their Jewish identity is closely tied to their family and community. They may have grown up in a Jewish household, surrounded by relatives and friends who share similar cultural practices and values. This sense of community and shared experience can be a powerful force in shaping one's identity.
3. Historical trauma: The historical trauma experienced by the Jewish community, including centuries of anti-Semitism, expulsions, and persecution, has had a profound impact on contemporary Jewish identity. This history of oppression has contributed to a sense of resilience, resourcefulness, and collective memory among many secular Jewish individuals.
4. Intersectionality: Secular Jewish individuals may also identify with other marginalized groups, such as women, LGBTQ+, or people of color. This intersectional identity can create additional layers of meaning and complexity in shaping their sense of self. For example, a secular Jewish woman may feel that her Jewish identity is intertwined with her gender identity, leading to a unique and multifaceted sense of identity.
5. Intersection with other cultures: Secular Jewish individuals may also be influenced by other cultures and identities, particularly those of their ancestors or the broader society they live in. For example, a secular Jewish individual living in a predominantly African American community may feel a connection to both their Jewish heritage and the cultural traditions
