Low-earning national people in many countries face significant challenges when accessing and receiving quality healthcare. Some of the common challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Low-income individuals may live in areas with limited access to healthcare facilities, making it difficult for them to receive timely and appropriate care.
2. Cost of healthcare services: Even if there are healthcare facilities nearby, low-earning individuals may not be able to afford the cost of services, including consultation fees, medication, and hospital stays.
3. Limited availability of specialized care: Low-income individuals may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiology, oncology, or neurology, due to a lack of specialists in their area or the high cost of these services.
4. Long wait times: Low-income individuals may experience long wait times for appointments and procedures, which can exacerbate their health problems and lead to poor health outcomes.
5. Limited availability of preventive care: Low-earning individuals may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of health problems.
6. Language barriers: Individuals with low incomes may face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, which can hinder their ability to communicate their symptoms and concerns effectively.
7. Transportation challenges: Low-income individuals may have limited access to transportation, making it difficult for them to get to healthcare facilities, especially in rural or remote areas.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Low-earning individuals may face stigma and discrimination when seeking healthcare services, which can affect their mental and physical health.
9. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be culturally sensitive to the needs of low-income individuals from diverse backgrounds, leading to inadequate care and poor health outcomes.
10. Lack of patient education: Low-income individuals may have limited access to patient education resources, which can hinder their ability to manage their health conditions and make informed decisions about their care.
