Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and access to resources. The first trimester of pregnancy is a critical period in which the developing fetus is highly vulnerable to environmental factors, making it essential to assess the potential effects of immigration status on the well-being of pregnant individuals, particularly those who are not recently divorced.

Literature Review:
Several studies have investigated the impact of immigration status on mental and physical health outcomes during pregnancy. For instance, a study conducted by Al-Zir et al. (2019) found that undocumented immigrant women were more likely to experience depression and anxiety during pregnancy compared to documented immigrant women. Similarly, another study by Gortmaker et al. (2004) revealed that low-income immigrant women had higher rates of gestational diabetes and hypertension than their U.S.-born counterparts.

Social relationships can also be affected by immigration status during pregnancy. A qualitative study by Rodriguez et al. (2018) found that undocumented immigrant women experienced social isolation due to fear of deportation and lack of access to healthcare resources, which could have negative consequences for their mental and physical well-being during pregnancy.

Access to resources is another crucial factor influenced by immigration status during pregnancy. Studies have shown that undocumented immigrants face barriers in accessing prenatal care, including language barriers, lack of health insurance, and fear of discrimination (e.g., Al-Zir et al., 2019; Rodriguez et al., 2018). These challenges can result in delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have adverse effects on both the mother and the developing fetus.

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample population will consist of 100 pregnant women who are not recently divorced and have varying immigration statuses (i.e., documented or undocumented). Data
