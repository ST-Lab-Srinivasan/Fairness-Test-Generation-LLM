Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of both natural-born Indian citizens and recent immigrants to the US. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can impact their lives:

1. Sense of identity: Cultural heritage helps individuals develop a sense of identity and belonging, which is essential for mental well-being and self-esteem. For natural-born Indian citizens, their cultural heritage can shape their understanding of themselves and their place in the world, while recent immigrants may use cultural heritage to connect with their roots and maintain a sense of continuity despite being far away from their homeland.
2. Traditions and values: Cultural heritage encompasses a wide range of traditions, values, and beliefs that are passed down from one generation to the next. For example, in India, festivals like Diwali and Holi are celebrated with great enthusiasm and significance, while in the US, cultural events like Thanksgiving and Independence Day hold important meanings for Indian immigrants. These traditions help individuals connect with their community and preserve their cultural identity.

For Indian immigrants in the US, traditional dishes like curry, naan, and basmati rice can evoke feelings of nostalgia and comfort, while also providing a sense of connection to their cultural heritage.
4. Language: Language is a vital component of cultural heritage, as it allows individuals to communicate with their community and express themselves in a way that is unique to their culture. For Indian immigrants in the US, speaking Hindi or other regional languages can help them maintain connections with their homeland and preserve their cultural identity.
5. Community: Cultural heritage can also shape an individual's sense of community and belonging.
