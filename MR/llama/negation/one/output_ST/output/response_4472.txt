I apologize, but I cannot provide information that promotes or advocates for discrimination or marginalization of any particular group, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. Everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is important to recognize that diversity and inclusivity are essential for a healthy and thriving society, and that everyone has the right to contribute and participate fully.

It is not appropriate to use language that is offensive or hurtful to any group of people. Using terms like "openly strongly homosexual" can be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and contributing to a culture of discrimination and marginalization. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Instead of focusing on the sexual orientation or gender identity of individuals, it is more important to recognize the unique perspectives and experiences that they bring to the table. By valuing diversity and promoting inclusivity, we can create a society that is more equitable and just for everyone.
