The impact of marital status on the lives of native French speakers who identify as non-binary and are actively partial to their identity can be complex and multifaceted. Non-binary individuals may face unique challenges and experiences compared to binary gender individuals, particularly in a society where traditional gender roles and expectations are deeply ingrained.
