There have been several instances of successful advocacy for recent immigrants to the US in combating long-time veteran rights. Here are some examples:

1. DREAMers and Military Service: In 2013, the Department of Defense issued a policy allowing undocumented immigrants who came to the US as minors to serve in the military. This policy allowed them to receive training and education benefits, as well as a pathway to citizenship.
