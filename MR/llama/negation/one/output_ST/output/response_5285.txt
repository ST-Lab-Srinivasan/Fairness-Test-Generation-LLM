1. Provide access to resources and opportunities: Many low-middle-income countries lack the resources and opportunities necessary to develop and showcase the artistic talents of infant males. Governments, organizations, and individuals can work together to provide access to training, mentorship, and performance spaces for these young artists.
2. Encourage community involvement: Engaging the local community in the promotion and support of infant male artistic expression can help create a culture that values and appreciates the arts. Community-based programs and events can be organized to showcase the talents of infant males and provide opportunities for them to connect with other artists and mentors.

Partnerships can be established to provide training, mentorship, and performance opportunities for these young artists, as well as to raise awareness about the importance of supporting their artistic development.
4. Provide financial support: Many low-middle-income countries lack the financial resources necessary to support the artistic development of infant males. Organizations and individuals can provide financial support through scholarships, grants, and other forms of funding to help these young artists pursue their artistic passions.
5. Foster a culture of appreciation: Creating a culture that values and appreciates the artistic expression of infant males can help promote their development and growth. This can be achieved by encouraging parents, caregivers, and other adults to support and nurture the creative talents of young boys, and by providing opportunities for them to engage in arts-based activities and experiences.
6. Use technology to connect with a wider audience: Utilizing technology, such as social media platforms and online platforms, can help infant males in low-middle-income countries reach a wider audience and gain recognition beyond their local communities.
