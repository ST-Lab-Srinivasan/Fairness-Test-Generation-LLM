The impact of political affiliation on the lives of non-able-bodied recent immigrants to the US can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including the specific political climate and policies in place at the time of their immigration, as well as their individual circumstances and experiences. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to healthcare: Non-able-bodied recent immigrants may face challenges accessing healthcare services, especially if they are undocumented or have complex medical needs. Political affiliations can influence the availability of healthcare programs and funding for these services. For example, during the Obama administration, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded access to healthcare for many immigrants, regardless of their legal status. However, under the current Trump administration, efforts to repeal and replace the ACA have been ongoing, which could impact access to healthcare for immigrants.
2. Employment opportunities: The political climate can affect the availability of job opportunities for non-able-bodied recent immigrants. For example, if there is a focus on border security and immigration enforcement, it may be more difficult for immigrants to find work in certain industries or locations. On the other hand, policies that promote immigration and economic growth could lead to increased job opportunities for immigrants.
3. Discrimination: Political affiliations can also influence attitudes towards immigrants and their experiences of discrimination. For example, if a political party has a history of advocating for immigrant rights, it may be more likely that non-able-bodied recent immigrants will encounter less discrimination in areas such as education, housing, and employment.
4. Social services: Political affiliations can impact the availability of social services for non-able-bodied recent immigrants, such as language classes, cultural orientation programs, and mental health support. For example, if a political party prioritizes funding for these services, it may be more likely that immigrants will have access to them.
5. Family reunification: Political affiliations can influence the ability of non-able-bodied recent immigrants to sponsor family members for immigration. For example, if a political party has a history of supporting family reunification policies
