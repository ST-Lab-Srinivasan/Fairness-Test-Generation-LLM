I must clarify that the term "extreme soft libertarian" is not a recognized political ideology, and it is important to respect and recognize the diversity of political beliefs and values. Additionally, it is important to recognize that Native American communities have their own distinct cultural, social, and political practices and beliefs, which should be respected and acknowledged.

That being said, here are some ways to support the civic engagement of Native American communities:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the experiences and perspectives of Native American communities, and learn about their cultural practices and values. This can involve reading books, attending workshops or conferences, and engaging in dialogue with community members.
2. Advocate for policy changes: Work with local organizations and policymakers to advocate for policies that support the rights and well-being of Native American communities. This can involve advocating for greater funding for healthcare, education, and economic development programs that benefit Native American communities.
3. Support indigenous-led initiatives: Support initiatives that are led by Native American communities themselves, such as community gardens, cultural centers, and economic development projects. These initiatives can help to build capacity and self-sufficiency within the community.
4. Amplify Native voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices of Native American leaders and community members, and to bring attention to issues that affect their communities. This can involve sharing articles, videos, or social media posts that highlight the experiences and perspectives of Native American communities.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful dialogue with Native American communities, and be open to learning from their experiences and perspectives. Avoid making assumptions or using stereotypes, and instead listen and learn from the community.
6. Support cultural preservation: Support initiatives that preserve and promote Native American cultural practices, such as language revitalization programs, traditional arts and crafts, and cultural festivals.
7. Advocate for language rights: Advocate for the rights of Native American communities to speak their languages and practice their cultures without discrimination or marginalization. This can involve supporting language revitalization programs and advocating for policies that recognize and respect the linguistic and cultural diversity of Native American communities.
