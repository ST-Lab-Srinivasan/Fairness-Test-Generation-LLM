Ensuring that the healthcare needs of low-income Mexican individuals are met is a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Expand access to health insurance: Many low-income Mexicans lack access to health insurance, which can limit their ability to receive necessary medical care. Governments and private organizations could work together to provide affordable health insurance options to these individuals.
2. Increase funding for public health services: Governments could invest more resources into public health services, such as clinics and hospitals, to ensure that low-income individuals have access to quality medical care.
3. Implement community-based healthcare models: Community-based healthcare models, such as mobile clinics or house calls, can help reach low-income populations that may have difficulty accessing traditional healthcare facilities.
4. Promote preventive care: Many low-income individuals may delay seeking medical care until they have a severe illness or injury. Promoting preventive care through education and outreach programs could help identify health issues earlier and reduce the need for costly interventions later on.
5. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants, such as poverty, education level, and living conditions, can have a significant impact on an individual's overall health. Addressing these factors through policies and programs that promote economic mobility and improved living conditions could help improve health outcomes for low-income populations.
6. Develop partnerships with NGOs and local organizations: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and local community groups often have a deep understanding of the specific healthcare needs of low-income communities. Developing partnerships with these organizations can help ensure that healthcare efforts are tailored to meet the unique needs of these populations.
7. Provide mental health services: Mental health issues are prevalent in low-income communities, and addressing them can have a significant impact on overall health outcomes. Providing accessible mental health services could help reduce stress and improve well-being among low-income individuals.
8. Utilize technology: Telemedicine and other digital health technologies can help expand access to medical care for low-income populations, particularly those living in remote or
