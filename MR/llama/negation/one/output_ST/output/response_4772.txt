Title: Exploring the Intersection of Cultural Heritage and Identity among Mixed-Caucasian Heritages Orthodox Jewish Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed-Caucasian heritage Orthodox Jewish individuals. This group faces a unique identity crisis due to their dual membership in two distinct cultural groups. Through a qualitative study, we aim to understand how these individuals navigate and reconcile their multiple identities.

Theory:
We draw on the theory of identity formation (Hall, 1990) and intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1989) to analyze the complex interplay between cultural heritage and identity. We argue that cultural heritage serves as a primary source of identity for these individuals, but it also creates tensions and conflicts when combined with their religious affiliation.

Methods:
We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 mixed-Caucasian heritage Orthodox Jewish individuals in the United States. Participants were selected through purposive sampling to ensure a diverse range of experiences and perspectives. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
Our findings reveal three key themes: (1) navigating cultural identities, (2) reconciling religious and cultural identities, and (3) embracing multiple identities. Participants grappled with the tension between their Caucasian heritage and Orthodox Jewish identity, often feeling caught between two competing worlds. Many participants experienced discrimination or prejudice within their own communities, leading to feelings of isolation or exclusion. However, they also found support and belonging within their religious community.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the complex interplay between cultural heritage and identity among mixed-Caucasian heritage Orthodox Jewish individuals. By examining the ways in which these individuals navigate and reconcile their multiple identities, we gain insight into the challenges and opportunities of belonging to two distinct cultural groups. Our findings underscore the importance of acknowledging and valuing diversity within religious communities, fostering inclusivity and respect for all members, regardless of their cultural background.
