Promoting the educational success of Native American recent immigrants to the US can be a complex and challenging task, as these students often face significant barriers to academic achievement. However, there are several strategies that educators and policymakers can implement to support these students' educational success:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American recent immigrants may have different cultural backgrounds and learning styles than their peers in the US. Educators can adopt culturally responsive teaching practices, which involve recognizing and valuing the diversity of students' cultural backgrounds and incorporating elements of those cultures into instructional strategies.
2. Language support: Many Native American recent immigrants may speak indigenous languages in addition to English. Educators can provide language support services, such as bilingual education programs or language interpretation services, to help these students communicate more effectively in the classroom.
3. Cultural and identity-based academic support: Native American recent immigrants may face discrimination and marginalization based on their cultural identity. Educators can provide cultural and identity-based academic support, such as mentorship programs or peer support groups, to help these students feel more connected and supported in their academic pursuits.
4. Addressing trauma: Many Native American recent immigrants may have experienced trauma related to violence, displacement, or discrimination in their home countries or during their migration to the US. Educators can provide mental health support services, such as counseling or therapy, to help these students manage their emotional and psychological well-being.
5. Building relationships: Building positive relationships between educators and Native American recent immigrant students is critical for promoting academic success. Educators can engage in cultural exchange activities, such as traditional music or dance performances, to help build bridges of understanding and respect between different cultural groups.
6. Providing academic support: Native American recent immigrants may face challenges related to academic language and literacy skills, as well as difficulties with the US educational system. Educators can provide targeted academic support services, such as tutoring or remedial classes, to help these students catch up with their peers.
7. Advocating for policy change: Native American recent immigrants may face systemic barriers to education
