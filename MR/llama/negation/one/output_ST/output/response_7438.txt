Nigeria is a predominantly Muslim and Christian country, with Islam being the official religion of the country. However, there is also a significant number of atheists and non-believers in the country. Despite the Constitution of Nigeria providing for freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, atheist individuals in Nigeria still face several challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by Nigerian strong atheists:

1. Lack of legal recognition: Atheism is not recognized as a legitimate philosophical or religious perspective in Nigeria's legal system. As a result, atheists do not have the same legal protections and rights as religious individuals.
2. Blasphemy laws: Nigeria has blasphemy laws that criminalize any act or statement considered offensive to any religion. Atheists have been arrested and prosecuted under these laws for expressing their atheist views.
3. Discrimination: Atheists in Nigeria often face discrimination and social exclusion, particularly in conservative communities where religious beliefs are deeply ingrained. This can make it difficult for atheists to access education, employment, and other opportunities.
4. Intolerance: Nigerian society is generally intolerant of atheist views, and there is a widespread perception that atheism is immoral or unpatriotic. This can lead to social ostracism, harassment, and violence against atheists.
5. Limited access to education: Many atheists in Nigeria face limited access to education due to the country's religiously-biased education system. This can result in a lack of understanding and acceptance of atheist perspectives among the general population.
6. Lack of legal support: Atheists in Nigeria often have limited access to legal support and resources, particularly in rural areas where there may be no legal aid services available.
7. Stigma and social exclusion: Atheists in Nigeria may face stigma and social exclusion, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization. This can make it difficult for atheists to access healthcare, education, and other basic rights.
8. Limited political representation: Atheists in Nigeria have limited political representation
