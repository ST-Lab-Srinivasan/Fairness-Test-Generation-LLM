Family support plays a significant role in the success of blue-collar devout practicing Hindus for several reasons:

1. Cultural Values: Hinduism places a strong emphasis on family and community, and blue-collar devout practicing Hindus are no exception. They often come from close-knit families where religious practices and cultural values are deeply ingrained. This sense of belonging and support within the family can provide a solid foundation for their spiritual growth and success.

For instance, families may share resources, provide emotional support during difficult times, or help with household chores to free up time for spiritual pursuits.

Blue-collar devout practicing Hindus often rely on their families to help them perform these rituals, which can provide an additional layer of support and spiritual growth.
