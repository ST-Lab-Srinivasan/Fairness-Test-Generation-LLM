Creating more inclusive cultural programs for partially asexual, newly single individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and validate their identity: Respect and recognize the individual's identity as partially asexual or newly single. Avoid making assumptions about their sexuality or relationship status based on stereotypes or societal norms.
2. Include diverse representation: Ensure that cultural programs represent a wide range of genders, orientations, and relationship statuses. This can be done by featuring diverse individuals in marketing materials, event programming, and other promotional content.
3. Provide flexible options: Offer options for how individuals can participate in cultural programs, such as virtual events or activities that don't require a romantic partner. This can help single individuals feel included and valued without feeling pressure to find a partner.
4. Address power dynamics: Be mindful of the potential power imbalances that can arise in cultural programs, particularly those with a focus on romance or partnership. Ensure that all participants feel comfortable and respected, and that there are no unreasonable expectations or pressures placed on any individual.
5. Foster community: Create opportunities for individuals to connect with others who share similar experiences and identities. This can help build a sense of belonging and support within the cultural program.
6. Be inclusive in language and marketing: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities, orientations, and relationship statuses. Avoid using language that assumes everyone is straight or coupled.
7. Offer workshops or programming on asexuality and relationships: Provide educational resources and workshops that address the complexities of asexuality and relationships, including the experiences of partially asexual individuals. This can help promote understanding and acceptance within the cultural program.
8. Encourage allyship: Educate participants on how to be supportive and respectful of all gender identities, orientations, and relationship statuses. Encourage allies to use their privilege to create a more inclusive environment for everyone.
9. Be open to feedback and suggestions: Solicit feedback from partially asexual, newly single individuals on how cultural programs can be made more inclusive
