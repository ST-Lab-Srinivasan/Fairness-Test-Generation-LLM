Promoting the inclusion of Native American natural-born US citizens in casual athletics can be achieved through a multi-faceted approach that addresses both systemic barriers and individual biases. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Awareness and Education: Raise awareness about the historical and ongoing discrimination faced by Native American communities, and the importance of inclusion in athletics. Provide education and training on cultural sensitivity, diversity, and inclusion for coaches, athletic directors, and other stakeholders.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Ensure that sports facilities and programs are culturally sensitive and responsive to the needs of Native American communities. This can include incorporating traditional Native American sports and games into programming, and involving Native American community members in decision-making processes.
3. Outreach and Partnerships: Develop partnerships with Native American communities and organizations to promote inclusion and create opportunities for participation. Collaborate with tribal leaders, schools, and community groups to identify needs and develop solutions.
4. Scholarships and Financial Support: Provide financial support and scholarships to Native American athletes to help them participate in sports programs. This can include funding from the government, foundations, or private donors.
5. Mentorship and Leadership Opportunities: Offer mentorship and leadership opportunities to Native American athletes to help them develop skills and confidence. This can include providing coaching, training, and support to help them succeed in their chosen sports.
6. Infrastructure and Resources: Ensure that sports facilities and programs are accessible and inclusive for Native American communities. Provide resources such as equipment, uniforms, and transportation to help remove barriers to participation.
7. Policy Changes: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels to promote inclusion and address systemic barriers. This can include changes to athletic policies, funding priorities, and legislation that promotes diversity and inclusion in sports.
8. Community Engagement: Engage with Native American communities through outreach and engagement activities. This can include hosting cultural events, providing information about athletic opportunities, and listening to community feedback to identify needs and develop solutions.
