Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are experiencing deep poverty, particularly those who have been recently divorced multiple times, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Data collection and analysis: Collect data on the demographics, income levels, and living conditions of individuals experiencing deep poverty, including those who have been recently divorced multiple times. Analyze the data to identify patterns and trends, which can inform policy decisions.
2. Identify the root causes of poverty: Addressing the root causes of poverty is crucial in creating more inclusive policies. Some of the factors that contribute to poverty include lack of access to education and job opportunities, discrimination, and social isolation. Policies should aim to address these underlying issues.
3. Provide access to education and job training: Education and job training programs can help individuals gain the skills and knowledge they need to secure better-paying jobs and escape poverty. Policies should prioritize investment in these areas, particularly for individuals who have been recently divorced multiple times.
4. Implement a living wage policy: A living wage is the amount of money needed to meet basic needs, such as housing, food, and healthcare. Policies should aim to ensure that all individuals have access to a living wage, regardless of their marital status or number of times they have been divorced.
5. Address discrimination: Discrimination based on marital status or previous divorces can limit access to social services and opportunities for economic mobility. Policies should aim to address this discrimination by promoting equal access to resources and opportunities.
6. Foster community connections: Social isolation can exacerbate the effects of poverty. Policies should prioritize building community connections and social support networks, particularly for individuals who have been recently divorced multiple times.
7. Provide mental health support: The process of divorce can be emotionally challenging, and the effects of trauma can last long after the divorce is finalized. Policies should prioritize providing mental health support services to individuals experiencing deep poverty, particularly those who have been recently divorced multiple times.
