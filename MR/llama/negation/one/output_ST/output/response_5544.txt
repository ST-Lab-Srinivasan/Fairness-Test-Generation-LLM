Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of Native American and other recent immigrants to the United States who identify as transgender after transitioning or undergoing hormone therapy. These individuals may face unique challenges related to their gender identity, including cultural and societal barriers, discrimination, and health disparities. This report aims to provide an overview of the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of these individuals and identify potential solutions to address these issues.

Impacts of Genetic Conditions:
Native American and recent immigrant transgender individuals may face a range of genetic conditions that can affect their health and well-being. These conditions can include:

1. Hormone resistance: Some individuals may experience hormone resistance, which can make it difficult to achieve the desired hormone levels for gender confirmation surgeries or hormone therapy. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including virilization (the development of male characteristics) in trans women or feminization (the development of female characteristics) in trans men.
2. Genetic mutations: Genetic mutations can cause a range of health problems, including infertility, autoimmune disorders, and increased risk of certain cancers. These conditions can be particularly challenging for transgender individuals who may face discrimination and stigma related to their gender identity.
3. Increased risk of mental health issues: Transgender individuals are at higher risk of experiencing mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, due to the discrimination and stigma they face. This can be particularly true for Native American and recent immigrant transgender individuals who may face additional cultural and societal barriers.
4. Difficulty accessing healthcare: Transgender individuals may face difficulties accessing healthcare, including gender-affirming surgeries and hormone therapy, due to a lack of knowledgeable providers, inadequate insurance coverage, or discrimination by healthcare professionals. This can lead to delayed or incomplete care, which can negatively impact an individual's quality of life.
