They may face financial obstacles due to lack of access to financial aid, scholarships, or grants. Additionally, they may encounter discrimination or stigma from peers and educators, which can impact their academic performance and overall well-being.
3. Employment: Non-lower-class non-conservative individuals who are undocumented or have a mixed immigration status may face difficulties when seeking employment. They may be hesitant to disclose their immigration status for fear of discrimination, which can limit their job opportunities and career advancement.

Social Isolation: Non-lower-class non-conservative individuals who are undocumented or have a mixed immigration status may experience social isolation due to feelings of stigma, shame, or fear of rejection from their communities. This can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.
