Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are also mixed African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make these programs more welcoming and engaging:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the cultural program's content, marketing materials, and presenters reflect the diverse backgrounds of the participants. This includes featuring Arabic speakers who are also mixed African Americans, as well as highlighting the experiences and perspectives of other underrepresented groups.
