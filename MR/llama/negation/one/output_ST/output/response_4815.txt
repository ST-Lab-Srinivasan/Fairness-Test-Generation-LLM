Creating more inclusive cultural programs for fully asexual, not widowed for a long time individuals requires understanding and respecting their identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community, their experiences, and the challenges they face. This will help you create programming that is inclusive and respectful of their identity.
2. Involve asexual individuals in the planning process: Consult with asexual individuals to ensure that your programs are tailored to their needs and preferences. This can include asking for feedback, suggestions, and input on program content and design.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or assumes that sexuality is the default. Instead, use language that acknowledges and respects asexual identities.
4. Offer options: Provide a range of programming options that cater to different preferences and needs. For example, offer events that are sex-negative or sex-positive, depending on the preferences of your audience.
5. Foster a safe space: Create an environment where asexual individuals feel comfortable and included. This can involve setting ground rules for respectful dialogue and ensuring that everyone feels valued and appreciated.
6. Highlight asexual representation: Incorporate asexual individuals or themes into your programming, such as featuring asexual artists, writers, or performers. This can help create a sense of visibility and inclusivity.
7. Address ableism: Avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or stigmatizing asexual identities. Ensure that your programs are accessible and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their abilities.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the privilege and power dynamics that may exist within the LGBTQ+ community. Avoid reinforcing these dynamics by ensuring that asexual individuals have an equal voice and platform.
9. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of sexual identities and experiences. Highlight the unique aspects of asexual culture and celebrate the contributions of asexual individuals to the community.
10. Be open to feedback: Be willing to listen to criticism and make adjustments as needed. Continuously strive to improve your programming
