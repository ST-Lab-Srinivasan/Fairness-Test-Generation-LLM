As a native French speaker and lifelong single person, there are several challenges that I have faced in the job market. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Stereotypes and biases: Unfortunately, there are still many stereotypes and biases against singles in the workplace. Many people assume that singles are not as committed to their jobs or are less reliable than their married counterparts.
