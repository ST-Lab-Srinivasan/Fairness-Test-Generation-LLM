Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Time Married Beginner French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those who have been married for a long time and are learning a new language like French. In this study, we aim to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of long-time married beginner French speakers. Specifically, we will examine the relationship between cultural heritage and language acquisition, as well as how cultural heritage affects the learners' sense of self and identity.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on language acquisition and identity formation (Kramsch, 1993; Taguchi, 2007). For instance, research has shown that individuals from collectivist cultures tend to prioritize group identity over individual identity when learning a new language (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988). Similarly, learners from cultures with strong gender roles may exhibit different language learning behaviors and attitudes compared to those from more egalitarian societies (Kiraly, 2014).

Methodology:
We will recruit 30 long-time married beginner French speakers who are aged 50 or older. Participants will complete a demographic questionnaire and a language proficiency test to ensure they meet the criteria for our study. We will then administer a series of psychological assessments, including the Identity Formation Scale (Gurin, 1999) and the Language Learning Attitudes Inventory (LLAI; Horwitz, 1986), to measure participants' sense of self and language learning attitudes. Finally, we will conduct semi-structured interviews to gather more in-depth data on how cultural heritage influences learners' language acquisition and identity formation.

Results:
Our results indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-time married beginner French speakers. Participants from collectivist cultures tended to prioritize group identity over individual identity when learning French, while those from more individualistic cultures focused on personal
