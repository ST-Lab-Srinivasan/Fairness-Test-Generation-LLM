Ensuring that the voices of native English speakers and recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for creating a more inclusive and equitable society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Access: Provide language access services such as interpretation, translation, and bilingual staff to ensure that non-English speakers have equal access to information and opportunities. This can be done through government agencies, community organizations, or by providing these services directly to individuals.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training for decision-makers and service providers to help them understand the diverse needs and experiences of immigrant communities. This can include training on issues such as language barriers, cultural norms, and the impact of trauma on mental health.
3. Community Engagement: Foster community engagement and participation in decision-making processes through mechanisms such as community meetings, focus groups, and surveys. This can help ensure that the voices of immigrant communities are heard and their perspectives are taken into account.
4. Advocacy Groups: Support advocacy groups that represent the interests of immigrant communities. These groups can provide a platform for individuals to voice their concerns and advocate for policies that benefit their communities.
