6. Promote work-life balance: Encourage married individuals to prioritize their personal well-being and work-life balance by providing resources like counseling services, mental health support, or on-campus fitness classes.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of your student body, including those who are married, by creating a culture of inclusivity and respect for different backgrounds and experiences.
8. Offer career guidance: Provide career counseling and job placement services to help married individuals navigate their professional goals and aspirations.
9. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage married students to connect with older
