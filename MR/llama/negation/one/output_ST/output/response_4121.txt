Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants, particularly those from extreme or moderate liberal backgrounds, in India can be challenging due to cultural and societal differences. However, here are some ways to support their integration:

1. Language classes: Providing language classes specifically tailored for recent immigrants can help them navigate everyday situations and communicate effectively with locals.
2. Cultural orientation programs: Organizing cultural orientation programs that introduce the local customs, traditions, and values can help immigrants better understand the social dynamics of India.
3. Social events: Hosting social events that bring together immigrants and locals can foster dialogue and mutual understanding, helping to break down barriers and build connections.
4. Community outreach programs: Developing community outreach programs that engage immigrants in local activities, such as volunteering or participating in sports teams, can help them feel more connected to the community.
5. Mentorship initiatives: Establishing mentorship initiatives that pair recent immigrants with experienced individuals from the host society can provide guidance and support during their transition.
6. Advocacy and awareness campaigns: Launching advocacy and awareness campaigns to promote diversity and inclusion can help create a more welcoming environment for immigrants.
7. Education and training: Providing education and training programs tailored to the needs of recent immigrants can help them acquire new skills and knowledge, enhancing their employability and social integration.
8. Legal support: Offering legal support and advice can help immigrants navigate the complex Indian legal system, ensuring they are aware of their rights and responsibilities.
9. Healthcare services: Providing access to healthcare services specifically designed for recent immigrants can help address any medical concerns or issues they may face during their transition.
10. Online platforms: Creating online platforms that connect immigrants with resources, information, and each other can facilitate communication and networking, making it easier for them to navigate their new surroundings.
11. Community centers: Establishing community centers specifically designed for immigrants can provide a safe and inclusive space for them to socialize, access support services, and engage in activities that promote integration.
