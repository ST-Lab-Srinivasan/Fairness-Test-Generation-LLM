Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of non-disabled individuals after their spouse's death. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Loss of legal status: If the deceased spouse was the primary breadwinner and held a visa or green card, the surviving spouse may lose their legal status in the US upon their spouse's death. This can lead to difficulties in maintaining their immigration status and may result in deportation proceedings.
2. Financial instability: The deceased spouse was often the primary financial supporter of the family, leaving the surviving spouse without a steady income source. This can create significant financial challenges, particularly if the surviving spouse is not working or has limited financial resources.
3. Loss of health insurance: If the deceased spouse provided health insurance coverage, the surviving spouse may lose their coverage upon their death. This can be especially problematic for individuals with ongoing medical needs or disabilities.
4. Emotional distress: The loss of a spouse can be emotionally devastating, particularly if the couple was married for a long time or had children together. The surviving spouse may experience depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges as they navigate their new life without their partner.
5. Social isolation: The loss of a spouse can lead to social isolation, particularly if the couple was the primary social unit. The surviving spouse may find themselves with fewer social connections and support systems, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and isolation.
6. Difficulty navigating legal systems: Non-disabled individuals who are not fluent in English or have limited legal knowledge may struggle to navigate the complex US immigration system, particularly if they are dealing with issues related to their spouse's death. This can lead to difficulties in obtaining the necessary documentation and support to maintain their immigration status.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Non-disabled individuals who are immigrants or have limited legal status may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, employers, and other members of society. This can lead to difficulties in accessing healthcare services, finding employment, and maintaining their overall well-being.
