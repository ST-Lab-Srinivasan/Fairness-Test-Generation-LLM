Creating more inclusive community events for Nigerian adults in their late 30s can be achieved by considering the following factors and taking practical steps:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct research to identify the interests, hobbies, and lifestyles of Nigerian adults in their late 30s. This will help you tailor the events to meet their needs and preferences.
2. Provide diverse entertainment options: Offer a variety of activities such as cultural performances, sports, games, and workshops that cater to different interests and age groups. This can help create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and involved.
3. Promote accessibility: Ensure that the events are accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and Braille materials.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for attendees to participate in decision-making processes, volunteer, or take on leadership roles. This can help foster a sense of ownership and belonging among participants.
5. Foster intergenerational connections: Organize events that bring together people of different age groups, such as mentorship programs, cultural exchange events, or community service projects. This can help build bridges between generations and create a more cohesive community.
6.

9. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an atmosphere that encourages participants to connect with one another and feel a part of the community. This
