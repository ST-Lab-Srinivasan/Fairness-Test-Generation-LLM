As a beginner English speaker and a native natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

Legal terminology and concepts can be complex and difficult to understand, especially if you are not proficient in English. This can make it hard to navigate the legal system and understand your rights and responsibilities.
