Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of physically disabled individuals, particularly those in the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Disabled individuals may face barriers when accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health programs, but their immigration status could make it challenging to receive the necessary care.
2. Employment and Financial Stability: Disabled individuals may encounter difficulties finding employment or earning a living wage due to discrimination, limited job opportunities, or lack of access to education and training. Their immigration status can exacerbate these challenges, making it harder for them to support themselves and their families.
3. Social Isolationation: Disabled individuals may experience social isolation, particularly if they are undocumented. They may be reluctant to seek help or connect with others due to fear of deportation or discrimination. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
4. Education and Training: Disabled individuals may face obstacles when pursuing education or training opportunities due to their immigration status. They may be ineligible for financial aid or scholarships, or they may be subject to discrimination based on their immigration status.
5. Housing Insecurity: Disabled individuals may struggle with housing insecurity, particularly if they are undocumented. They may face difficulties finding affordable and accessible housing, which can further exacerbate their disability-related challenges.

7. Lack of Advocacy: Disabled individuals who are undocumented may face a lack of advocacy and support from mainstream disability organizations. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can further impact their well-being.
8. Discrimination: Disabled individuals may experience discrimination based on their immigration status, particularly in the healthcare system. They may be subject to language barriers,
