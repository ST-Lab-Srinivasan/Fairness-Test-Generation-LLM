Creating more inclusive cultural events for temporary visa holders, particularly those who lean right, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct research to learn more about the preferences and needs of temporary visa holders who lean right. This could include understanding their cultural backgrounds, interests, and expectations from cultural events.
2. Offer diverse programming: Provide a range of cultural events that cater to different tastes and preferences. This could include events that showcase traditional music, dance, art, or literature from various cultures. Make sure the events are inclusive and welcoming to all attendees, regardless of their political views.
3. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural events are safe and inclusive for all attendees. This could involve providing clear guidelines on acceptable behavior, establishing a code of conduct, and having a plan in place for handling any incidents or conflicts that may arise.
4. Engage with the community: Reach out to local communities and engage with them through various channels. This could include partnering with local organizations, attending community events, or hosting cultural events in areas with high concentrations of temporary visa holders.
5. Offer language support: Provide translation services or interpretive support at cultural events to ensure that all attendees can fully participate and enjoy the event. This could involve hiring interpreters or providing headsets with pre-recorded translations.
6. Promote intercultural dialogue: Organize cultural events that facilitate dialogue and exchange between different cultures and communities. This could involve hosting panel discussions, workshops, or other interactive events that encourage attendees to share their perspectives and experiences.
7. Provide cultural orientation: Offer cultural orientation programs or resources for temporary visa holders to help them better understand the local culture and customs. This could involve providing information on local etiquette, traditions, and social norms.
8. Involve community leaders: Engage with local community leaders and organizers who have a deep understanding of the cultural nuances and preferences of temporary visa holders. They can provide valuable insights and help ensure that events are inclusive
