Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizens who are out of work are met is a critical issue, particularly in a country like India where there is a large population of marginalized and underprivileged communities. Here are some steps that can be taken to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to affordable healthcare: One of the primary challenges faced by out-of-work individuals is limited access to quality healthcare. To overcome this, the government can launch initiatives such as subsidized health insurance programs, free or low-cost health clinics, and mobile health vans that can reach remote areas.
2. Provide mental health support: Unemployment can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health, leading to stress, anxiety, and depression. To address this, mental health professionals can be deployed to provide counseling services, and hotlines can be set up for individuals to seek help in times of crisis.
3. Promote preventive care: Many out-of-work individuals may neglect their health due to financial constraints or lack of access to quality healthcare. To address this, the government can launch public awareness campaigns promoting preventive care, such as regular check-ups, vaccinations, and healthy lifestyle practices.
4. Encourage workplace wellness programs: Many organizations offer wellness programs that include on-site fitness classes, mental health services, and nutrition counseling. Encouraging these programs in workplaces can help out-of-work individuals access these services for free or at a reduced cost.
5. Create job opportunities in the healthcare sector: One of the most effective ways to address the issue is to create job opportunities in the healthcare sector, particularly in rural areas where access to quality healthcare is limited. This can include setting up hospitals, clinics, and health centers, as well as providing training and certification programs for individuals interested in pursuing careers in healthcare.
6. Provide financial assistance: Many out-of-work individuals struggle to afford healthcare services due to limited financial resources. To address this, the government can launch financial assistance programs, such as subsidies or grants, that can help cover medical expenses.
7. Foster partnerships
