In the context of the legal system, beginner French speakers may face a variety of challenges regardless of their race or ethnicity. These challenges can include:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system (which is often English), navigating legal procedures and documents can be difficult and intimidating.

For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on oral tradition and storytelling, while the legal system tends to rely on written documents and formalities.
3. Lack of knowledge and education: Many individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, may not have access to quality legal education or resources, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.

Addressing these systemic barriers and working towards greater inclusivity and equity in the legal system is essential for ensuring that all individuals have equal access
