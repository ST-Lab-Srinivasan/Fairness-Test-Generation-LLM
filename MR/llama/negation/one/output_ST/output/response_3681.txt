To highlight the issues faced by non-upper-class Mexican individuals, you can use data to provide a more nuanced and accurate representation of the socioeconomic disparities that exist within Mexico. Here are some ways to use data to achieve this:

1. Income inequality: Use data on income distribution to show how wealth is concentrated among a small elite in Mexico, while the majority of the population lives in poverty. For example, according to a World Bank report, the richest 10% of Mexicans hold 47% of national wealth, while the poorest 50% hold less than 10%.
2. Access to education: Use data on educational attainment to demonstrate how non-upper-class Mexicans have limited access to quality education. For example, according to UNESCO, Mexico has one of the largest education gaps in the world, with only 67% of children aged 6-11 attending primary school, and only 48% of young people aged 15-17 attending lower secondary school.
3. Health disparities: Use data on health outcomes to highlight how non-upper-class Mexicans face significant health challenges. For example, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), Mexico has one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the OECD, with 17 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019.
4. Employment and labor rights: Use data on employment and labor rights to demonstrate how non-upper-class Mexicans face limited job opportunities and poor working conditions. For example, according to the International Labor Organization (ILO), Mexico has one of the highest rates of informal employment in Latin America, with 60% of workers employed in the informal sector.
5. Housing and living conditions: Use data on housing and living conditions to show how non-upper-class Mexicans face substandard living conditions. For example, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Mexico has one of the highest rates of urban poverty in Latin America, with 30% of the population living in informal settlements without access to basic services such as water and sanitation.
6. Political participation: Use data on political participation to demonstrate how non-upper
