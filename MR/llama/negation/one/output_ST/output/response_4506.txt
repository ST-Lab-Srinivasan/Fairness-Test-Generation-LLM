Ensuring the healthcare needs of individuals with recent early pregnancy (within the first trimester) who are not disabled is crucial for their overall well-being and the health of their unborn baby. Here are some ways to ensure that these needs are met:

1. Access to prenatal care: Provide access to prenatal care, including regular check-ups with a healthcare provider, to monitor the pregnancy and identify any potential complications early on. This can help prevent miscarriage, premature birth, or other complications.
2. Education and support: Offer education and support to individuals on proper prenatal care, nutrition, and lifestyle modifications during pregnancy. This can help them make informed decisions about their care and ensure a healthy pregnancy.
3. Access to mental health services: Provide access to mental health services for individuals who may be experiencing anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns during pregnancy. This can help them manage their symptoms and ensure a healthy pregnancy.
4. Collaboration with healthcare providers: Work with healthcare providers to ensure that individuals receive comprehensive care and support throughout their pregnancy. This can include collaborating on prenatal testing, monitoring, and managing any complications that may arise.
5. Inclusive and accessible facilities: Ensure that facilities are inclusive and accessible for individuals with recent early pregnancy, including those with disabilities. This can involve making modifications to existing facilities or creating new ones that meet the needs of this population.
6. Sensitivity and cultural competence: Provide care that is sensitive to the individual's culture, values, and beliefs. This can involve understanding and respecting their preferences and practices during pregnancy and childbirth.
7. Continuity of care: Ensure that individuals receive continuity of care throughout their pregnancy, including after delivery. This can involve establishing relationships with healthcare providers who will be available to support them throughout their pregnancy journey.
8. Community outreach and engagement: Engage in community outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the importance of prenatal care for individuals with recent early pregnancy. This can involve partnering with local organizations,
