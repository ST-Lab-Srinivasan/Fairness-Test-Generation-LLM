Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout Christian lower-class individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Listen and understand: Start by listening to the perspectives and experiences of lower-class devout Christians. Understand their cultural background, values, and beliefs. This will help you design programs that are relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Involve community members: Involve lower-class devout Christians in the planning and execution of cultural programs. This can include involving them in decision-making processes, soliciting their feedback, and encouraging them to take on leadership roles.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or alienating. Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and beliefs.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create programs that foster a sense of belonging among lower-class devout Christians. This can involve creating spaces where they feel comfortable and included, such as cultural events or activities that celebrate their heritage.
5. Provide access to resources: Provide access to resources that can help lower-class devout Christians navigate the cultural landscape. This can include providing information on cultural events, offering language classes, or connecting them with other community members who share similar experiences.
6. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and collaboration between different religious groups. This can help promote mutual understanding and respect, and create a more inclusive and harmonious cultural environment.
7. Support marginalized communities: Support marginalized communities, including lower-class devout Christians, by advocating for their rights and well-being. This can involve advocating for policies that promote social justice and equality, and working to dismantle systems of oppression.
8. Create safe spaces: Create safe spaces where lower-class devout Christians can express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can involve creating physical spaces, such as community centers or cultural hubs, or virtual spaces, such as online forums or social media groups.
9. Celebrate diverse expressions of faith: Celebrate diverse expressions of faith and culture, including those of lower-class devout Christians. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or assumptions about their belief
