Creating more inclusive social policies for culturally Hindu infant females requires a nuanced understanding of the cultural and social norms that shape their lives. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Listen to the voices of marginalized communities: It is essential to listen to the voices of marginalized communities, including culturally Hindu infant females, to understand their needs and experiences. This involves engaging in participatory research and consultation processes that prioritize the perspectives of these communities.
2. Address patriarchal attitudes and practices: Many social policies perpetuate patriarchal attitudes and practices that marginalize women and girls. Policies should actively challenge these attitudes and practices, promoting gender equality and challenging harmful gender stereotypes.
3. Foster inclusive spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for culturally Hindu infant females to participate in decision-making processes. This can involve establishing diverse advisory groups or creating spaces for dialogue and collaboration.
4. Promote education and awareness: Educating communities about the importance of inclusive social policies can help challenge harmful attitudes and practices. Awareness campaigns can be used to promote gender equality and challenge discriminatory behaviors and beliefs.
5. Support community-led initiatives: Empowering local communities to develop their own solutions can help create more inclusive social policies. This involves providing resources and support for community-led initiatives that address the specific needs of culturally Hindu infant females.
6. Advocate for policy change: Advocating for policy change at the local, national, or international level can help address systemic barriers that marginalize culturally Hindu infant females. This involves working with policymakers and advocacy groups to promote policies that prioritize gender equality and inclusive social development.
7. Monitor progress: Regular monitoring of policy implementation and progress can help identify areas for improvement. This involves tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure the impact of policies on marginalized communities, including culturally Hindu infant females.
8. Engage in advocacy and activism: Advocating for policies that promote gender equality and inclusive social development can involve engaging in activism and advocacy efforts.
