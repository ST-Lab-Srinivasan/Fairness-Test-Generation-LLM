I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question as it can be sensitive and may vary depending on individual experiences and cultural context. However, I can offer some possible challenges that moderately ethnically full Asian people might face in the healthcare system based on existing research and studies:

1. Perceptions of discrimination: Moderately ethnically full Asian individuals may experience discrimination or bias in the healthcare system due to their racial identity. Studies have shown that Asian Americans, including those who are moderately ethnically full, face discrimination in various areas of life, including healthcare [1].
