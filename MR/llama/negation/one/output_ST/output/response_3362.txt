The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently married or newly parents can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Stress and Anxiety: The stress of navigating a complex immigration system, dealing with bureaucratic red tape, and worrying about the future can take a toll on mental health, particularly for those who are recently married or newly parents.
2. Limited Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care, including difficulty accessing preventive care, facing language barriers, and being afraid of discrimination.
3. Financial Insecurities: The cost of living in the US can be high, and undocumented immigrants may struggle to make ends meet, particularly if they are not eligible for certain benefits or have limited access to employment opportunities.
4. Social Isolationation: Undocumented immigrants may feel isolated from their communities, friends, and family due to fear of deportation, language barriers, and cultural differences.
5. Stigma and Discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may face discrimination and stigma in their daily lives, which can lead to feelings of shame, anxiety, and depression.
6. Limited Educational Opportunities: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking higher education due to their immigration status, including difficulties accessing financial aid, scholarships, and student loans.
7. Workplace Discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may face discrimination in the workplace, including unequal pay, limited job opportunities, and harassment.
8. Family Separation: In some cases, undocumented immigrants may be separated from their families due to deportation or detention, which can have long-lasting effects on mental health and well-being.
9. Fear of Deportation: The constant fear of deportation can lead to anxiety, stress, and a lack of trust in law enforcement and government institutions.
10. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to legal resources, including affordable legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complex immigration system.
