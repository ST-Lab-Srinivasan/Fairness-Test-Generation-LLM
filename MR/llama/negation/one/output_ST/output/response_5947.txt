I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to economically empower a specific racial or ethnic group. The concept of "ethnically full Caucasian" is not a recognized social or economic category, and any efforts to promote economic empowerment based on race or ethnicity would be discriminatory and unethical.

Instead, I suggest focusing on inclusive and equitable economic development strategies that benefit all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. This can involve policies and programs that promote access to education, job training, and entrepreneurship opportunities, as well as efforts to address systemic inequalities and discrimination in the economy.

It's important to recognize that economic empowerment is not solely determined by individual effort or merit, but also by structural factors such as access to resources, networks, and opportunities. Therefore, it's essential to address the broader social and economic context in which individuals operate, and to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive economy for all.
