Ensuring that the healthcare needs of marginalized communities, including Mexican non-upper-class people, are met is crucial for achieving equitable and inclusive healthcare systems. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural competency training for healthcare providers: Providing cultural competency training for healthcare providers can help them understand the unique needs and experiences of marginalized communities, including Mexican non-upper-class people. This can involve learning about the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of these communities and how they relate to healthcare.
2. Language accessibility: Ensuring that healthcare providers are fluent in the languages spoken by marginalized communities can help bridge the language barrier and improve communication between providers and patients. This can involve providing interpreters or translators, or training providers to communicate effectively with patients who speak different languages.
3. Community outreach and engagement: Engaging with marginalized communities through outreach and education efforts can help build trust and increase access to healthcare. This can involve partnering with community organizations, hosting health fairs, and providing educational materials in the language and format that is most accessible to the community.
4. Targeted interventions: Identifying and addressing the specific health disparities faced by marginalized communities can help ensure that their healthcare needs are met. For example, this may involve targeted interventions to address issues such as obesity, diabetes, or mental health concerns that disproportionately affect these communities.
5. Policy changes: Advocating for policy changes that address the social determinants of health can help reduce health disparities faced by marginalized communities. This may involve advocating for policies that address issues such as housing affordability, food security, and access to education, which are critical to promoting health equity.
6. Collaboration with community-based organizations: Partnering with community-based organizations that serve marginalized communities can help ensure that their healthcare needs are met. These organizations can provide culturally competent care, address social determinants of health, and provide access to healthcare services that may not be available through traditional healthcare systems.
7. Addressing systemic barriers: Identifying and addressing systemic barriers to healthcare access, such as discrimination
