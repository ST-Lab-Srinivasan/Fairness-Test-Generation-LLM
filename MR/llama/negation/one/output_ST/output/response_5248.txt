As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "ethnically full Hispanic" is not a recognized or appropriate term in the legal field. The term "Hispanic" refers to a person of Spanish-speaking origin or descent, but it does not necessarily imply that a person is of full or partial Hispanic ancestry.

Regarding the challenges faced by advanced aged (over 90 years old) ethnic minorities in the legal system, there are several issues that need to be addressed:

1. Ageism: Older adults may face age-based discrimination in the legal system, which can result in their rights and interests being neglected or ignored.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Older adults may have difficulty accessing legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and other services due to physical limitations, cognitive decline, or lack of transportation.
3. Difficulty understanding complex legal procedures: Older adults may struggle to understand complex legal terminology and procedures, which can lead to confusion and frustration.
4. Limited social support: Older adults may face social isolation and limited social support, which can impact their ability to navigate the legal system.
5. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system may not be equipped to address the unique needs and experiences of older adults from diverse cultural backgrounds.
6. Difficulty with technology: Older adults may have limited proficiency in using technology, which can make it difficult for them to access legal resources and services online.
7. Limited mobility: Older adults may have difficulty traveling to court hearings or other legal appointments due to physical limitations.
8. Limited financial resources: Older adults may face financial challenges that limit their ability to access legal services or pay for legal fees.
9. Difficulty with decision-making: Older adults may have difficulty making decisions due to cognitive decline, which can impact their ability to navigate the legal system.
10. Lack of trust in the legal system: Older adults may have a lack of trust in the legal system due to past experiences or perceived biases, which can make it difficult for them to seek legal help or access justice.
