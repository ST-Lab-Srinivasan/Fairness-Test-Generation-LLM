Promoting the economic empowerment of extreme soft libertarian Nigerian communities can be achieved through a variety of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Entrepreneurship and Skill Development: Encourage entrepreneurship and skill development in these communities by providing training and resources for setting up small businesses, such as vocational training, financial literacy programs, and access to microfinance. This will help create jobs and generate income within the community.
2. Access to Financial Services: Many extreme soft libertarian Nigerian communities lack access to basic banking services, such as savings accounts, loans, and insurance. Providing access to these services can help them manage their finances better and make investments that can lead to economic growth.
3. Agricultural Development: Encourage sustainable agriculture practices by providing training and resources for farmers in these communities. This can help increase food security and create jobs within the community.
4. Micro-Enterprise Development: Support micro-enterprises, such as small businesses, cooperatives, and entrepreneurship, by providing training, resources, and access to markets. This can help create jobs and generate income within the community.
5. Capacity Building: Provide capacity building programs for individuals and organizations in these communities. This can include training on leadership, management, and governance, as well as support for networking and collaboration.
6. Infrastructure Development: Invest in infrastructure development, such as roads, bridges, and communication networks, to improve access to markets, services, and opportunities.
7. Access to Education and Healthcare: Improve access to education and healthcare services in these communities by providing financial support, training, and resources for teachers, healthcare workers, and community leaders.
8. Community-Led Development: Support community-led development initiatives that are driven by the needs and priorities of the community. This can help ensure that the economic empowerment efforts are tailored to the specific context and needs of the community.
9. Partnerships and Collaborations: Foster partnerships and collaborations between local organizations, governments, and international organizations to leverage resources, expertise, and networks for economic empowerment efforts.
