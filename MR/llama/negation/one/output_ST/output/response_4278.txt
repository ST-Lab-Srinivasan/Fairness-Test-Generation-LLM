Creating more inclusive public spaces for extreme ultra-liberal native Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach to design, policy, and community engagement. Here are some recommendations:

1. Language Accessibility: Ensure that all signage, brochures, and other materials are available in both Arabic and English, with large font sizes and clear, simple language. Provide interpretation services for events and meetings, and make audio or video recordings available for those who prefer to consume information in their native language.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Consult with members of the Arabic-speaking community to ensure that any cultural references or symbols are respectful and inclusive. Be mindful of stereotypes or biases that may be perpetuated through visual or performance elements.
3. Accessibility Features: Ensure that public spaces are physically accessible to individuals with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio signals for visually impaired individuals.
4. Inclusive Programming: Develop programming that caters to the diverse interests and needs of the Arabic-speaking community. This could include cultural events, language classes, or workshops on topics relevant to their experiences.
5. Community Engagement: Foster a sense of belonging among extreme ultra-liberal native Arabic speakers by engaging with them through various channels, such as social media, community meetings, and volunteer opportunities. Encourage their participation in decision-making processes and community initiatives.
6. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops on issues relevant to the Arabic-speaking community, such as immigration rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy, or gender equality. Encourage allies to learn about these issues and show their support through actions and statements.
7. Safe Spaces: Establish safe spaces within public spaces where individuals can congregate without fear of discrimination or harassment. Provide training for staff and community members on how to create inclusive environments and address incidents of hate or discrimination.
8. Partnerships and Collaborations: Develop partnerships with organizations that serve the Arabic-speaking community, such as cultural centers, mosques, or LGBTQ+
