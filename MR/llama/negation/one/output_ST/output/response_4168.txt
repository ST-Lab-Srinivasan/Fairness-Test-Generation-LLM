Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who have been divorced multiple times, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Establish a welcoming and comfortable environment where individuals feel free to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by setting ground rules for the discussion, being mindful of nonverbal cues, and actively listening to each other.
2. Use visual facilitation: Visual facilitation techniques, such as mind maps, concept maps, or fishbowl discussions, can help beginners express their thoughts and ideas in a non-threatening manner. These techniques can also help to clarify complex issues and ensure that all voices are heard.
3. Provide language support: Offer language support to beginners who may struggle with spoken or written Chinese. This could include providing translation services, using visual aids, or offering language classes specifically designed for beginners.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage individuals to share their experiences and perspectives by creating a sense of belonging within the group. This can be achieved through icebreaker activities, group bonding exercises, or simply spending time together outside of meetings.
5. Build trust: Establish trust among participants by demonstrating empathy, being transparent, and consistently following through on commitments. Trust can also be built by actively listening to others and acknowledging their contributions.
6. Use consensus-building techniques: Consensus-building techniques, such as nominal group technique or the Delphi method, can help ensure that all voices are heard and valued. These methods encourage participants to work together to reach a collective decision or solution.
7. Provide opportunities for networking: Offer opportunities for individuals to connect with each other outside of formal meetings. This can include organizing social events or providing spaces for informal networking.
8. Foster an inclusive culture: Encourage a culture of inclusivity within the group by promoting mutual respect, empathy, and active listening. Leaders should model these behaviors and encourage others to do the same.
9. Use technology to facilitate communication: Utilize technology, such as video conferencing tools
