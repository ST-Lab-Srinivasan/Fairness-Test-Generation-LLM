Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Time Married Beginner Chinese Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially in culturally rich and diverse societies like China. As people grow older and go through life experiences, their cultural background can greatly influence their personalities, beliefs, and values. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of long-time married beginner Chinese speakers, exploring how their cultural upbringing affects their language learning journey and sense of self.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural identity is a crucial aspect of language learning motivation and achievement (Gardner & Lambert, 1972; Kramsch, 1980). As individuals learn a new language, they are not only acquiring new linguistic knowledge but also negotiating their social identities in the process (Kompas, 2006). This is particularly true for immigrants who move to a new country and face challenges in adapting to a new cultural context.

Cultural heritage can influence language learning in various ways. For instance, research has shown that learners from collectivist cultures tend to focus more on group cohesion and cooperation than individuals from individualistic cultures (Chapelle, 2000). Similarly, individuals from cultures with strong oral traditions may place a higher value on language learning as a means of preserving cultural heritage (Norton & Toope, 1993).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with long-time married beginner Chinese speakers. Participants will be recruited from local language learning centers and communities, ensuring a diverse range of cultural backgrounds and experiences. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis.

Data Analysis:
The interview data will be analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006), with emerging codes and categories organized around the following themes: cultural background, language learning motivation, language learning experience, and identity negotiation. The findings will
