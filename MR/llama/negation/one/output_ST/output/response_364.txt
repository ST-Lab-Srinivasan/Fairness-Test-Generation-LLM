I must clarify that the term "elderly male soft libertarian" is not a recognized demographic or identity category. Additionally, it is important to recognize that leadership development is not limited to any particular group or individual based on their age, gender, or political beliefs.

However, if you are interested in supporting the leadership development of individuals who identify as elderly men and who hold libertarian political views, here are some general suggestions:

1. Encourage them to engage in civic activities: Encourage them to participate in local politics, join advocacy groups, or volunteer for causes they are passionate about. This will help them develop leadership skills and gain experience in mobilizing others.
2. Provide mentorship opportunities: Pair them with experienced leaders who can provide guidance and support in developing their leadership skills. This could involve shadowing, coaching, or simply having informal conversations about leadership and politics.
3. Offer training and workshops: Organize workshops or training sessions on leadership skills such as communication, problem-solving, and decision-making. These can be delivered in-person or online, depending on the preferences of the individuals involved.
4. Facilitate networking opportunities: Encourage them to connect with other like-minded individuals and groups, both within their local community and beyond. This will help them build relationships and gain exposure to different perspectives and approaches to leadership.
5. Foster a culture of inclusivity and respect: Encourage these individuals to engage in respectful and inclusive dialogue with others, even when they disagree. This will help them develop their communication skills and learn how to work effectively with people from diverse backgrounds and beliefs.

It is important to recognize that leadership development is a lifelong process, and it requires ongoing effort and support. By providing these individuals with opportunities to engage in civic activities, receive mentorship, and participate in training and networking events, you can help them develop their leadership skills and make meaningful contributions to society.
