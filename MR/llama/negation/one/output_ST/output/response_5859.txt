The impact of marital status on the lives of beginner English speakers who identify as non-binary can be complex and varied. Non-binary individuals may face unique challenges in their romantic and marital relationships due to societal expectations and gender norms. Here are some potential impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner English speakers actively partially identifying as non-binary:

1. Internalized oppression: Non-binary individuals may internalize societal messages that their identity is invalid or less valuable than binary gender identities. This can lead to self-doubt, low self-esteem, and a lack of confidence in their identity. Marital status can exacerbate these feelings of internalized oppression if the non-binary individual experiences discrimination or marginalization within their marriage or romantic relationship.
2. Lack of support: Non-binary individuals may face a lack of support from their spouse or partner, which can impact their mental health and well-being. This can be particularly challenging in marital relationships where the non-binary individual may feel pressure to conform to traditional gender roles or expectations.
3. Invisibility: Non-binary individuals may feel invisible or overlooked within their marriage or romantic relationship, as their identity may not be recognized or validated by their partner. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from one's spouse or partner.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Non-binary individuals may face stigma and discrimination within their marital or romantic relationship, which can impact their mental health and well-being. This can be particularly challenging if the non-binary individual's partner is not supportive of their identity or if they experience harassment or bullying from their spouse or family members.

6. Gendered expectations: Non-binary individuals may face gendered expectations within their marital or romantic relationship, which can impact their mental health and well-being. For example, they may be expected to conform to traditional gender roles or expectations,
