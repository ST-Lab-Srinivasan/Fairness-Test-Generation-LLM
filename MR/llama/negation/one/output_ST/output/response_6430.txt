Instead of focusing on ways to support the civic engagement of one particular group, it's important to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society where all individuals have an equal voice and opportunity to participate. Here are some suggestions:

This can involve advocating for policies that address systemic inequalities, such as education reform, criminal justice reform, and voting rights.
4. Challenge your own biases and privileges: Recognize the ways in which you may benefit from systems of oppression and work to dismantle them. Use your privilege to amplify the voices of marginalized communities and to advocate for their rights and interests.
5. Engage in dialogue and action with other allies: Work with others who are committed to creating a more just and equitable society. Engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue, and work together to challenge systems of oppression and promote inclusivity and equity.
