Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, regardless of their age or sexual orientation. For people over 90 years old (or over 85), the impact of genetic conditions can be particularly pronounced due to the increased likelihood of co-occurring health issues and the potential for more severe consequences.

Some common genetic conditions that can affect individuals over 90 years old include:

1. Alzheimer's disease and other dementias: These conditions can significantly impact an individual's cognitive function, memory, and overall quality of life.
2. Parkinson's disease: A neurodegenerative disorder that can cause movement difficulties, balance problems, and mobility issues.
3. Heart disease: Older adults are more likely to experience heart disease due to the natural aging process, and genetic conditions can increase this risk further.
4. Diabetes: Genetic predisposition can contribute to the development of diabetes, particularly in older adults.
5. Osteoporosis: A degenerative bone disorder that can cause fragility and increase the risk of fractures.
6. Cancer: Older adults are more susceptible to various types of cancer due to their age and underlying health conditions.
7. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): A progressive lung disease that can make breathing difficult, especially for those over 85 years old.
8. Stroke: Genetic conditions can increase the risk of stroke, particularly in older adults.
9. Neurodegenerative disorders: These conditions can affect cognitive function and can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life. Examples include Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia.
10. Autoimmune disorders: Genetic conditions can increase the risk of developing autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or multiple sclerosis
