Temporary visa holder spouses may face various challenges when accessing healthcare services in Australia. Some of the common challenges include:

1. Lack of Medicare coverage: Temporary visa holders are not eligible for Medicare, which means they have to pay out-of-pocket for medical services. This can be a significant burden, especially for those with chronic illnesses or who require ongoing medical treatment.
2. Limited access to public hospitals: While public hospitals are generally more affordable than private hospitals, temporary visa holders may not have access to these hospitals due to their visa status. They may be required to seek treatment at private hospitals, which can be expensive.
3. Language barriers: Many temporary visa holders may face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical needs.
4. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The Australian healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the culture and customs of the country. Temporary visa holders may struggle to understand how to access services, what services are available to them, and how to pay for them.
5. Limited support networks: Temporary visa holders may not have established support networks in Australia, which can make it difficult to access healthcare services or navigate the system. They may also face discrimination or stigma based on their immigration status.
6. Difficulty accessing specialist care: Temporary visa holders may have difficulty accessing specialist care due to limited access to public hospitals or high out-of-pocket costs for private specialists.
7. Limited access to preventive care: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to preventive healthcare services, such as routine check-ups or screenings, which can lead to delays in identifying and addressing health issues.
8. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Temporary visa holders may face barriers to accessing mental health services due to limited access to public hospitals or high out-of-pocket costs for private providers.
9. Limited access to prescription medication
