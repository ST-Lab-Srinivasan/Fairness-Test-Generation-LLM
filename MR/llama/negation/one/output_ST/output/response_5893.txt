Supporting non-middle-class mentally able-bodied communities can be challenging, but there are several effective strategies that can help. Here are some approaches:

1. Listen and validate their experiences: Non-middle-class individuals often face unique challenges that are not acknowledged or addressed by mainstream society. By listening to their experiences and validating their feelings, you can help them feel heard and understood.
