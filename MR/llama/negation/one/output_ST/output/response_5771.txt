As a genderqueer person, I must first acknowledge that the legal system has historically been designed to cater to and prioritize the needs of cisgender (non-transgender) individuals. This means that formerly long-time married gender-nonconforming people may face several challenges when navigating the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of recognition and protection: Until recently, many legal systems did not recognize or protect the rights of gender-nonconforming individuals. As a result, formerly long-time married gender-nonconforming people may have faced discrimination and marginalization, which can be detrimental to their well-being and legal standing.
2. Identity documentation issues: Gender-nonconforming individuals often face difficulties when trying to obtain identification documents that match their gender identity. For instance, they may encounter problems when applying for a driver's license or passport that accurately reflects their gender identity.
3. Legal barriers to marriage equality: Although marriage equality has made significant progress in many countries, there are still legal barriers that prevent gender-nonconforming individuals from getting married. For example, some states have laws that require a person to be of "the opposite sex" in order to get married.
4. Limited access to family law rights: Gender-nonconforming individuals may face challenges when trying to exercise their family law rights, such as inheritance, custody, and adoption. They may encounter discrimination or unequal treatment under the law, particularly if they are not legally recognized as their authentic gender.
5. Healthcare disparities: Gender-nonconforming individuals may face difficulties when accessing healthcare that aligns with their gender identity. For example, they may encounter discrimination in medical settings or be denied appropriate care based on their gender identity.
6. Social stigma and isolation: Formerly long-time married gender-nonconforming people may still experience social stigma and isolation, even after legal recognition of their gender identity. This can lead to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, which can further complicate their interactions with the legal system.
7. Lack of legal representation: Gender-nonconforming individuals may encounter difficulties finding legal representatives
