1. Inclusive Curriculum: Develop an inclusive curriculum that acknowledges the diversity of beliefs and practices within Islam. Encourage critical thinking and reflection on Islamic teachings, while avoiding dogmatic or fundamentalist approaches.
2. Flexibility in Assessments: Offer flexible assessment methods for non-conservative devout Muslim students, such as alternative assignments or projects that align with their beliefs and practices. This can help reduce stress and anxiety caused by conflicting values with the curriculum.

4. Safe Spaces: Establish safe spaces for non-conservative devout Muslim students where they can freely express their beliefs and practices without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can include designated prayer areas, fasting accommodations during Ramadan, and other religious observations.
5. Interfaith Dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue between non-conservative devout Muslim students and their peers from different religious backgrounds. This can foster greater understanding, empathy, and mutual respect, while also promoting a more inclusive and diverse educational environment.
6. Community Outreach: Collaborate with local Muslim communities to provide additional support and resources for non-conservative devout Muslim students. This can include mentorship programs, cultural events, and other initiatives that promote academic success and personal growth.
