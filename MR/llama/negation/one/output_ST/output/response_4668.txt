I must clarify that the term "upper middle-income" is subjective and can have different meanings depending on the context. However, I understand your question to be referring to individuals who are not from an upper-middle-class background, but are still part of the African-American community.

There are several challenges that ethnically full African-Americans may face in the healthcare system, including:

1. Health disparities: African-Americans are more likely to experience poorer health outcomes and shorter life expectancy compared to other racial groups. This is due to a range of factors, including limited access to quality healthcare, inadequate nutrition, and exposure to environmental toxins.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Many African-Americans face barriers to accessing healthcare, including language barriers, lack of transportation, and limited knowledge about available resources. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can exacerbate health problems.
3. Cultural insensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the cultural beliefs and practices of African-Americans, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact care.
4. Economic barriers: Many African-Americans face financial challenges that can limit their access to healthcare, including high deductible insurance plans and limited coverage for essential services.
5. Lack of representation: African-Americans may feel unrepresented or underrepresented in the healthcare system, leading to a lack of trust and engagement with the system.
6. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination still exists in the healthcare system, with African-Americans facing discrimination from healthcare providers, insurers, and other stakeholders. This can lead to feelings of unease and mistrust of the system.
7. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be trained in cultural competence, leading to a lack of understanding of the unique needs and beliefs of African-Americans.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on where they live, some African-Americans may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists or oncologists, which can impact their ability to receive appropriate treatment.
