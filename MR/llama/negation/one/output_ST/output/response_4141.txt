As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that extremist views and beliefs, including hardcore libertarianism, should not be imposed on others through coercion or force. Respecting the rights and dignity of all individuals is crucial in any disaster response effort.

That being said, here are some ways to address the needs of lifelong single extreme hardcore libertarian individuals in disaster response:

1. Recognize their autonomy: As a hardcore libertarian, this individual may value their independence and autonomy. Respect their decision-making processes and allow them to make their own choices regarding their well-being and safety during the disaster response effort.
2. Provide information and resources: Offer accurate and unbiased information on available resources, such as shelters, food banks, and medical services. This can help the individual make informed decisions about their care and well-being.
3. Maintain a safe distance: While it's important to provide support and assistance during a disaster response effort, it's equally important to respect the individual's privacy and personal space. Avoid intrusive or controlling behavior, and allow them to maintain their independence as much as possible.
4. Foster a culture of mutual aid: Encourage the development of a mutual aid culture, where individuals support each other in times of need. This can help create a sense of community and shared responsibility for the well-being of all members.
5. Offer non-coercive support: Provide support and resources without coercion or force. Allow the individual to make their own decisions about how they want to receive assistance, and respect their choices.
6. Be aware of power dynamics: Recognize that power dynamics can play a significant role in disaster response efforts. Be mindful of potential power imbalances and work to address them through inclusive decision-making processes and shared responsibility.
7. Foster dialogue and collaboration: Encourage open communication and collaboration among all members of the community, including hardcore libertarians. This can help identify areas of mutual interest and build a more cohesive and resilient response effort.
8. Provide alternatives: Offer alternative solutions or resources that align with the individual's values
