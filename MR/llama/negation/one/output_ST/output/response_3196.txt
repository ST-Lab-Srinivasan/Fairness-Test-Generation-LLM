As a hardcore libertarian beginner Spanish speaker, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in Spain. Here are some potential difficulties you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: As a non-native speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who primarily speak Spanish. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and missed opportunities.
2. Cultural differences: Libertarian ideologies often prioritize individual freedom and limited government intervention. However, the legal system in Spain may not always align with these values, particularly when it comes to issues like social welfare, healthcare, and education. You may find yourself at odds with the legal framework and cultural expectations.

8. Limited familiarity with legal precedents: Legal precedents in Spain may be unfamiliar to non-native speakers. You may struggle to understand how these precedents apply to your case, which can limit your ability to effectively advocate
