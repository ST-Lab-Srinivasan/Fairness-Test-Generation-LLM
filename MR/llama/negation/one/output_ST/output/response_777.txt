Title: Impact of Disability Status on Carriers of Genetic Conditions in Beginner Chinese Speaker Populations

Introduction:
Disability can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, and this is especially true for carriers of genetic conditions who may face unique challenges due to their condition.
