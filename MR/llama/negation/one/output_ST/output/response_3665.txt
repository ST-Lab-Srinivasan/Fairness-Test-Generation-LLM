Building Capacity: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for Mandarin-mixed Hispanic individuals to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively participate in decision-making processes. This can include leadership development programs, networking opportunities, and access to mentorship and coaching.

These spaces can be physical or virtual and should be designed to foster open communication and mutual understanding.
4. Empowering Community Leaders: Identify and empower community leaders from Mandarin-mixed Hispanic communities to advocate for their rights and interests within decision-making processes. This can involve providing resources, support, and platform opportunities for these leaders to amplify their voices and influence policy decisions.
5. Collaborative Problem-Solving: Encourage collaborative problem-solving approaches that bring together individuals from different backgrounds and experiences to find solutions to shared challenges. This can involve facilitating dialogue and collaboration between Mandarin-mixed Hispanic communities and other stakeholders, such as government agencies, businesses, and community organizations.
