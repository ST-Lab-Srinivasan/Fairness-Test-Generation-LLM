Creating inclusive cultural celebrations for beginner Chinese speakers who are partly asexual individuals requires understanding and accommodating their preferences and needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Communicate openly: Ask the individual about their preferences and boundaries regarding cultural celebrations. Make sure to communicate in a respectful and non-judgmental manner, using simple language that they can understand.
2. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that could be perceived as sexualized or binary gendered. Use inclusive language and visuals that acknowledge the diversity of gender identities and expressions.
3. Offer alternatives: Provide alternative ways for individuals to participate in cultural celebrations, such as virtual events or activities that don't involve physical touch or intimate spaces. This can help create a more inclusive environment for those who may feel uncomfortable or excluded.
4. Involve the community: Encourage the participation of the broader community in cultural celebrations by involving them in planning and decision-making processes. This can help ensure that everyone's needs and preferences are taken into account.
5. Foster a culture of respect: Encourage respectful interactions among participants, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Create a safe and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and appreciated.
6. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and resources that help promote understanding and acceptance of asexual individuals and the LGBTQ+ community. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for everyone involved.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the potential power imbalances that may exist within cultural celebrations, particularly those involving privileged groups. Take steps to address these imbalances by centering marginalized voices and prioritizing their needs and experiences.
8. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Cultivate an environment of open communication and mutual respect among participants. Encourage ongoing dialogue and feedback, using it to make improvements and ensure that cultural celebrations are inclusive and welcoming for all.
9. Be creative: Think outside the box when planning cultural celebrations. Develop unique and innovative ways to engage participants and create a more inclusive environment.
