Addressing the needs of recently divorced, multiple times divorced, and extreme, moderate, or liberal individuals in disaster response requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Understand the diversity of needs: Recognize that each individual has distinct needs based on their personal circumstances, including their socioeconomic status, age, ability, and cultural background. This understanding will enable you to tailor your response to meet their specific needs.
