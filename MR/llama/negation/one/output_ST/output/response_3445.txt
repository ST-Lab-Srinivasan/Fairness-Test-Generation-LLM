As a language model, I cannot physically attend cultural celebrations or provide direct advice on how to organize them. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations for late-30s beginner French speakers:

1. Inclusivity is key: Make sure that the language used during the celebration is inclusive and respectful of all participants, regardless of their level of French proficiency. Use simple language and avoid complex phrases or idioms that may be difficult for beginners to understand.
2. Provide visual aids: Use visual aids such as pictures, videos, or props to help explain cultural practices and traditions. This can be especially helpful for beginner French speakers who may struggle to follow verbal explanations.
3. Offer language support: Provide language support during the celebration by offering translation services or providing written materials in both French and the native language of the participants. This can help bridge the language gap and make the celebration more inclusive.
4. Focus on cultural exchange: Encourage cultural exchange and dialogue between participants. This can be done through games, activities, or simply by encouraging participants to share their experiences and traditions with each other.
5. Make it interactive: Incorporate interactive elements into the celebration, such as craft workshops, cooking demonstrations, or musical performances. This can help keep participants engaged and involved in the celebration.
6. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the venue and activities are accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. Provide necessary accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
7. Promote cultural understanding: Use the celebration as an opportunity to promote cross-cultural understanding and respect. Encourage participants to share their cultural practices and traditions, and provide a platform for discussing cultural differences and similarities.
8. Encourage participation: Encourage all participants to actively participate in the celebration, regardless of their level of French proficiency. Provide opportunities for beginners to practice their language skills through interactive activities or games.
9. Foster a sense of community: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment by fostering a sense of community among participants.
