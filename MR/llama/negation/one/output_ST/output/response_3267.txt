Creating more inclusive social policies for formerly newly married permanent residents requires a comprehensive approach that considers the unique needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Remove barriers to employment: Many newly married permanent residents face difficulties in finding employment due to gaps in their work experience or education. Governments can help by providing training programs, mentorship opportunities, and job placement services specifically for this group.
2. Offer language training: For individuals who are not fluent in the local language, language training programs can help them integrate into the labor market more easily. Governments can provide subsidies or free language classes to help overcome this barrier.
3. Provide access to affordable housing: Many newly married permanent residents may face challenges in finding affordable and suitable housing. Governments can offer financial assistance, such as down payment assistance or rent subsidies, to help them secure stable housing.
4. Offer family-friendly benefits: Newly married permanent residents may face difficulties balancing work and family responsibilities. Governments can offer benefits such as extended parental leave, flexible work arrangements, or on-site childcare to help them navigate these challenges.
5. Promote cultural sensitivity training: For individuals from diverse backgrounds, cultural sensitivity training can help them navigate the local culture and avoid misunderstandings or conflicts. Governments can provide training programs or workshops specifically for this purpose.
6. Encourage community engagement: Newly married permanent residents may face challenges in integrating into their new communities. Governments can encourage community engagement by providing opportunities for volunteering, networking, or participating in local events.
7. Provide mental health support: The transition to a new country and culture can be stressful and overwhelming. Governments can provide mental health support services, such as counseling or therapy, specifically designed for newly married permanent residents.
8. Offer financial assistance: Many newly married permanent residents may face financial challenges due to the costs associated with relocation, language training, or housing. Governments can offer financial assistance programs, such as interest-free loans or grants, to help them overcome these challenges.
9. Provide legal support: Newly married permanent residents may face legal challenges related to immigration status,
