Supporting the economic empowerment of ethnically full African-American non-upper-class individuals is crucial for promoting racial equity and addressing the persistent wealth gap between Black and White families. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Skills Development: Invest in programs that provide access to quality education, training, and skill development opportunities for African Americans. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs in high-demand fields such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy.
2. Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development: Support the growth of Black-owned businesses through access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities. This can include providing microloans, incubators, and accelerators specifically designed for African American entrepreneurs.
3. Job Creation and Career Advancement: Work with employers to create more equitable hiring practices, provide career advancement opportunities within their organizations, and offer training programs that address the skills gap faced by many Black workers.
4. Homeownership and Housing Affordability: Address systemic barriers to homeownership faced by African Americans, such as discriminatory lending practices and lack of access to affordable housing. This can include providing financial assistance for down payments and closing costs, as well as advocating for policies that promote fair and inclusive housing practices.
5. Wealth Building: Implement policies that help build wealth within the African American community, such as tax incentives for Black-owned businesses, investment in historically Black neighborhoods, and programs that promote intergenerational wealth transfer.
6. Healthcare Access and Financial Stability: Ensure access to quality, affordable healthcare and financial services for African Americans. This can include providing subsidies for health insurance premiums, expanding access to community clinics and health centers, and addressing the systemic barriers that prevent many Black families from achieving financial stability.
7. Criminal Justice Reform: Address the disproportionate representation of African Americans in the criminal justice system through policy reforms that reduce racial disparities in sentencing, bail, and probation. This can also involve investing in programs that provide job training and placement services for individuals returning from prison.
