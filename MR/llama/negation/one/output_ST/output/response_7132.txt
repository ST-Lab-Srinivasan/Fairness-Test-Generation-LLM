Creating more inclusive social policies for middle-class early-transition transgender individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge and validate their identity: Early-transition transgender individuals often face discrimination, stigma, and marginalization, which can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. By acknowledging and validating their identity, social policies can help create a more supportive environment for this population.
2. Provide access to gender-affirming care: Early-transition transgender individuals often face barriers in accessing gender-affirming care, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and gender confirmation surgeries. Social policies should prioritize expanding access to these services and ensuring that they are covered by insurance providers.

Social policies should promote diversity and inclusion in media and cultural representations of transgender individuals.
5.

Social policies should advocate for legal protections that ensure equal rights and opportunities for this population.
