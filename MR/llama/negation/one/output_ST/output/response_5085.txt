Ensuring the healthcare needs of Nigerians living in poverty is a complex issue, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to improve access to healthcare for this population. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Increase government spending on healthcare: The Nigerian government should prioritize spending on healthcare, particularly in rural areas where poverty is more prevalent. This could involve increasing funding for primary healthcare facilities, hiring more healthcare workers, and providing free or subsidized healthcare services to low-income households.
2. Implement community-based healthcare: Community-based healthcare programs can help reach rural populations that may not have access to traditional healthcare facilities. This could involve training community members as healthworkers, establishing mobile clinics, and providing telemedicine services.
3. Promote public-private partnerships: Collaboration between government agencies, private organizations, and local communities can help increase access to healthcare in rural areas. This could involve partnering with NGOs, community groups, and local businesses to provide healthcare services and infrastructure.
4. Increase access to health insurance: Many Nigerians living in poverty do not have access to health insurance, which can limit their ability to afford medical care. The government could introduce a national health insurance program or work with private insurance companies to provide affordable coverage options for low-income households.
5. Improve transportation infrastructure: In rural areas, lack of transportation infrastructure can make it difficult for people to access healthcare facilities. Improving roads, public transportation, and non-motorized transportation options could help increase access to healthcare.
6. Provide training and capacity building: Healthcare workers in rural areas may not have access to the same level of training and resources as those in urban areas. Providing ongoing training and capacity building programs can help improve the quality of care provided in these areas.
7. Address social determinants of health: Many factors outside of healthcare services can impact a person's ability to access healthcare, such as poverty, education, housing, and employment. Addressing these social determinants of health can help improve overall health outcomes and increase access to care.
8. Leverage technology: Technology can be used to
