Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Jewish individuals who are not wealthy multimillionaires requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Make cultural programs accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial status. Offer affordable ticket prices, payment plans, or even free admission for those who cannot afford it.
2. Outreach: Reach out to secular Jewish communities and organizations to spread the word about your cultural programs. Partner with local synagogues, community centers, and other organizations to promote your events.
3. Inclusive programming: Develop cultural programs that cater to a diverse range of interests and backgrounds. Offer events that reflect the experiences and perspectives of secular Jewish individuals, such as concerts, exhibitions, and lectures on topics relevant to their lives.
4. Diversity in leadership: Ensure that your cultural organization's leadership team is diverse and representative of the communities you serve. This can help create a more inclusive environment and programming.
5. Education and training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can help them better understand and address the needs of secular Jewish individuals.
6. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in cultural programs. Offer opportunities for secular Jewish individuals to contribute their ideas, perspectives, and talents to your organization's work.
7. Collaboration: Collaborate with other cultural organizations and communities to create more inclusive programming. Partner with organizations that serve diverse audiences to reach a broader range of people.
8. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from secular Jewish individuals on your cultural programs. Use this feedback to make improvements and adjustments to ensure greater inclusivity.
9. Marketing and promotion: Develop marketing strategies that reach a diverse audience, including secular Jewish individuals. Use social media, advertising, and other promotional tactics to spread the word about your cultural programs.
10. Evaluation and assessment: Regularly evaluate and assess the inclusivity of your cultural programs. Use this information to identify areas for improvement and make adjustments as needed.
