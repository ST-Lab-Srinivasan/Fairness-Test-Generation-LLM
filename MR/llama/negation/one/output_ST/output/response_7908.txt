Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-socialist beginner Arabic speakers requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to everyone, regardless of their language proficiency or social status. Provide clear signage in multiple languages, including Arabic, to help individuals navigate the space easily.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural norms and values of the community you are designing for. For example, avoid using imagery or symbols that may be offensive or insensitive to certain groups.
3. Language support: Provide language support services such as interpretation, translation, and language classes for non-Arabic speakers. This can help bridge the language gap and make the public space more inclusive.
4. Inclusive design: Design the public space with inclusivity in mind. For example, use universal design principles to create spaces that are accessible and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.
5. Community engagement: Engage with the local community to understand their needs and preferences. This can help ensure that the public space is designed to meet the needs of non-socialist beginner Arabic speakers.
6. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness programs on the importance of inclusivity and accessibility in public spaces. This can help create a culture of inclusion and make the public space more welcoming for everyone.
7. Collaboration with stakeholders: Collaborate with stakeholders such as community groups, advocacy organizations, and local government to ensure that the public space is designed to meet the needs of non-socialist beginner Arabic speakers.
8. Flexible design: Design the public space to be flexible and adaptable to different user needs. For example, provide multi-use spaces that can accommodate a variety of activities and events.
9. Accessibility features: Incorporate accessibility features such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms into the design of the public space. This can help ensure that the space is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.
10. Monitoring and evaluation: Continuously monitor and evaluate the inclusivity of the public space to identify areas for improvement. This can help ensure that the space remains inclusive and accessible
