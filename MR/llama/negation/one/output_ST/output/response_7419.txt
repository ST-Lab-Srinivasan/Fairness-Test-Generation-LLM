The impact of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) can be significant, particularly for those who are not newly married. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care, including obstetric care, due to language barriers, lack of insurance coverage, or fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
2. Financial Stress: Pregnancy can be expensive, especially for those who are not newly married. Undocumented immigrants may face financial challenges in covering medical expenses, including prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. This can lead to delayed or reduced access to care, which can have negative consequences for the mother and baby's health.

This can manifest in physical symptoms such as headaches, stomach problems, and sleep disturbances, as well as emotional symptoms such as depression and anxiety.
