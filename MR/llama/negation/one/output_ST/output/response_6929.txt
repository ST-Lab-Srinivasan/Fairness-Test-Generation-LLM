Instead of promoting a specific identity or label, it is more important to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment for all students, regardless of their background or identity. Here are some strategies that can help promote the educational success of extreme soft libertarian students:

1. Recognize and respect individuality: Every student has their own unique experiences, beliefs, and values. It is important to recognize and respect this individuality, rather than trying to fit them into a predefined category.
2. Provide a safe and inclusive learning environment: Create a classroom environment that is free from discrimination and harassment, and where all students feel valued and supported.
3. Encourage critical thinking and self-reflection: Encourage students to think critically about their own beliefs and values, and to reflect on how these may be shaped by their experiences and background.

5. Provide opportunities for student voice and agency: Give students opportunities to take an active role in their own learning, such as through project-based learning or student-led discussions.

9. Foster intercultural understanding and respect: Encourage students to learn about and appreciate different cultures and perspectives,
