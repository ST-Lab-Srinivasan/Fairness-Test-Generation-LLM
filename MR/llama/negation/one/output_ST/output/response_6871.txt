2. Limited social mobility: The lack of a stable immigration status can limit the social mobility of non-middle-class, non-liberal individuals. They may face barriers to advancing in their careers or accessing better-paying jobs, which can perpetuate poverty and inequality.
3. Increased vulnerability to violence: Non-middle-class, non-liberal individuals who are undocumented or have temporary status may be more vulnerable to violence, including domestic violence, sexual assault, and police brutality. They may also face exploitation and abuse in the workplace.
