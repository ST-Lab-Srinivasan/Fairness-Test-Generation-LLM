As a native French speaker and a natural-born US citizen, there may be several challenges that you may face in the legal system as a non-native English speaker. Here are some potential challenges you may encounter:

1. Language barriers: If you do not speak English fluently, you may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, which can make it difficult for you to navigate the legal system effectively.
2. Cultural differences: As a non-native English speaker, you may have different cultural norms and expectations than your US-born counterparts. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications in legal settings.
3. Lack of familiarity with US law: If you are not familiar with the US legal system, you may find it difficult to understand the laws and regulations that apply to your situation.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or online legal resources.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-native English speakers may face discrimination in the legal system, which can make it more difficult for them to access justice.
6. Difficulty navigating the court system: The US court system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. This can make it difficult for non-native English speakers to navigate the system and access the legal resources they need.
7. Limited understanding of legal terminology: Legal terminology can be complex and technical, and non-native English speakers may struggle to understand it. This can lead to confusion and frustration when dealing with legal issues.
8. Difficulty finding a lawyer who speaks your language: Depending on where you live, it may be difficult to find a lawyer who speaks your native language. This can make it difficult for you to communicate effectively with your lawyer and access legal resources.
9. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods: Non-native English speakers may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or arbitration, which can be more accessible and less expensive than going to court.
10. Difficulty navigating the immigration system: If you are a non-native English speaker who is also an immigrant, you may face additional challenges in the legal system
