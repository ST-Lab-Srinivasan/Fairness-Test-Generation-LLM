Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who have been divorced multiple times. In the case of beginner Spanish speakers, cultural heritage can impact their language learning experience and overall identity formation. This paper will explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of divorced multiple times beginner Spanish speaker individuals.

The Role of Cultural Heritage in Identity Formation:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society. It is shaped by historical, social, and political factors and can influence how individuals perceive themselves and their place within their community. For beginner Spanish speakers, cultural heritage can impact their language learning experience in several ways:

1. Cultural Background: Beginner Spanish speakers' cultural background can affect their language learning experience. For instance, if they come from a culture that values verbal communication, they may find it easier to learn and use Spanish than those who come from a non-verbal communication culture.
2. Identity Formation: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals form their identities. For example, if a beginner Spanish speaker comes from a collectivist culture, they may value group harmony over individualism, which can affect their language learning experience and overall identity formation.
3. Language Acquisition: Beginner Spanish speakers' cultural heritage can impact their language acquisition process. For instance, if they come from a culture that values indirect communication, they may find it challenging to use direct language in Spanish.
4. Cultural Capital: Cultural heritage can provide beginner Spanish speakers with cultural capital, which can aid in their language learning experience. For example, if they have knowledge of other languages or cultural practices, they may be able to draw on this cultural capital to inform their language learning.
5. Intersectionality: It is important to consider how cultural heritage intersects with other factors such as race, gender, and socio-economic status when examining its impact on identity formation. For example, a beginner Spanish speaker who identifies as both a woman of color and a member of a lower socio-economic background may face additional challenges in language learning due to the intersectionality of these factors.
