Addressing the Needs of Non-Upper-Class Native Arabic Speaker Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disaster responses often prioritize the needs of upper-class individuals, leaving behind those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. However, it is crucial to recognize that disasters affect everyone equally, regardless of their social status. This article aims to provide insights into how we can address the needs of non-upper-class native Arabic speaker individuals in disaster response.

1. Language Barriers:

To overcome this challenge, disaster response organizations should provide translators and interpreters to facilitate communication between responders and affected communities.
