Creating more inclusive recreational activities for active-duty culturally Hindu people requires understanding and respecting their cultural beliefs and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate Hindu traditions and rituals: Incorporate traditional Hindu rituals and traditions into recreational activities, such as puja (worship) or darshan (viewing of deities). This can help active-duty culturally Hindu people feel more connected to their faith while also participating in recreational activities.
2. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for recreational activity leaders and participants to learn about the beliefs and practices of Hindus, and how to be respectful of them. This can help reduce unintentional offense or discomfort that may arise from not understanding cultural differences.
3. Create diverse recreational activities: Offer a variety of recreational activities that cater to different interests and preferences of active-duty culturally Hindu people. For example, provide yoga classes, meditation sessions, or traditional Indian dance classes. This can help them feel more engaged and included in the recreational activities offered by the military.

Make sure that food provided during recreational activities is inclusive of these dietary restrictions. Offer vegetarian or vegan options, and make sure that they are clearly labeled.

6. Celebrate Hindu holidays and festivals: Celebrate important Hindu holidays and festivals, such as Diwali or Holi, within the military community. This can help active-duty culturally Hindu people feel more connected to their faith and culture while also promoting diversity and inclusivity within the military.
7. Provide access to religious literature: Provide access to religious literature, such as Hindu scriptures or devotional materials,
