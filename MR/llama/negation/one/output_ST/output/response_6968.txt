As a native Chinese speaker and a recent widow, there are several challenges that you may face in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties that you might encounter:

1. Lack of experience and skills: As a widow, you may have taken time off from work to care for your loved one, which can result in a lack of recent work experience and skills. This can make it difficult to compete with other job applicants who have been actively working in the industry.
2. Limited network: Your professional network may be limited due to taking time off or relocating to a new area after your spouse's passing. This can make it challenging to find job opportunities and build connections within the industry.

5. Emotional challenges: Losing a spouse can be emotionally challenging, which can affect your mental health and ability to perform in the workplace. You may need time off for grief counseling or other emotional support, which can impact your job stability.

8. Stereotyping: Unfortunately, there are still many stereotypes and biases against Chinese people in the workplace, which can limit your job
