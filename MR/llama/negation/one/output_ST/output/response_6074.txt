Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Spanish speakers who are recent immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the Community: Engage with local organizations that serve the Latinx community, such as community centers, churches, and schools. These organizations can provide valuable insights into the needs and preferences of their members.
2. Conduct Needs Assessments: Conduct surveys or focus groups to understand the cultural programming needs of recent immigrant Native Spanish speakers. This will help identify what types of programs are missing or under-resourced in the community.
3. Offer Bilingual Programs: Provide cultural programs that are offered in both English and Spanish to cater to the language needs of recent immigrants. This can include cultural workshops, lectures, and exhibitions.
4. Foster Intercultural Exchange: Organize events that bring together Native Spanish speakers and other cultures to promote intercultural understanding and exchange. This can include cultural festivals, language exchange programs, and cross-cultural dialogue sessions.
5. Provide Accessibility Supports: Ensure that all cultural programs are accessible to recent immigrants with disabilities by providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions.
6. Build Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and institutions that serve the Latinx community to co-create and deliver cultural programs. This can help build trust and credibility within the community.
7. Offer Language Training: Provide language training opportunities for recent immigrants to improve their English proficiency and enhance their understanding of American culture.
8. Celebrate Diversity: Highlight the diversity of Native Spanish cultures through cultural programs that showcase traditional music, dance, art, and food. This can help promote cross-cultural appreciation and understanding.
9. Provide Respite Services: Offer respite services for recent immigrants who may be experiencing stress or trauma related to their immigration experience. This can include cultural healing circles, mental health support groups, and community arts programs.
10. Foster Community Engagement: Encourage recent immigrants to participate in community events and initiatives
