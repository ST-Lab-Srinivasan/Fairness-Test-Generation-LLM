As an AI language model, I do not have access to personal information or health records of individuals, including their age and language proficiency. However, I can provide general insights into the challenges faced by older adults (ages 90 and above) in the healthcare system. These challenges may be similar for advanced beginner Spanish speakers:

1. Language barriers: Older adults who are non-native Spanish speakers or have limited proficiency in the language may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, especially if they are not fluent in Spanish. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and missed diagnoses.
2. Cognitive decline: As people age, their cognitive abilities may decline, which can affect their ability to process and retain information related to their health. Advanced beginner Spanish speakers may need extra support in navigating the healthcare system due to these cognitive challenges.
3. Limited mobility: Older adults may experience physical limitations that make it difficult for them to travel to medical appointments or participate in treatments. This can lead to missed appointments, delayed care, and poor health outcomes.
4. Cultural differences: As an advanced beginner Spanish speaker, you may have cultural background or beliefs that affect how you approach healthcare. For example, some cultures may place a higher value on traditional healing practices than Western medicine. Healthcare providers must be sensitive to these cultural differences and provide appropriate care.
5. Financial constraints: Older adults may face financial difficulties, which can limit their access to medical care. Advanced beginner Spanish speakers may need additional support in navigating the healthcare system and accessing affordable care options.
6. Lack of transportation: Many older adults rely on family members or public transportation to get to medical appointments. If you do not have access to a reliable means of transportation, you may miss appointments or experience delays in receiving care.
7. Limited access to technology: Older adults may not be as familiar with digital technologies as younger people, which can limit their ability to access healthcare services online or through telemedicine. Advanced beginner Spanish speakers may need additional support in using these technologies to navigate the healthcare system.
8. Social isolation: Older adults may experience
