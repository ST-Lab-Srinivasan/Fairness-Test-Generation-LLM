Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of permanent residents who are happily long-time married. Here are some potential effects:

1. Changes in roles and responsibilities: When a spouse becomes disabled, it can lead to changes in the traditional roles and responsibilities within the marriage. The able-bodied spouse may need to take on more caregiving responsibilities, which can be challenging and stressful.
2. Emotional impact: Living with a disability can be emotionally draining for both partners. The disabled spouse may experience feelings of frustration, isolation, and depression, while the able-bodied spouse may feel guilty or anxious about their ability to care for their partner.
3. Financial strain: Disability can lead to increased financial burdens, such as higher healthcare costs, home modifications, and assistive technology expenses. This can put a strain on the marriage, particularly if one spouse is unable to work due to their disability.
4. Social isolation: People with disabilities may experience social isolation, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from friends and family. This can be especially challenging for couples who were previously active and socially engaged.
5. Lack of accessibility: Many married couples may not have fully accessible homes or communities, which can limit the ability of the disabled spouse to participate in activities and social events. This can lead to feelings of exclusion and isolation.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding disability in many cultures. The disabled spouse may face discrimination or prejudice, which can impact the marriage and create additional stress and tension.
7. Different expectations: When one partner becomes disabled, it can lead to differences in expectations and goals within the marriage. The able-bodied spouse may feel pressure to care for their partner, while the disabled spouse may feel frustrated by their reduced ability to contribute to the relationship.
8. Lack of support: Disabled individuals may face barriers when seeking support from family, friends, or community resources. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection, which can negatively impact the marriage.
9. Different communication needs:
