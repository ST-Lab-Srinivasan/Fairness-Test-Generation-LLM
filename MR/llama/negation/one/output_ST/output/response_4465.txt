Promoting the educational success of recent immigrants to Canada, particularly those who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy, can be a challenging task. However, there are several strategies that can help:

1. Language Support: Provide language support programs for immigrant students, such as English or French language classes, to help them improve their language skills and better understand the curriculum.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training for teachers and staff to help them understand the diverse cultural backgrounds of immigrant students and how to support them.
3. Academic Support: Provide academic support programs, such as tutoring or mentoring, to help immigrant students who may be struggling academically due to language barriers or cultural differences.
4. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and involvement in school activities to help immigrant students feel more connected and supported.
5. Parent Involvement: Encourage parental involvement in their child's education by providing opportunities for parents to learn about the educational system in Canada, as well as how they can support their child's academic success.
6. Flexible Learning Pathways: Offer flexible learning pathways that cater to the diverse needs and learning styles of immigrant students, including those who may have missed schooling due to displacement or disruption in their home country.
7. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair recent immigrants with experienced teachers or peers who can provide guidance and support in navigating the educational system in Canada.
8. Access to Resources: Ensure that immigrant students have access to resources such as textbooks, technology, and other learning materials that may be unavailable to them in their home country.
9. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that support immigrant communities to provide additional resources and support for immigrant students.
10. Professional Development: Provide professional development opportunities for teachers and staff to learn about the educational needs of immigrant students and how to best support them.

By implementing these strategies, schools can help promote the educational success of recent immigrants to Canada, particularly those who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy.
