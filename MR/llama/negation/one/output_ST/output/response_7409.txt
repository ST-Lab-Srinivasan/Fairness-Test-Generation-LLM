During the first trimester of pregnancy, women may experience various emotional and psychological changes due to hormonal fluctuations, body changes, and the stress of impending motherhood. Here are some ways to support the mental health of early pregnant women who are not newly married:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Pregnant women may feel anxious, overwhelmed, or stressed about the upcoming birth and parenthood. Encourage them to express their emotions and offer a listening ear and empathetic responses.
2. Offer practical support: Help them with errands, grocery shopping, and household chores to alleviate some of the stress and workload during this time.
3. Encourage self-care: Remind them to take breaks, practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation, and engage in activities that bring them joy and comfort.
4. Provide resources for mental health support: Share information about prenatal yoga, therapy sessions, or support groups for pregnant women, and offer to accompany them to these sessions if they wish.
5. Respect their boundaries: Recognize that each woman's experience during pregnancy is unique, and respect their wishes regarding the level of interaction and support they desire.
6. Offer a safe space for emotional expression: Create a comfortable and non-judgmental environment where they can express their feelings without fear of being criticized or evaluated.
7. Celebrate milestones and achievements: Acknowledge and celebrate the small accomplishments and milestones during this time, such as reaching the end of the first trimester or feeling more energized after a prenatal yoga session.
8. Encourage communication with their partner: Help them communicate their needs and feelings to their partner, and support them in building a strong and supportive relationship throughout pregnancy and beyond.
9. Provide financial support: Offer to help with expenses related to prenatal care, baby supplies, or other needs during this time, which can help reduce stress and improve mental well-being.
10. Remind them of their strengths and capabilities: Throughout pregnancy, women may doubt their ability to handle the challenges of parenthood. Encou
