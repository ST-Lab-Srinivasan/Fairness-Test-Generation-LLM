Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native Arabic speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people with disabilities, including those who may be non-verbal or have difficulty communicating in Arabic. Provide Braille signage, audio announcements, and other accommodations as needed.
2. Language support: Offer interpretation services, such as live translation or subtitles, for public events, meetings, and announcements. This can help bridge the language barrier and make the space more inclusive for Arabic speakers who may not be fluent in other languages.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and customs when designing and maintaining the public space. For example, provide separate areas for men and women to ensure privacy and respect for gender segregation customs.
4. Education and awareness: Organize workshops or training sessions to educate staff and the community on how to interact with and support individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, or those who may have difficulty communicating in Arabic.
5. Technology integration: Utilize technology such as text-to-speech software, mobile apps, or digital displays to provide real-time translation or communication support for Arabic speakers. This can help bridge the language gap and create a more inclusive environment.
6. Community outreach: Engage with local Arabic-speaking communities through outreach programs, surveys, or focus groups to better understand their needs and preferences when it comes to public spaces. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that the space is designed to meet the unique needs of this community.
7. Partnership with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that support Arabic-speaking communities, such as language schools or cultural centers, to leverage their expertise and resources when designing and maintaining the public space.
8. Accessible amenities: Provide amenities such as seating areas, restrooms, and water fountains that are accessible and comfortable for individuals with mobility impairments or other disabilities.
9. Wayfinding: Ensure that the public space is well-signed and easy to navigate, with clear directions and maps that
