Ensuring that the voices of individuals with genetic conditions in the third trimester of pregnancy are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for delivering high-quality, person-centered care. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Involve them in care planning: Engage individuals with genetic conditions in the care planning process by inviting them to participate in multidisciplinary team meetings. This will help ensure their voices are heard and their preferences respected.
