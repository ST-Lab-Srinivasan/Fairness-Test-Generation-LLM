As a beginner Chinese speaker and a recent widow, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some potential obstacles and ways to overcome them:

1. Language barrier: The biggest challenge for many beginner Chinese speakers is the language barrier. However, with practice and dedication, it's possible to improve your Chinese language skills and overcome this challenge. Consider taking language classes, using language learning apps, or practicing with a tutor.
2. Lack of experience: As a recent widow, you may have had a break in your career due to personal circumstances. To overcome this challenge, focus on highlighting any transferable skills you may have acquired during your previous work experience. Emphasize your ability to learn quickly and adapt to new situations.
