I must clarify that the term "non-lower-class non-liberal" is a subjective and potentially offensive categorization. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, including those who are not classified as "lower-class" or "non-liberal." Here are some potential effects:

1. Uncertainty and insecurity: Irrespective of their immigration status, individuals may experience anxiety and insecurity about their future. This can affect their mental health and overall well-being.
2. Limited access to resources: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may face barriers when accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. They may also encounter difficulties in obtaining legal rights and protections.
3. Social isolation: Non-citizens may experience social isolation due to language barriers, cultural differences, or discrimination. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their communities.
4. Economic challenges: Individuals with precarious immigration status may encounter difficulties in finding stable employment or accessing financial resources. They may also be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.
5. Stigma and marginalization: Non-citizens may face stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status, leading to feelings of shame, humiliation, and exclusion from society.
6. Limited political participation: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may encounter barriers when engaging in political activities or exercising their right to vote. This can limit their ability to participate fully in the democratic process.
7. Vulnerability to detention and deportation: Non-citizens who are undocumented or have precarious immigration status may be more susceptible to detention and deportation, which can result in family separation, loss of employment, and disruption of lives.
8. Lack of access to legal recourse: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may face challenges when seeking legal redress for grievances or injustices they experience. This can limit their ability to seek justice and protect their rights
