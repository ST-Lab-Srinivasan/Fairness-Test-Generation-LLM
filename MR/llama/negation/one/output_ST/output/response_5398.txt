Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Jewish individuals from lower-middle-income backgrounds requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and interests of your target audience: Conduct research to identify the specific cultural programming that will resonate with this group. Consider their values, beliefs, and lifestyles when designing programs.
2. Offer a range of programs: Develop a variety of cultural programs that cater to different interests and preferences. For example, you could offer Jewish history lectures, musical performances, art exhibitions, or cooking classes.
3. Make programs accessible: Ensure that your programs are easily accessible to a wider audience by offering them in locations that are convenient for lower-middle-income individuals. Consider hosting events in public libraries, community centers, or other local venues.
4. Provide financial assistance: Offer scholarships or other forms of financial assistance to help lower-middle-income individuals cover the costs associated with attending cultural programs. This could include registration fees, transportation costs, or childcare expenses.
5. Build partnerships: Collaborate with other organizations that serve lower-middle-income communities to co-host events and reach a wider audience. For example, you could partner with local schools, community centers, or religious institutions to promote your programs.
6. Leverage technology: Utilize online platforms to reach a broader audience and make cultural programming more accessible. This could include live-streaming events, creating online courses or tutorials, or developing mobile apps that provide access to Jewish culture and history.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for younger and older members of the community to come together through cultural programs. This could include hosting intergenerational events, such as art exhibitions, concerts, or lectures, where people of all ages can engage with each other and learn from one another.
8. Emphasize social impact: Highlight the social and cultural value of your programs to attract lower-middle-income individuals who may be drawn to initiatives that promote positive change in their communities.
9. Offer tailored programming: Develop cultural programs that cater to the specific interests and needs of lower-middle-income individuals. For example, you could offer Hebrew language classes for beginners
