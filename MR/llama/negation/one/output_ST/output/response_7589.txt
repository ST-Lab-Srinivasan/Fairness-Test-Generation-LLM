Ensuring that the housing needs of documented very old (90s+) individuals are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including physical and functional abilities, financial resources, social support networks, and access to healthcare. Here are some strategies to help meet the housing needs of this population:

1. Age-friendly housing designs: Developers can create age-friendly housing designs that cater to the specific needs of older adults, such as wider doorways, hallways, and rooms; non-slip flooring; grab bars in bathrooms; and lowered countertops and shelving.
2. Adaptive reuse of existing buildings: Existing buildings can be adapted for use by older adults, such as converting office spaces into residential units or retrofitting apartments with age-friendly features.
3. Inclusive zoning policies: Zoning policies can be designed to encourage the development of age-inclusive housing options, such as mixed-use developments that combine residential and commercial spaces.
4. Financing options: Financing options, such as government-backed loans or grants, can help older adults access home modifications or new housing that meets their needs.
5. Home sharing programs: Home sharing programs match older adults with non-elderly homeowners who are willing to provide temporary housing in exchange for rent or other forms of compensation.
6. Co-housing communities: Co-housing communities are intentional neighborhoods designed to support older adults in living independently and connecting with peers. These communities often have shared common spaces, such as kitchens, dining areas, and outdoor spaces.
7. Accessible transportation options: Ensuring that older adults have access to reliable and affordable transportation options can help them maintain their independence and access community resources.
8. Healthcare integration: Integrating healthcare services into housing developments can provide older adults with easy access to medical care, social support, and other essential services.
9. Community outreach and education: Educating the broader community about the housing needs of older adults and the benefits of age-friendly housing designs can help build support for inclusive zoning policies and other initiatives that promote aging in place.
