I must clarify that the term "mildly heterosexual" is not a recognized or valid label in the LGBTQ+ community, as sexuality is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity. It is important to respect people's self-identification and avoid using terms that may be perceived as invalidating or offensive.

Regarding the challenges faced by people in the job market based on their sexual orientation, it is important to recognize that discrimination and unequal treatment continue to persist against LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who identify as heterosexual. Here are some of the challenges that may be faced by permanent residents exclusively mildly heterosexual people in the job market:

1. Lack of representation and role models: Visible representation and role models in leadership positions can help to create a more inclusive and supportive work environment for LGBTQ+ individuals. The absence of such representation can make it harder for them to feel seen and valued in their workplace.
2. Microaggressions and bias: LGBTQ+ individuals may face microaggressions, biases, or unequal treatment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can include assumptions about their identity, expectations of how they should conform to societal norms, or discrimination in hiring, promotion, or job assignments.
3. Difficulty disclosing identity: Many LGBTQ+ individuals may face challenges disclosing their sexual orientation or gender identity in the workplace due to fear of discrimination or marginalization. This can lead to a lack of support and resources for these individuals, which can negatively impact their well-being and job performance.
4. Limited career advancement opportunities: LGBTQ+ individuals may face barriers to career advancement, including limited access to mentorship, training, or leadership opportunities. This can result in a lack of representation in senior roles and lower levels of pay and recognition.
5. Stereotyping and stigma: LGBTQ+ individuals may be subject to stereotypes and stigma based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can lead to negative attitudes and behaviors from coworkers, managers, and clients, creating a hostile work environment.
