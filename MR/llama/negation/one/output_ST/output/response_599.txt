Promoting the social inclusion of Native American natural-born US citizen middle-class communities is essential for addressing the historical and systemic inequalities that have affected these communities. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to promote social inclusion:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the history, culture, and experiences of Native American communities. Share this knowledge with others to raise awareness and promote understanding.
2. Support Native-owned businesses: Shopping at Native-owned businesses helps to support the economy of these communities and promote their economic development.
3. Advocate for policy changes: Advocate for policies that address the systemic inequalities faced by Native American communities, such as unequal access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.
4. Engage in community-building activities: Participate in cultural events, festivals, and other community-building activities that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
5. Support youth development programs: Invest in programs that support the educational and personal growth of Native American youth, such as mentorship programs, scholarships, and after-school activities.
6. Promote language revitalization: Many Native American languages are endangered, and promoting language revitalization can help to preserve cultural heritage and promote intergenerational understanding.
7. Address environmental justice issues: Many Native American communities face environmental justice issues, such as pollution and contamination of water sources. Advocate for policies that address these issues and promote sustainable development.
8. Support mental health services: Many Native American communities face high rates of mental health issues, such as substance abuse and suicide. Support mental health services that are culturally sensitive and accessible to these communities.
9. Engage in intergenerational dialogue: Facilitate dialogue between older and younger generations of Native Americans to promote cultural understanding and exchange.
10. Celebrate Native American heritage: Celebrate Native American cultural heritage through events, exhibitions, and other initiatives that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.

By implementing these strategies, we can promote the social inclusion of Native American middle-class communities and work towards addressing the systemic inequalities that have affected these communities for centuries.
