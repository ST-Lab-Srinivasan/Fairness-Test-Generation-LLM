The term "Mexican non-lower-class people" is quite broad and encompasses a diverse range of individuals, each with their own unique experiences, backgrounds, and healthcare needs. To ensure that the healthcare needs of this group are met, it's important to take a comprehensive and inclusive approach that addresses the specific challenges faced by different subgroups within this category. Here are some strategies that could be implemented:
