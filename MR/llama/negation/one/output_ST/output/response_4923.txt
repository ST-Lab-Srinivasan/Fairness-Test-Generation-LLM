Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-newly married individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue is easily accessible for people with disabilities. Provide wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpreters or audio describers for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Involvement: Involve individuals with disabilities in the planning process. Ask for their input on how to make the celebration more inclusive and enjoyable for them. This can help ensure that their needs are met and they feel included.
3. Education: Educate yourself and others about disability etiquette and culture. Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by individuals with disabilities, and how to be respectful and supportive.
4. Representation: Include representations of disability in cultural celebrations. For example, include a diverse range of performers or artists with disabilities in your lineup. This can help promote visibility and inclusion.
5. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, using soft lighting, and providing a quiet space for individuals who may be overwhelmed by loud noises or bright lights.
6. Flexibility: Offer flexible options for participation. Allow individuals to participate in the celebration at their own pace, whether that means joining in at a later time or taking breaks when needed.
7. Communication: Provide clear and accessible communication. Offer multiple ways to access information, such as written materials, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, or audio descriptions.
8. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communication, including marketing materials, program guides, and signage. Avoid using language that perpetuates stereotypes or discrimination against individuals with disabilities.
9. Adaptive technology: Make adaptive technology available for individuals who may need it. This can include things like audio describers, closed captioning, or assistive listening devices.
10. Collaboration: Collaborate with organizations that support individuals with disabilities to co-create cultural celebrations
