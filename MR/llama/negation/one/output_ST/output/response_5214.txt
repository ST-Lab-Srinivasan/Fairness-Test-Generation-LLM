The benefits of having diverse perspectives from non-traditional or non-long-time married individuals, such as non-citizens, can bring a fresh and unique viewpoint to the table. Here are some potential advantages:

1. Unique life experiences: Non-citizens may have had different life experiences than traditional married couples, such as growing up in a different culture or country, facing discrimination, or experiencing social and economic inequality. These experiences can provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by marginalized communities.
2. Cross-cultural understanding: Non-citizens may have a deeper understanding of cultural differences and how they impact relationships. This can help to break down cultural barriers and promote empathy and understanding within the couple.
3. Fresh perspectives on communication: Non-citizens may have developed unique communication styles that can help to improve communication within the couple. For example, they may be more direct or indirect in their communication style, which can help to challenge each other's assumptions and improve communication.
4. Increased empathy and understanding: By bringing their diverse perspectives to the table, non-citizens can help to increase empathy and understanding within the couple. This can lead to a more inclusive and compassionate relationship.
5. Challenging traditional norms: Non-citens may challenge traditional norms and expectations around marriage and relationships, which can lead to a more progressive and equitable partnership. For example, they may be more open to non-traditional roles or responsibilities within the relationship.
6. Broader worldview: Non-citens may have a broader worldview due to their experiences living in different countries or cultures. This can help to provide a more nuanced understanding of the world and its complexities, which can enrich the couple's relationship.
7. Increased creativity and innovation: The diverse perspectives and experiences of non-citizens can lead to increased creativity and innovation within the couple. They may be able to find new solutions to problems or challenge each other to think outside the box.
8. Greater adaptability: Non-citens may be more adaptable due to their experiences living in different environments. This can help them navigate any challenges
