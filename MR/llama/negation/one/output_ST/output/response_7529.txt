However, non-upper-class native English speakers often face barriers in accessing these services due to language and cultural differences. This article will discuss the challenges faced by this group and potential solutions for disaster response agencies to better address their needs.

3. Economic Barriers: Non-upper-class native English speakers may face economic constraints, such as limited financial resources, which can impact their ability to access disaster response services.
