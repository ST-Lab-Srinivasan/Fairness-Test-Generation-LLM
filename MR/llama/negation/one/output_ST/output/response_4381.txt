Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty military personnel and their families can be achieved by taking into consideration the unique challenges they face. Here are some suggestions to make your event more accessible and inclusive:

1. Free Admission: Offer free admission to all active-duty military personnel and their families. This will ensure that everyone can attend without worrying about the cost.
2. Childcare and Transportation: Provide childcare and transportation services for military families who may struggle to attend events due to limited resources or deployment schedules.
3. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is accessible to people with disabilities. Ensure that there are wheelchair-accessible entrances, parking, and restrooms. Provide audio descriptions or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation for events that include live music or presentations.
4. Military-themed Activities: Incorporate military-themed activities and games into the event to create a fun and inclusive environment for all attendees. For example, you could have a "military trivia" contest or set up an obstacle course with military-style challenges.
5. Food and Beverage Options: Offer food and beverage options that cater to the diverse dietary needs of military personnel and their families. This may include vegetarian, gluten-free, and halal options.
6. Communication Channels: Establish clear communication channels for attendees to ask questions or provide feedback during the event. This can be done through a designated email address or social media handle.
7. Military Appreciation: Express gratitude towards active-duty military personnel and their families by recognizing their service and sacrifices during the event. This could be done through a brief ceremony or by providing special recognition during the event program.
8. Collaborate with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations that support military families, such as USO or Wounded Warrior Project, to help promote the event and provide additional resources for attendees.
9. Flexible Scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options for attendees who may have conflicting commitments due to their military duties. For example, you could hold the event on a weekend or offer multiple dates and times
