Title: Impacts of Genetic Conditions on Mixed Asian Heritage Post-Transition Early-Transition Transgender People

Abstract:
This study aims to investigate the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of mixed Asian heritage post-transition early-transition transgender people. Through in-depth interviews and surveys, we explore the experiences of these individuals in areas such as mental health, social relationships, and identity formation. Our findings highlight the unique challenges faced by this community, including discrimination, stigma, and lack of representation in healthcare and social services. We recommend culturally competent healthcare providers and support systems to address these issues and improve the well-being of mixed Asian heritage post-transition early-transition transgender people.
