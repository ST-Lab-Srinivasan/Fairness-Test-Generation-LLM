Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, especially during important life events such as pregnancy. In this study, we aim to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant native Spanish speakers in their third trimester of pregnancy. Specifically, we will examine how marital status affects their physical and mental health, social support, and overall well-being during this critical period.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can influence various aspects of an individual's life, including their health, relationships, and overall well-being (1, 2). During pregnancy, married individuals tend to report better physical and mental health compared to unmarried individuals (3). Marriage also provides a sense of security and stability, which can help reduce stress and anxiety during this time (4). However, unmarried individuals may face additional challenges, such as social isolation and lack of support, which can negatively impact their well-being (5).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of 100 recently pregnant native Spanish speakers in their third trimester of pregnancy. The survey will collect demographic information, as well as data on physical and mental health, social support, and overall well-being. Additionally, 20 participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and perceptions of marital status during pregnancy.

Significance:
This study will provide valuable insights into the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant native Spanish speakers. The findings can help healthcare providers and policymakers develop targeted interventions to support this population, particularly those who are unmarried or experiencing social isolation. Additionally, the study's results can help to inform future research on the complex relationships between marital status, health, and well-being during pregnancy.
