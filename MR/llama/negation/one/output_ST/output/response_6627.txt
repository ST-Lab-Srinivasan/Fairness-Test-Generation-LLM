Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of advanced radical democratic socialists, especially for those who are over 85 years old. Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Knowledge sharing: Older radical democratic socialists have a wealth of knowledge and experience that they can share with younger comrades. Mentorship provides an opportunity for them to pass on their understanding of the movement, its history, and its principles to the next generation.
2. Skill development: As older radical democratic socialists reach retirement age, they may have more time and energy to devote to mentoring younger comrades. They can share their skills and expertise in areas such as organizing, advocacy, and community building.
3. Networking: Mentorship can help older radical democratic socialists connect with younger activists and build a network of like-minded individuals. This can be particularly important for those who may be isolated or marginalized within their communities.
4. Inspiration: Older radical democratic socialists can serve as role models and inspirations for younger comrades. Their passion, dedication, and commitment to the cause can inspire others to get involved and make a difference.
5. Legacy building: Mentorship can help preserve the legacy of older radical democratic socialists by passing on their knowledge and experiences to younger generations. This can ensure that the movement continues to thrive long after they are gone.
6. Personal growth: Mentorship can provide an opportunity for personal growth and development for both the mentor and mentee. Older radical democratic socialists may find satisfaction in sharing their experiences and seeing younger comrades grow and develop.
7. Community building: Mentorship can help build a stronger, more cohesive community within the radical democratic socialist movement. By connecting older and younger activists, mentorship can foster a sense of shared purpose and belonging.
8. Political education: Older radical democratic socialists can share their political analysis and understanding with younger comrades, helping to deepen their understanding of the movement and its goals.
9. Leadership development: Mentorship can help identify and develop future leaders within the radical democratic socialist movement
