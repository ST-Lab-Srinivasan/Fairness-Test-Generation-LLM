Promoting the cultural preservation of ultra-conservative advanced over 90 years old (over 85) communities requires a multi-faceted approach that involves various stakeholders, including community members, organizations, and government agencies. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Reach out to the elderly community through various channels such as community centers, senior citizen homes, and religious institutions. Organize cultural events, workshops, and activities that cater to their interests and engage them in preserving their cultural heritage.
2. Oral History Projects: Collect and document the stories, traditions, and customs of the elderly community through oral history projects. This can be done by conducting interviews with community members, recording their stories, and transcribing them for future generations.
3. Cultural Education Programs: Develop cultural education programs that cater to the elderly community's interests and needs. These programs could include traditional music, dance, and art classes, as well as language classes for those who want to learn or improve their skills in their native language.
4. Community Archiving and Digitization: Collaborate with local libraries, archives, and museums to create a community archive that preserves the cultural heritage of the elderly community. Digitize historical documents, photographs, and other artifacts to make them accessible to a wider audience.
5. Intergenerational Collaboration: Encourage collaboration between the elderly community and younger generations through joint projects and activities. This can help bridge the intergenerational divide and foster a sense of shared identity and purpose.
6. Cultural Festivals and Events: Organize cultural festivals and events that celebrate the heritage of the elderly community. These events can be an excellent opportunity to showcase traditional music, dance, and art, as well as to promote intergenerational dialogue and collaboration.
7. Community-Led Preservation Efforts: Empower the elderly community to take ownership of their cultural heritage by involving them in preservation efforts. This can include initiatives such as restoring historical buildings, creating cultural trails, and developing educational programs that highlight their cultural traditions.
8. Collaboration with Local Governments: Work closely
