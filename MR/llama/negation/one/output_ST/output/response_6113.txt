To ensure that the voices of native Arabic speakers who are not recently single individuals are heard in decision-making processes, several strategies can be employed:

1. Representation: Ensure that there is adequate representation of native Arabic speakers in decision-making positions, such as on boards of directors or in government agencies. This can be achieved through targeted recruitment and retention efforts.
2. Inclusive language policies: Implement language policies that promote inclusivity and diversity, including the use of Arabic in official communications and decision-making processes.
3. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for native Arabic speakers to develop their leadership and decision-making skills.
4. Community engagement: Engage with local communities and involve them in decision-making processes through mechanisms such as community consultations and participatory governance.
5. Intersectionality: Address the intersecting identities of native Arabic speakers, including their race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status, to ensure that their voices are heard and valued in decision-making processes.
6. Amplifying marginalized voices: Use various tactics such as media campaigns, community outreach programs, and partnerships with organizations that represent marginalized communities to amplify the voices of native Arabic speakers who may not have access to decision-making tables.
7. Decentralization of power: Distribute decision-making powers among various levels of government and civil society organizations to ensure that a diversity of voices are heard and represented.
8. Building alliances: Form alliances with other marginalized groups, such as women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities, to amplify the voices of native Arabic speakers and build collective power.
9. Advocacy and activism: Engage in advocacy and activism efforts to challenge systemic barriers and biases that prevent native Arabic speakers from being heard in decision-making processes.
10. Education and awareness: Educate decision-makers and the broader public about the experiences, perspectives, and contributions of native Arabic speakers, and raise awareness about the importance of inclusive decision-making processes.
