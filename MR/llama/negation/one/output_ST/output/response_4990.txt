Creating more inclusive public spaces for independent Native Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach to design, planning, and implementation. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Involve the Community: Engage with the local community, including independent Native Spanish speakers, to understand their needs and preferences. This can be done through workshops, surveys, or focus groups. Ensure that the voices of these individuals are heard and their perspectives are considered in the design process.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to independent Native Spanish speakers by providing features such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Language Support: Provide multilingual support, including Native American languages, to ensure that all community members can access information and services in their preferred language. Offer interpretation and translation services for those who are non-speakers of the dominant language.
4. Cultural Sensitivity: Design public spaces that respect and reflect the cultural values and practices of independent Native Spanish speakers. This includes incorporating traditional designs, colors, and symbols that are meaningful to these communities.
5. Inclusive Spaces: Create inclusive public spaces that encourage social interaction and community building among independent Native Spanish speakers. This can be achieved by designing spaces with flexible layouts, comfortable seating areas, and access to amenities such as food and beverages.
6. Technology Integration: Leverage technology to improve accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces. For example, provide digital displays or audio announcements in multiple languages to ensure that all community members can access information.
7. Partnerships and Collaborations: Foster partnerships and collaborations between government agencies, community organizations, and independent Native Spanish speakers to co-design and co-deliver public spaces that are inclusive and accessible.
8. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for independent Native Spanish speakers to develop skills in design, planning, and project management. This can help ensure that these individuals are involved in the decision-making process and can contribute to the creation of more inclusive public spaces.
9. Inclusive Urban Planning: Ensure that urban planning policies and practices prioritize the needs of independent Native Spanish speakers
