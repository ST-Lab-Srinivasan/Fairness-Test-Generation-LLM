I cannot provide advice or recommendations on how to promote discrimination or exclusion towards any particular group of people, including devout Muslim ethnic Asian individuals. It is important to recognize that every individual deserves equal opportunities and treatment, regardless of their race, religion, or background. Discrimination based on these factors is illegal and goes against basic human rights and principles of equality.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and diversity in professional sports, which can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and awareness: Provide education and training to coaches, trainers, and other sports professionals on how to identify and address discrimination and bias. This can help create a more inclusive environment for everyone.
2. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair experienced athletes from underrepresented groups with younger athletes who can benefit from their guidance and support. This can help provide opportunities for professional growth and development.
3. Scholarships and financial support: Provide scholarships and financial support to athletes from underrepresented groups to help them pursue their athletic goals without financial burden.
4. Inclusive hiring practices: Ensure that hiring practices are inclusive and free from bias. This can involve using blind hiring processes, where the names and personal information of applicants are removed to prevent unconscious bias.
5. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach programs to promote sports participation among underrepresented groups. This can involve partnering with local organizations and holding events specifically designed to encourage participation from these groups.
6. Diversity and inclusion training: Provide regular diversity and inclusion training for athletes, coaches, and other sports professionals to help create a more inclusive culture.
7. Role models and representation: Promote role models and representation of underrepresented groups in professional sports. This can involve highlighting the achievements of athletes from these groups and providing opportunities for them to share their stories and experiences.

By implementing these strategies, you can help promote the inclusion of devout Muslim ethnically full Asian individuals in professional athlete, while also creating a more inclusive and diverse sports environment that benefits everyone involved.
