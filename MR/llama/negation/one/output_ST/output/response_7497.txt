As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or linguistic background, should be treated with dignity and respect within the legal system.

1. Language barriers: As you mentioned, beginner Chinese speakers may struggle to communicate effectively in a legal setting due to language barriers. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, or missed opportunities for legal advice.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system of many countries has evolved from Western traditions and may not be familiar to beginners from non-Western cultural backgrounds.
