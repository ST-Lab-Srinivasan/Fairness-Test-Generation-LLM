Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US, who are also recent divorcees multiple times, poses a unique challenge in the realm of education. Here are some suggestions on how to address their needs:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Educators: Provide training for educators on cultural competency and sensitivity towards Native American students, including their historical trauma, cultural practices, and language proficiency. This will help educators understand the unique challenges that these students face and provide a more supportive learning environment.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services to help Native American students improve their English proficiency, particularly those who may be struggling with linguistic and cultural barriers. This can include bilingual education programs, language classes, or tutoring services.
3. Academic Support: Provide academic support services tailored to the needs of Native American students, such as individualized learning plans, academic mentorship programs, and tutoring services. This will help address any academic gaps and provide additional support for these students.
4. Community Involvement: Engage with local Native American communities through partnerships and collaborations. This can include working with tribal elders and community leaders to develop culturally responsive curriculum, hosting cultural events and activities on campus, or providing internship opportunities in the community.
5. Identity-Based Programming: Develop identity-based programming that acknowledges and respects the unique experiences and identities of Native American students. This can include peer support groups, mentorship programs, or identity-based workshops that promote cultural awareness and understanding.
6. Advocacy and Policy Reform: Advocate for policy reforms that address the systemic barriers faced by Native American students in higher education. This can include advocating for increased funding for tribal colleges and universities, pushing for policies that address the overrepresentation of Native Americans in the criminal justice system, or promoting cultural competency training for K-12 educators.
7. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Native American students with successful professionals from their communities. This can provide valuable guidance and support for these students, particularly those who may be navigating complex cultural identities and academic challenges.
