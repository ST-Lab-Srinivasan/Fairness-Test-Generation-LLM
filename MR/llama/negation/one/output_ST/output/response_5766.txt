Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of native and recent immigrants to the US, including those who identify as left-leaning. This is especially true for Native American and other marginalized communities, who have been historically oppressed and marginalized in the US. In this essay, we will explore how cultural heritage shapes the identities of recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who identify as left-leaning, and how it informs their political beliefs and actions.

Cultural heritage and identity:
Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, beliefs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular community or group of people. For recent immigrants to the US, their cultural heritage can play a significant role in shaping their identities and political beliefs. For example, if a recent immigrant comes from a country with a strong socialist or communist tradition, they may be more likely to identify as left-leaning and support progressive political ideologies.

On the other hand, if a recent immigrant comes from a country with a history of colonialism or imperialism, they may be more likely to identify as right-leaning and support conservative political ideologies. Additionally, cultural heritage can also inform an individual's relationship with their race, ethnicity, and indigeneity, which can also influence their political beliefs and actions.

Political beliefs and actions:
The political beliefs and actions of recent immigrants to the US are shaped by a variety of factors, including their cultural heritage, socioeconomic status, and experiences with discrimination and inequality. For example, recent immigrants who have experienced discrimination and marginalization may be more likely to identify as left-leaning and support progressive political ideologies that prioritize social justice and equality.

On the other hand, those who have experienced economic success and upward mobility may be more likely to identify as right-leaning and support conservative political ideologies that prioritize individual freedom and limited government intervention in the economy. Additionally, cultural heritage can also inform an individual's relationship with their race, ethnicity, and indigeneity
