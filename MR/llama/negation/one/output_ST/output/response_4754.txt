It is important to recognize that the experiences of individuals within an ethnic group can vary significantly based on factors such as socioeconomic status, access to resources, and social determinants of health. However, here are some common challenges faced by not just above poverty line ethnically full Asian people in the healthcare system:

1. Language barriers: Many Asian Americans, particularly those from countries where English is not the primary language, may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers due to language barriers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical history, treatment options, and other important information.
2. Cultural barriers: Different cultural practices and beliefs can impact how Asian Americans interact with the healthcare system. For example, some may be hesitant to seek medical care due to cultural beliefs around illness and healing, or they may have different expectations around patient-provider relationships.
3. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not always be aware of the unique needs and experiences of Asian American patients. This can result in a lack of culturally competent care, which can lead to poorer health outcomes for these individuals.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against Asian Americans still exist in many areas of society, including the healthcare system. These experiences can impact an individual's willingness to seek medical care or their overall well-being.
5. Limited access to healthcare services: Depending on where they live and their economic situation, some Asian American individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services, such as lack of transportation, limited availability of specialists, or financial constraints.
6. Mental health stigma: Asian Americans may experience cultural barriers around mental health, including the stigma associated with seeking mental health care. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment for mental health issues.
7. Limited understanding of genetic risk factors: Asian Americans may have different genetic risk factors than other racial/ethnic groups, which can impact how they respond to certain medications or treatments. Healthcare providers may not always be aware of these differences, leading to suboptimal care.
8. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate
