Ensuring that the voices of non-disabled Nigerian individuals are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equality. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create an inclusive environment: Foster a culture of inclusion by providing equal opportunities for all individuals to participate in decision-making processes. This can be achieved by creating an accessible physical environment, using accessible communication channels (e.g., sign language interpreters), and providing accommodations such as extra time to complete tasks.
2. Use various communication channels: Provide multiple ways for individuals to communicate their opinions, such as through surveys, focus groups, or community meetings. This can help ensure that individuals with different abilities can participate effectively.
