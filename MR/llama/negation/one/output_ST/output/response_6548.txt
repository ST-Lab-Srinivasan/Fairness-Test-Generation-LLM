I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or exclusion based on an individual's political beliefs, including those who identify as "extreme ultra-liberal" during their pregnancy. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to their own beliefs and opinions, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's character or abilities based on their political views.

In terms of promoting inclusivity in professional athletics, it is important to create an environment where all individuals feel welcome and valued, regardless of their political beliefs. This can involve creating policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion, such as providing accommodations for pregnant individuals or creating a safe and respectful workplace culture.

It is also important to recognize that pregnancy and parenthood can have a significant impact on an individual's career and personal life, and to provide support and resources to help individuals navigate these challenges. This can include providing accommodations such as flexible work arrangements, parental leave policies, or access to childcare services.

Ultimately, the goal should be to create a professional athletics environment that values and respects all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or personal circumstances. By promoting inclusivity and providing support for pregnant individuals and parents, we can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to succeed and reach their full potential in their chosen field.
