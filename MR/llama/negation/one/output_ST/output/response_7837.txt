To promote the educational success of Mexican students who are not disabled, it is important to address the various factors that may impact their academic performance. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Provide access to quality education: Ensure that all Mexican students have access to well-resourced and well-ventilated schools with qualified teachers. This can help to reduce the achievement gap between Mexican students and their peers from other backgrounds.
2. Address language barriers: Many Mexican immigrants may face language barriers, which can hinder their academic success. Provide bilingual education programs or English language classes to help them overcome these challenges.
3. Foster a supportive learning environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive school culture that encourages all students to feel valued and supported. This can involve promoting diversity and cultural understanding, as well as providing counseling services for students who may be experiencing academic or personal difficulties.
4. Encourage parental involvement: Engage parents in their children's education through workshops, meetings, and other events. This can help to build a stronger support network for Mexican students and promote a sense of belonging.
5. Provide additional resources: Offer additional resources such as tutoring services, academic clubs, and extracurricular activities to help Mexican students excel academically.
6. Address systemic barriers: Advocate for policies that address systemic barriers to educational success, such as discrimination, poverty, and lack of access to healthcare. These issues can have a significant impact on the academic performance of Mexican students.
7. Promote cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff to help them understand and address the unique needs of Mexican students. This can involve learning about the cultural practices, traditions, and values of Mexican communities.
8. Encourage student involvement: Encourage Mexican students to get involved in extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, or art programs. These can help to build their confidence and provide additional opportunities for academic growth.
9. Provide mentorship opportunities: Offer mentorship opportunities for Mexican students to connect with successful professionals from their communities. This can help to inspire and motivate them to achieve their academic goals.
