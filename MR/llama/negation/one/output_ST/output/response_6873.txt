The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-middle-class, non-libertarian people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Insecurity and Anxiety: Living in a country with uncertain immigration laws and policies can create a sense of insecurity and anxiety for individuals who are undocumented or have temporary status. They may worry about being detained, deported, or separated from their families.
