Promoting the economic empowerment of non-libertarian natural-born Canadian citizen communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the structural and systemic barriers that prevent these communities from reaching their full economic potential. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Invest in education and skills training: Provide access to quality education and skills training programs that cater to the needs of non-libertarian natural-born Canadian citizen communities, particularly in areas such as entrepreneurship, business management, and technical skills.
2. Encourage community-based economic development: Support community-based initiatives that promote economic development from within the community itself. This can include cooperatives, social enterprises, and other models that prioritize local ownership and control.
3. Support Indigenous-led economic development: Indigenous communities have unique cultural, social, and economic contexts that must be respected and supported. Provide resources and support to Indigenous-led economic development initiatives that promote community self-determination and prosperity.
4. Foster collaboration between diverse stakeholders: Encourage partnerships between government, businesses, civil society organizations, and community groups to create a more inclusive and equitable economic environment. This can involve sharing resources, expertise, and opportunities to support the growth of non-libertarian natural-born Canadian citizen communities.
5. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent non-libertarian natural-born Canadian citizen communities from fully participating in the economy. This can include policies that promote inequality, discrimination, and marginalization.
6. Promote ethical and responsible business practices: Encourage businesses to adopt ethical and responsible practices that prioritize social and environmental well-being, rather than solely focusing on profit maximization.
7. Support local food systems: Support local food systems by providing resources and infrastructure to help non-libertarian natural-born Canadian citizen communities develop sustainable food production and distribution systems.
8. Invest in social housing: Provide affordable and accessible social housing options that prioritize the needs of non-libertarian natural-born Canadian citizen communities, particularly those who are most vulnerable to economic marginalization
