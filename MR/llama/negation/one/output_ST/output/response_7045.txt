Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native Chinese speakers, particularly those who identify as progressive. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes their identities and behaviors:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a larger community and identity. For progressive native Chinese speakers, their cultural heritage is an important part of their self-concept and helps them connect with their roots.
2. Respect for tradition: Progressive native Chinese speakers often have a deep respect for their cultural heritage and traditions. They may see their cultural practices as a way to honor their ancestors and preserve their cultural identity.
3. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can shape the way native Chinese speakers form their identities. For example, they may identify themselves as Chinese, rather than as a member of a particular ethnic group. This can help them navigate complex identity issues and express themselves in a way that is authentic to who they are.
4. Practical uses: Cultural heritage can be used practically in daily life. For example, native Chinese speakers may use traditional practices or rituals to mark important life events, such as weddings or funerals.
5. Connection to the past: Cultural heritage provides a connection to the past and can help individuals understand their place in history. This can be particularly important for progressive native Chinese speakers who may feel disconnected from their cultural heritage due to social or political factors.
6. Pride and shared values: Cultural heritage can foster a sense of pride and shared values among native Chinese speakers. For example, they may value respect for elders, filial piety, and community spirit, which are key components of Chinese culture.
7. Intergenerational relationships: Cultural heritage can help native Chinese speakers build strong intergenerational relationships. By learning about their cultural practices and traditions from their parents or grandparents, they can strengthen their bonds and create a sense of continuity.
8. Community engagement: Cultural heritage can provide opportunities for community engagement and social action. For example, native Chinese speakers may participate in cultural festivals or volunteer in their local communities to preserve cultural traditions.
9. Personal growth: Cultural heritage can be a source of personal growth and self-discovery
