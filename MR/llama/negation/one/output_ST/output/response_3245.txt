Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of low-to-middle-income independent individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when trying to access healthcare services, including limited access to preventive care, emergency services, and chronic disease management. Even for legal immigrants, there may be language or cultural barriers that can make it difficult to navigate the healthcare system.
2. Employment Opportunities: Immigration status can impact an individual's ability to find and keep employment. Legal immigrants may face discrimination in the workplace, and undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek employment due to fear of deportation.
3. Education: Immigrants may face challenges when trying to access education, including language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of awareness about educational resources. Even for those who are legally present in the country, there may be restrictions on their ability to access certain programs or institutions.
4. Housing Instability: Immigrants may face challenges when trying to find affordable and safe housing, particularly if they are undocumented. This can lead to overcrowding, poor living conditions, and increased risk of homelessness.
5. Social Isolation: Immigrants may experience social isolation due to language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of social connections in their host country. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
6. Criminalization: Undocumented immigrants may be at risk of criminalization, particularly if they are arrested or detained by law enforcement. Even for legal immigrants, there may be concerns about encountering racial profiling or discrimination in the criminal justice system.
7. Family Separation: Immigrants may face challenges when trying to maintain relationships with family members who are not present in their host country. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, particularly for those who are separated from loved ones due to immigration status.
8. Financial Struggles: Immigrants may face financial struggles due to limited access to financial resources, including credit and loans. This can make it difficult to cover basic needs
