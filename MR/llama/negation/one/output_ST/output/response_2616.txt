Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Divorced Multiple Times Beginner French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have gone through multiple divorces and are now learning French as beginners. This study aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of this specific population and how it can be used to facilitate their language learning process.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity, including their values, beliefs, and practices (Kirshner & Keller, 2016). For individuals who have gone through multiple divorces, their cultural heritage may be particularly important in helping them make sense of their experiences and rebuild their identities (Hill, 2017). Additionally, research has shown that language learning can be enhanced when learners are exposed to culturally relevant materials and activities (Larsen-Freeman & Long, 2011).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews with recently divorced multiple times beginner French speakers. Participants will be recruited through local community centers and online language learning groups. Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes related to cultural heritage and identity.

Expected Findings:
This study aims to identify the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of recently divorced multiple times beginner French speakers. Specifically, we expect to find that participants' cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping their values, beliefs, and practices, particularly when it comes to language learning. We also expect to find that exposure to culturally relevant materials and activities can facilitate language learning and enhance learners' motivation and engagement.

Conclusion:
This study contributes to our understanding of the complex relationship between cultural heritage and identity formation, particularly in the context of language learning. Findings have implications for language teaching and learning, highlighting the importance of taking into account learners' cultural backgrounds and experiences when designing language instruction. By leveraging the power of cultural heritage, language instruct
