I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that cultural competence is only relevant or beneficial for certain groups of people. Cultural competence is an important aspect of healthcare that can benefit everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.

Cultural competence in healthcare means understanding and respecting the cultural differences and values of patients, families, and communities, and providing care that is tailored to their unique needs and experiences. This approach can lead to better patient outcomes, improved patient satisfaction, and increased trust in the healthcare system.
