Mentorship plays a significant role in the success of communist poor individuals in several ways:

1. Guidance and Support: A mentor can provide guidance and support to help the mentee navigate the complexities of living in a capitalist society as a member of a marginalized group. They can offer advice on how to manage finances, find affordable housing, and access healthcare.
2. Networking Opportunities: A mentor can introduce the mentee to their professional and personal networks, which can provide valuable connections for future opportunities. This can include introductions to potential employers, colleagues, or community leaders who can help advance the mentee's career or social justice causes.
3. Personal Development: A mentor can help the mentee identify their strengths and weaknesses, set achievable goals, and develop a plan to achieve those goals. This can include providing feedback on the mentee's skills and abilities, as well as encouraging them to take risks and challenge themselves outside of their comfort zone.
4. Empowerment: A mentor can empower the mentee by providing them with the knowledge and skills they need to advocate for themselves and their community. This can include teaching them how to communicate effectively, negotiate with power structures, and mobilize others around social justice causes.
5. Role Modeling: A mentor can serve as a role model by demonstrating what it means to be a committed and dedicated member of a marginalized group. They can show the mentee how to navigate difficult situations with integrity and compassion, and provide an example of how to live a meaningful life despite facing oppression.
6. Advocacy: A mentor can advocate for the mentee's needs and interests within their own organization or community. They can help the mentee access resources and support that they may not have otherwise had, such as funding, media attention, or political influence.
7. Career Advancement: A mentor can help the mentee advance their career by providing guidance on how to navigate the workplace, build professional networks, and develop the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in their field.
8. Personal Growth: A mentor can help the mentee grow personally by encouraging them to reflect on their experiences
