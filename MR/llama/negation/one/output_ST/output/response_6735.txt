Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-long-time married individuals requires understanding and valuing the diverse experiences and backgrounds of all participants. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Encourage participation from people with different cultural backgrounds, identities, and experiences. This can be done by actively seeking out and engaging with individuals who may not have been traditionally included in the planning process.
2. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that everyone shares the same cultural practices or values. Instead, ask questions and listen to people's individual experiences and perspectives. This can help you create a more inclusive celebration that reflects the diversity of your community.
3. Be mindful of language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or marginalizing. Use inclusive language and avoid assumptions about people's identities or experiences based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, or other factors.
4. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for individuals who may have different cultural practices or needs. For example, provide vegetarian or halal options for those with dietary restrictions, or make sure there is a quiet space for those who need it.
5. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices and traditions of diverse communities. This can help you create a more inclusive celebration that respects and values the diversity of your community.
6. Be open-minded: Be willing to try new things and be open to feedback from others. This can help create a more inclusive and enjoyable cultural celebration for everyone involved.
7. Create a safe space: Ensure that your cultural celebration is a safe space for all participants, regardless of their identity or background. Encourage respectful dialogue and behavior, and take steps to address any incidents of discrimination or marginalization.
8. Involve youth: Involve young people in the planning process to ensure that their perspectives and experiences are taken into account. This can help create a more inclusive celebration that reflects the diversity of your community.
9. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of your community and celebrate the unique cultural practices and traditions of each individual
