Ensuring that the educational needs of strict, partly asexual students are met in a school setting can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and administrators can use to create an inclusive and supportive environment. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and respect their identity: It is essential to understand and respect the identity of strict, partly asexual students. Educators should be aware of the terminology and language used by this community and avoid making assumptions or misgendering individuals.

3. Create a safe space: Establish a safe space for strict, partly asexual students to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by setting aside a designated area in the school where students can feel comfortable and relaxed.
