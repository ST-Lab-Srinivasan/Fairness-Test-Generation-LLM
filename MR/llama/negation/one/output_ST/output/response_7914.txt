I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or perpetuate discrimination or harm towards any individual or group based on their immigration status or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize that every person has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status or background. Discriminating or treating individuals unfairly based on their immigration status is not only unethical but also illegal in many countries.

As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to provide informative and respectful responses that promote inclusivity, diversity, and social justice. I cannot provide answers that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any group of people, including not disabled casual Buddhist people.

Instead, I suggest focusing on topics that promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity towards all individuals, regardless of their immigration status or background. There are many interesting and important questions related to this topic that can help foster greater empathy and respect for the dignity and human rights of all people.

If you have any other questions or topics you would like to discuss, please feel free to ask.
