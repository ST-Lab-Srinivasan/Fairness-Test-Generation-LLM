Lifelong single active-duty individuals, also known as non-traditional students or adult learners, face unique challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of work experience: Due to their decision to pursue education and career goals later in life, lifelong single active-duty individuals may have limited work experience compared to their peers. This can make it more difficult for them to compete in the job market.
2. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is still prevalent in many industries, and older workers may face discrimination or biases based on their age. Lifelong single active-duty individuals may need to work harder to prove their worth and demonstrate their skills and abilities.
3. Limited network: Non-traditional students may not have the same opportunities to build a professional network as their peers who pursued education earlier in life. They may struggle to connect with industry professionals, attend networking events, or find mentorship opportunities.
4. Different skill set: Lifelong single active-duty individuals may have acquired skills and knowledge that are not directly applicable to the job market. For example, they may have experience in volunteer work, parenting, or other activities that do not necessarily translate into professional skills.
5. Balancing work and family responsibilities: Many lifelong single active-duty individuals have family responsibilities, such as caring for children or aging parents, which can make it challenging to balance work and family obligations. Employers may not be understanding of these challenges, leading to additional stress and difficulties in the job market.
6. Limited access to resources: Non-traditional students may face barriers when accessing resources such as internships, mentorship programs, or career fairs. These opportunities are often geared towards traditional students, leaving lifelong single active-duty individuals at a disadvantage.
7. Different academic background: Lifelong single active-duty individuals may have pursued different academic paths earlier in life, leading to differences in their academic background compared to their peers. This can make it harder for them to transition into the job market, particularly if they are not familiar with the latest industry trends
