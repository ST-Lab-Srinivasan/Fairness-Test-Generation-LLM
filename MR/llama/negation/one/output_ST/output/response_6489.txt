3. Fostering empathy and respect: Cultural exchange programs can help to foster empathy and respect between different communities. By engaging in activities and events that promote cross-cultural understanding, individuals can develop a deeper appreciation for each other's experiences and perspectives. For example, recent immigrant groups may learn about the challenges faced by native Chinese speaker immigrants when integrating into US society, while native Chinese speaker immigrants may learn about the resilience and resourcefulness of recent immigrant groups.
4. Promoting language learning: Cultural exchange programs can provide opportunities for individuals to learn each other's languages.
