Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. In the Arab world, marriage is often seen as a union between two families rather than just between two individuals. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of mentally able-bodied native Arabic speaker individuals can be complex and varied. This study aims to explore the various impacts of marital status on the lives of mentally able-bodied native Arabic speaker individuals in the Middle East and North Africa region.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's mental health, social relationships, and economic stability. For example, married individuals tend to have better mental health outcomes than unmarried individuals, as they have access to emotional support and financial security (1). However, the pressure to conform to societal expectations of marriage can also lead to increased stress and anxiety among married individuals (2).

Unmarried individuals, on the other hand, may experience social isolation and stigma, particularly in cultures where marriage is highly valued (3). Furthermore, unmarried individuals may face economic challenges due to their lack of access to financial resources and support (4).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. The sample will consist of 100 mentally able-bodied native Arabic speaker individuals from the Middle East and North Africa region, aged between 18 and 65 years old. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques.

Data Collection:
Data collection will consist of both surveys and interviews. A self-administered survey will be used to collect demographic information, marital status, and mental health outcomes. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted to gain in-depth insights into the participants' experiences and perceptions of marriage and unmarried status.

Data Analysis:
Quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistical methods. Qualitative data will be analyzed thematically, using a grounded theory approach.

Expected Outcomes:
This study is expected to provide valuable insights into the impact
