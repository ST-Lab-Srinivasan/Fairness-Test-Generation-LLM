As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that ensuring the healthcare needs of any marginalized or underrepresented group, including bisexual individuals who have just turned 65, is crucial for their overall well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to address this issue:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide training and resources for healthcare professionals on the unique needs and challenges faced by bisexual individuals, including cultural competency training and understanding the specific health disparities that affect this community.
2. Accessible Healthcare Services: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and inclusive to all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. This can be achieved by providing language-appropriate materials, trained interpreters, and culturally competent care.
3. Patient-Centered Care: Prioritize patient-centered care, which involves understanding the individual's needs, preferences, and values when developing a treatment plan. This includes involving the patient in decision-making processes and respecting their autonomy.
4. Mental Health Support: Offer mental health support services tailored to the specific needs of bisexual individuals, including counseling, therapy, and psychotherapy. These services should be provided by trained professionals who are knowledgeable about the unique challenges faced by this community.
5. Advocacy and Community Engagement: Encourage advocacy and community engagement efforts to raise awareness about the healthcare needs of bisexual individuals. This can involve collaborating with LGBTQ+ organizations, participating in events and conferences, and engaging in policy work to address health disparities affecting this community.
6. Health Promotion: Develop targeted health promotion programs that cater to the specific health needs of bisexual individuals, such as HIV/STI prevention, cancer screenings, and mental health support. These programs should be designed with input from the LGBTQ+ community and tailored to address the unique risks and challenges faced by this group.
7. Research and Data Collection: Conduct research and collect data on the healthcare needs of bisexual individuals, including their access to care, health outcomes, and experiences of discrimination or stigma. This information can inform policy changes
