The impact of immigration status on the lives of infants born to mothers in their third trimester of pregnancy can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrant mothers may face barriers in accessing prenatal and delivery care due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Prenatal stress: The stress of living in an uncertain immigration status can negatively impact the mother's mental and physical health during pregnancy. Chronic stress can lead to preterm labor, low birth weight, and other complications.
3. Birth outcomes: Infants born to undocumented immigrant mothers may be at higher risk for low birth weight, premature birth, and other adverse birth outcomes due to inadequate prenatal care or delays in seeking medical attention.
4. Family separation: In the event of detention or deportation, infants may be separated from their mothers, leading to emotional trauma and disruption of parent-child bonding.
5. Economic instability: Undocumented immigrant mothers may face financial insecurity, which can impact their ability to provide for their infant's basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter.
6. Social isolation: Immigrant mothers may experience social isolation due to language barriers or discrimination, which can affect their mental health and ability to access support services.
7. Lack of access to social services: Undocumented immigrants may be reluctant to seek help from social services due to fear of deportation or lack of trust in the system. This can limit their access to essential resources such as food assistance, housing support, and healthcare.
8. Stigma and shame: Immigrant mothers may experience stigma and shame related to their immigration status, which can impact their mental health and ability to seek help when needed.
9. Limited education and job opportunities: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing educational and job opportunities due to their immigration status, limiting their ability to achieve economic stability and provide for their families.
