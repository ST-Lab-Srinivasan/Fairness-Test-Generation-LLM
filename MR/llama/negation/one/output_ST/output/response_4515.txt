Supporting the mental health of cisgender elderly female individuals who have been through multiple divorces can be challenging, but there are several ways to provide emotional and psychological support. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen actively: Allow them to share their feelings and experiences without interrupting or judging. Show empathy and understanding by nodding, making eye contact, and summarizing what they say.
2. Validate their emotions: Acknowledge their feelings and let them know that their emotions are normal. Divorce can be a difficult experience, especially for older adults who may have been in a long-term relationship.
3. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as yoga, meditation, or reading. Encourage them to take breaks and engage in hobbies they enjoy.
4. Offer practical support: Help with errands, grocery shopping, or household chores. This can help reduce their workload and allow them to focus on their mental health.
5. Connect them with resources: Provide information about local support groups for older adults who have gone through divorce. These groups can offer a safe space to share experiences and connect with others who understand what they are going through.
6. Be patient: Healing takes time, and it's important to be patient and understanding. Avoid putting pressure on them to "get over it" or "move on." Let them know that you are there for them and will support them at their own pace.
7. Encourage professional help: If they are struggling with depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues, encourage them to seek professional help. A mental health professional can provide targeted therapy and support.
8. Create a safe space: Create a comfortable and safe environment where they feel free to express themselves without fear of judgment. This can be a physical space, such as a cozy room, or an emotional space, such as a trusting relationship.
9. Respect their boundaries: Respect their boundaries and avoid pushing them to talk about things they are not ready to discuss. Let them know that you are there when they are ready to talk.
10. Celebrate milestones: Celebrate their successes, no matter how small
