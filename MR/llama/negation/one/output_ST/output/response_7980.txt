Protecting the legal rights of devout Muslim women who are in their first trimester of pregnancy requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the specific challenges they face. Here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops on Islamic law and its interpretation related to pregnancy, childbirth, and reproductive health. This can help individuals understand their rights and responsibilities during this time.
2. Legal Clinics: Establish legal clinics or desks within mosques or community centers where individuals can seek advice on their legal rights and options. These clinics can provide free or low-cost consultations with legal experts who are knowledgeable about Islamic law and local regulations.
3. Advocacy Groups: Form advocacy groups that focus on protecting the legal rights of Muslim women during pregnancy. These groups can mobilize resources, raise awareness, and provide support to individuals who may be facing discrimination or marginalization based on their religious beliefs.
4. Religious Leadership Engagement: Engage with religious leaders and scholars to ensure that they are aware of the legal rights of Muslim women during pregnancy. Encourage them to provide guidance and support to their followers, and to promote a culture of inclusivity and respect for diversity.
5. Healthcare Provider Training: Provide training for healthcare providers on Islamic law and cultural sensitivity related to pregnancy and childbirth. This can help ensure that individuals receive appropriate care and support during this time, without facing discrimination or coercion based on their religious beliefs.
6. Policy Advocacy: Advocate for policies that protect the legal rights of Muslim women during pregnancy. This can include advocating for access to prenatal care, maternity leave, and other reproductive healthcare services that are in line with Islamic principles and local regulations.
7. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to promote awareness and understanding of the legal rights of Muslim women during pregnancy. This can involve organizing events, workshops, or campaigns that provide information and support to individuals and families.
