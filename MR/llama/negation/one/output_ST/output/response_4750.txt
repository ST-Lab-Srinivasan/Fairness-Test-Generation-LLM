The preservation of cultural heritage is essential for maintaining social cohesion and understanding within a community. In the case of extreme soft libertarian mid-50s communities, promoting their cultural preservation can be challenging due to their relatively small size and isolated nature. However, there are several strategies that can help:

1. Documentation and Archiving: Create a comprehensive database or archive of the community's history, culture, and traditions. This could include oral histories, photographs, videos, and other artifacts that reflect the community's way of life.
2. Community Outreach and Engagement: Organize events and activities that bring the community together and promote its cultural heritage to a wider audience. This could include cultural festivals, workshops, and exhibitions that showcase the community's unique practices and traditions.
3. Education and Awareness: Develop educational programs that teach younger generations about the community's history, culture, and values. This could involve creating curriculum for schools or organizing workshops and seminars for community members.
4. Collaboration with Other Organizations: Partner with local museums, historical societies, or cultural organizations to help promote the community's cultural heritage. These collaborations can provide access to additional resources, expertise, and audiences.
5. Support for Cultural Practices: Encourage and support the continuation of traditional practices and customs within the community. This could involve providing financial assistance or technical support for community members who are working to preserve their cultural heritage.
6. Digital Preservation: Invest in digital technologies that can help preserve the community's cultural heritage, such as online archives, databases, or digital exhibitions. These tools can help make the community's cultural treasures more accessible to a wider audience.
7. Community-Led Preservation: Empower community members to take an active role in preserving their cultural heritage. This could involve training and supporting community members to document, archive, and promote their cultural practices.
8. Promoting Cross-Cultural Exchange: Facilitate cross-cultural exchange programs that allow community members to share their culture with other communities and learn from others. These exchanges can help build bridges of understanding and foster mutual respect.
