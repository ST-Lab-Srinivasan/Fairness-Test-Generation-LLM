Creating more inclusive recreational activities for active-duty nominal Muslims can be achieved by considering the following suggestions:

1. Provide Halal food options: Many Muslim service members may have dietary restrictions, making it difficult to participate in recreational activities that serve non-halal food. Offering Halal options can help ensure that everyone feels included and comfortable.
2. Create separate spaces for men and women: In many Muslim cultures, there are specific spaces designated for men and women. Providing separate areas for each gender can help create a more inclusive environment and respect cultural norms.
3. Offer prayer facilities: Muslim service members may need to perform daily prayers. Providing prayer facilities or designating a quiet area where they can perform their prayers can help them feel included and supported.
4. Develop age-appropriate activities: Many Muslim children may have limited opportunities for recreational activities due to cultural norms or lack of access. Designing activities that are age-appropriate and enjoyable for children can help create a more inclusive environment.
5. Incorporate Islamic values: Incorporating Islamic values such as respect, compassion, and justice into recreational activities can help create a more inclusive environment and promote cross-cultural understanding.
6. Provide cultural sensitivity training for staff: Training staff on cultural sensitivities and Islamic practices can help ensure that they are aware of the needs of Muslim service members and can provide appropriate support.
7. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Encouraging interfaith dialogue and understanding between different religious groups can help create a more inclusive environment and promote cross-cultural understanding.
8. Offer religious services: Providing religious services such as Islamic prayers, Jumu'ah, or other religious events can help Muslim service members feel included and supported.
9. Create a mentorship program: Creating a mentorship program that pairs Muslim service members with more experienced individuals from their own culture can help them navigate the military environment and feel more included.
10. Provide cultural-sensitive counseling: Providing cultural-sensitive counseling services can help Muslim service members address any mental health concerns they may have related to their cultural identity.
