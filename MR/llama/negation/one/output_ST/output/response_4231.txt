Creating more inclusive social policies for moderate-income trans individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges and barriers faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities, including moderate-income trans individuals. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" and "women") and instead use gender-neutral language (e.g., "everyone," "all genders").
2. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that moderate-income trans individuals have access to quality healthcare services, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries. This can be achieved by expanding insurance coverage to include these services and creating sliding scale fees for those who cannot afford them.
3. Legal Recognition: Advocate for legal recognition of moderate-income trans individuals, including the right to change their legal gender marker without undergoing expensive and invasive surgical procedures. This can be achieved through policy changes at the local, state, or federal level.

5. Economic Empowerment: Advocate for policies that address the economic challenges faced by moderate-income trans individuals, including access to affordable housing, credit, and financial services. This can be achieved through policy changes at the local, state, or federal level.
6. Community Engagement: Engage with moderate-income trans communities to understand their specific needs and develop policies that address them. This can involve participating in community events, conducting focus groups, and surveying members of the community.

Policies should be designed to address the unique challenges faced by moderate-income trans individuals of color, those living in poverty, or those with disabilities.
8. Capacity Building: Provide training and
