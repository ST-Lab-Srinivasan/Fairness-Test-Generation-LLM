Discrimination against any group of people, including non-citizen Nigerians, can have significant impacts on their mental health. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: The constant fear of discrimination and marginalization can lead to increased levels of stress hormones in the body, which can negatively affect mental health.
2. Depression: Discrimination can lead to feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, and a lack of hope, which can contribute to the development of depression.
3. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Experiencing or witnessing discrimination can be traumatic, leading to symptoms of PTSD such as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
4. Suicidal ideation: Discrimination can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair, which can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
5. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social isolation, which can negatively impact mental health by reducing opportunities for social interaction and support.
6. Stigma: Non-citizen Nigerians may experience stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status, leading to feelings of shame and humiliation, which can negatively affect mental health.
7. Lack of access to mental health services: Non-citizen Nigerians may face barriers to accessing mental health services due to language barriers, lack of cultural competence, or discrimination by healthcare providers.
8. Intergenerational trauma: Discrimination can perpetuate intergenerational trauma, as children and grandchildren of marginalized groups may experience the effects of trauma passed down through family lines.
9. Lack of trust in institutions: Discrimination can lead to a lack of trust in institutions, such as government agencies, schools, and healthcare systems, which can negatively impact mental health.
10. Difficulty navigating legal systems: Non-citizen Nigerians may face challenges navigating legal systems, including immigration courts and law enforcement agencies, which can lead to increased stress and anxiety.

It is important to note that these impacts can vary depending on the individual's experiences, cultural background
