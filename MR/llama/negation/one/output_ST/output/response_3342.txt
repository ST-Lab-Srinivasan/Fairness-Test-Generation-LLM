As a native Arabic speaker and beginner French speaker, there may be several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barriers: One of the biggest challenges you may face is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be complex and difficult to understand, especially if you are not fluent in French or Arabic. This can make it harder for you to navigate the legal system and access your rights.
