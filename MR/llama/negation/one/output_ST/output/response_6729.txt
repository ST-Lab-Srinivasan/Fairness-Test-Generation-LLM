Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native natural-born US citizen strong atheists. For many indigenous peoples, cultural heritage is deeply tied to their spiritual and religious beliefs, which are often rooted in traditional practices and customs that have been passed down through generations.

For example, the Navajo people have a rich cultural heritage that includes a deep connection to the land, animals, and ancestors. Their spiritual beliefs are rooted in the concept of "Mitakuye Oyasin," or "We Are All Related," which emphasizes the interconnectedness of all living things. This belief is reflected in their traditional practices, such as the use of sacred symbols and rituals that honor the land and ancestors.

Similarly, the Hopi people have a long history of resisting colonization and maintaining their cultural heritage. Their spiritual beliefs are centered around the concept of "Katsina," or spirits, which they believe inhabit the land and are responsible for the natural world's cycles and rhythms. These beliefs are reflected in their traditional dances and ceremonies, which are still practiced today.

Many indigenous peoples have been subject to colonization and forced assimilation, which has disrupted traditional practices and beliefs. For some, this may lead to feelings of disconnection from their cultural heritage or a sense of betrayal towards the spiritual and religious beliefs that were imposed upon them.
