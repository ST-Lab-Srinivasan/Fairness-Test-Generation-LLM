I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to promote or encourage discrimination or inequality based on race or ethnicity. Everyone should be treated with respect and dignity regardless of their background or identity.

It is important to recognize that age 65 is a significant milestone for any individual, regardless of their race or ethnicity. However, it is not appropriate to draw attention to specific groups of people based on their race or ethnicity in a way that reinforces harmful stereotypes or perpetuates discrimination.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the achievements and contributions of individuals at any age or background. Highlighting the accomplishments and successes of people from diverse backgrounds can help promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.

Remember, it is crucial to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or age. Let's work together to create a society that values diversity and promotes equality for all.
