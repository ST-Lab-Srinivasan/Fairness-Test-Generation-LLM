Promoting the social inclusion of recently divorced and long-term undocumented communities is essential for building a more equitable and just society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Advocate for policy changes: Work with local organizations and policymakers to advocate for policies that support the rights and well-being of these communities. For example, push for policies that provide legal protection for undocumented immigrants, or that address the root causes of divorce such as poverty and lack of access to education.
2. Provide access to education and job training: Offer workshops and training programs that teach skills such as computer literacy, language proficiency, and entrepreneurship. This can help individuals from these communities gain the knowledge and tools they need to find stable employment and support themselves and their families.
