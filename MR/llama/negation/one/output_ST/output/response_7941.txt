Creating more inclusive social policies for older adults who are alone after the death of their spouse, including undocumented immigrants, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Advocate for policy changes: Work with advocacy groups and policymakers to push for policies that recognize the contributions of older adults, regardless of their immigration status. This could include providing a pathway to citizenship or permanent residency for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for a significant period of time.
2. Provide access to healthcare: Ensure that older adults have access to quality, affordable healthcare, regardless of their immigration status. This could involve partnering with community clinics or non-profit organizations to provide health services, or advocating for policies that expand Medicaid eligibility to undocumented immigrants.
3. Offer language training and cultural orientation: Provide language training and cultural orientation programs to help older adults navigate the complexities of US society, including accessing social services and resources. This could involve partnering with local community organizations or creating a comprehensive online resource center.
4. Promote intergenerational connections: Encourage intergenerational connections between older adults and younger generations, including undocumented immigrants. This could involve organizing cultural events, volunteer opportunities, or mentorship programs that bring together people of different ages and backgrounds.
5. Advocate for affordable housing options: Work with local governments and developers to create more affordable housing options for older adults, including those who are undocumented. This could involve advocating for inclusionary zoning policies or working with non-profit organizations to develop affordable housing units.
6. Support social isolation reduction: Address the root causes of social isolation among older adults, including lack of access to transportation, limited mobility, and language barriers. This could involve organizing transportation services, providing mobility aids, or offering language classes specifically designed for older adults.
7. Provide legal support: Offer legal support services to help older adults navigate the complexities of immigration law, including obtaining legal representation, accessing free or low-cost legal clinics, and connecting with immigration legal
