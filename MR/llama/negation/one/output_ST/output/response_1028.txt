As a non-binary person, I can provide some insights into the challenges faced by partially identifying as non-binary individuals in the healthcare system during late pregnancy (third trimester). Keep in mind that every person's experience is unique, and these are general observations based on my own research and conversations with other non-binary individuals.

1. Misgendering: Non-binary individuals may face the issue of being misgendered by healthcare providers, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy towards their identity. This can be particularly challenging during pregnancy when the healthcare provider may assume the person's gender identity based on societal expectations.
2. Inadequate care: Non-binary individuals may not receive adequate care due to the healthcare system's lack of understanding and experience in dealing with non-binary patients. This can result in a delay or omission of necessary medical procedures, which can have serious consequences for both the pregnant person and their baby.
3. Lack of inclusive language: Healthcare providers may use binary language when discussing the patient's pregnancy, which can be alienating and invalidating for non-binary individuals. Using gendered language can make the patient feel marginalized and unheard, leading to a lack of trust in the healthcare system.
4. Inadequate support: Non-binary individuals may not receive sufficient emotional or practical support during pregnancy due to societal expectations and the healthcare system's limited understanding of non-binary identities. This can lead to feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression.
5. Difficulty accessing care: Non-binary individuals may face barriers in accessing prenatal care or other medical services due to discrimination, lack of knowledge about their identity, or a lack of inclusive policies within the healthcare system. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the pregnant person and their baby.
6. Lack of representation: Non-binary individuals may feel underrepresented or unseen within the healthcare system, leading to a lack of trust and sense of belonging. This can result in lower adherence to medical advice, which can have serious consequences for both the pregnant person and their
