As a high society temporary visa holder, you may face several challenges when accessing healthcare services in the UK. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Lack of understanding of the NHS: As a non-UK citizen, you may not be familiar with the National Health Service (NHS) and its policies. This can lead to confusion about how to access healthcare services or what is covered under your temporary visa.
2. Language barriers: If English is not your first language, you may struggle to communicate effectively with healthcare professionals, which can lead to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
3. Limited knowledge of the healthcare system: You may not be aware of the different types of healthcare providers available in the UK, such as general practitioners (GPs), hospitals, and specialist clinics. This can make it difficult to navigate the healthcare system and access the appropriate care.
4. Difficulty accessing specialist care: As a temporary visa holder, you may face challenges in accessing specialist care, such as consultants or specialists, who may be booked up for weeks or months in advance. This can lead to delays in receiving necessary medical treatment.
5. Cost concerns: Depending on your visa status, you may be responsible for the full cost of healthcare services, including prescriptions and treatments. This can be a significant financial burden, particularly if you are not covered by a UK-based insurance plan.
6. Difficulty accessing urgent care: If you need urgent medical attention outside of regular clinic hours, you may face challenges in accessing care, particularly if you do not have a GP or are not familiar with the local healthcare services.
7. Lack of continuity of care: As a temporary visa holder, you may find it difficult to establish a relationship with a GP or other healthcare professionals, which can lead to gaps in your medical history and treatment.

9. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there can be a stigma attached to seeking healthcare
