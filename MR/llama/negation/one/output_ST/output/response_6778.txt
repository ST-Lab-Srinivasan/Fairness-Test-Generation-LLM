Creating more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-millionaire individuals requires a deliberate and systematic approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Address income inequality: Implement progressive taxation policies to reduce wealth disparities and redistribute wealth to those who need it most. This can be achieved through policies such as increasing taxes on the wealthy, implementing a living wage, and providing financial assistance to low-income families.
2. Increase access to affordable housing: Implement policies that make housing more affordable for low-income individuals and families, such as rent control, subsidized housing programs, and support for community land trusts.
3. Strengthen social safety nets: Ensure that social safety nets are adequately funded and provide comprehensive coverage for essential needs such as healthcare, education, and basic income support.
4. Promote access to quality education: Implement policies that improve access to quality education for low-income individuals and families, such as universal pre-kindergarten, need-based financial aid for higher education, and targeted interventions in under-resourced schools.
5. Support community development: Invest in community development programs that promote economic mobility and social inclusion, such as microfinance initiatives, job training programs, and community-led revitalization projects.
6. Address systemic barriers to employment: Identify and address systemic barriers to employment for marginalized groups, such as discrimination, lack of access to transportation, and inadequate childcare support.
7. Foster inclusive decision-making processes: Ensure that marginalized communities have a voice in policy-making processes through participatory governance models, community engagement, and advocacy initiatives.
8. Support mental health and well-being: Provide access to mental health services and promote holistic well-being for low-income individuals and families, particularly those who have experienced trauma or adversity.
9. Advocate for policies that address the root causes of poverty: Address the systemic issues that contribute to poverty, such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources and opportunities.
10. Engage in ongoing monitoring and evaluation
