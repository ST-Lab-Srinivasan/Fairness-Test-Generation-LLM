Ensuring that the educational needs of financially disadvantaged young adults in their 20s are met requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various aspects of education, including access, affordability, and quality. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Scholarships and grants: Provide financial assistance through scholarships, grants, and other forms of aid to help young adults cover the costs of tuition, fees, and living expenses. This can include government-funded programs, such as Pell Grants, as well as private scholarships and foundations.
