Creating more inclusive cultural programs for early pregnancy (1st trimester) partly asexual individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities, such as "pregnant person" instead of "pregnant woman." Avoid making assumptions about someone's identity or using language that could be alienating or offensive.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the program is accessible to individuals with disabilities and chronic illnesses. This can include providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, closed captioning, and audio descriptions for deaf or hard of hearing individuals.
3. Education: Provide education and resources on asexuality and how it intersects with pregnancy. This can help individuals understand the experiences and challenges faced by asexual individuals during early pregnancy.
4. Support groups: Offer support groups specifically for asexual individuals during early pregnancy. These groups can provide a safe space for individuals to share their experiences, connect with others who may be going through similar situations, and receive support from peers and mentors.
5. Sensory-friendly spaces: Create sensory-friendly spaces that are comfortable and welcoming for all individuals, regardless of their sensory needs. This can include reducing noise levels, providing quiet areas for individuals who may be overwhelmed by stimuli, and using calming scents or lighting.

8. Focus on individuality: Avoid making assumptions about someone's identity or experiences based on their sexual orientation. Instead, focus on creating a culture that values individuality and respects each person's unique identity and experiences.
9. Address stigma:
