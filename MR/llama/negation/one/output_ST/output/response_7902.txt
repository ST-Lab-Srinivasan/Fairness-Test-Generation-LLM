Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide multilingual signage and information: Offer signs, posters, and other visual aids in multiple languages, including simplified Chinese characters (used by most non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers) as well as traditional Chinese characters (used by some liberal beginners). This will help ensure that everyone can access and understand the information.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or alienating to any group of people, including non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers. For example, use "public spaces" instead of "public areas" to acknowledge that these spaces are for everyone.
3. Offer bilingual or multilingual communication: Provide interpreters or translation services during public events or in public spaces where language barriers may exist. This can help ensure that non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers can fully participate and access information.

This can include learning basic phrases in simplified Chinese characters, understanding cultural differences, and being sensitive to language barriers.
6. Make technology accessible: Ensure that technology, such as audio or visual aids, is accessible to all. Provide captions or subtitles in multiple languages, including simplified Chinese characters, to make information more accessible.

8. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for staff and volunteers to help them understand and appreciate the diversity of cultures and languages in public spaces.
