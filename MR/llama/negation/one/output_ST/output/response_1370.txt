Native Arabic speakers with a mixed Asian heritage may face unique challenges in the legal system due to their intersecting identities. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

1. Lack of representation: Mixed-heritage individuals may feel underrepresented in legal proceedings, as many legal professionals and interpreters may not be familiar with the cultural nuances of their mixed identity.
