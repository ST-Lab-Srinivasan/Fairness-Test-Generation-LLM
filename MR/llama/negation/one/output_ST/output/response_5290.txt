As a non-native English and French speaker, I can provide some general insights into the challenges that beginner learners of these languages may face when interacting with the legal system. Please keep in mind that these are common challenges, but they may vary depending on the individual's level of proficiency and the specific context.

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for beginner English and French speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology can be complex and technical, and it may be difficult to understand and communicate effectively without a strong grasp of the language.
2. Cultural differences: The legal systems in English-speaking countries and France have some cultural differences that can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
