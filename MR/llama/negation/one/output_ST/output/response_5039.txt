5. Social support: Connect individuals with a network of peers and mentors who can provide emotional support and guidance during times of financial stress.
6. Government support: Advocate for policies that promote financial stability, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing options, and access to affordable healthcare.

8. Entrepreneurship: Encourage individuals to start their own businesses or side hustles, which can provide a source of income and help them build wealth over time.
9. Housing stability: Advocate for policies that promote affordable housing options, such as rent control or subsidized housing, to help individuals and families maintain stable living situations.
