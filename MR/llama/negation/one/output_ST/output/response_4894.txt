Creating more inclusive social policies for culturally Hindu very old (90s+) individuals requires a nuanced understanding of their cultural background and specific needs. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for healthcare professionals, caregivers, and social workers to help them understand the cultural beliefs and practices of Hindu seniors. This will enable them to provide appropriate care and support.
2. Respect for Traditional Practices: Recognize and respect the traditional practices and beliefs of Hindu seniors, such as their dietary restrictions, religious rituals, and cultural traditions. This can involve accommodating their wishes regarding these aspects of their care.
3. Involve Family Members: Encourage family members to be involved in the care of their loved ones, particularly during important cultural events and ceremonies. This can help seniors feel more connected to their community and culture.
4. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that facilities are accessible and comfortable for Hindu seniors, including provisions for their religious practices such as puja (worship) and pooja (prayer).
5. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and education to raise awareness about the specific needs of Hindu seniors and how to support them. This can involve collaborating with local Hindu organizations and community leaders.
6. Age-Appropriate Support: Provide age-appropriate support and care for Hindu seniors, taking into account their cultural beliefs and practices. For example, they may need additional support during important life events such as weddings, funerals, or religious festivals.
7. Intergenerational Programs: Develop intergenerational programs that bring together younger and older generations of Hindus to share knowledge, traditions, and cultural practices. This can help build bridges between different age groups within the community.
8. Language Support: Provide language support for Hindu seniors who may not speak the dominant language in their area or who have difficulty communicating due to cognitive decline. This can involve using interpreters or providing translated materials.
9. Accessibility and Inclusive Design: Ensure that facilities are designed to be accessible and inclusive for Hindu seniors
