Temporary visa holders, including ex-spouses, face significant challenges when accessing healthcare services in Australia. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Lack of access to public healthcare services: Temporary visa holders are not eligible for Medicare, which means they cannot access public healthcare services for free or at a reduced cost. This can be a significant burden, especially for those with chronic illnesses or conditions that require ongoing medical attention.
2. Cost of private healthcare: While some temporary visa holders may have private health insurance, many do not. Even for those who do, the cost of private healthcare can be prohibitively expensive, making it difficult to access necessary medical care.
3. Language barriers: For those who are non-English speakers or limited English proficient, navigating the healthcare system can be challenging. They may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, understanding their diagnosis and treatment plans, and accessing interpreters or translators.
4. Difficulty in accessing specialist care: Temporary visa holders may have difficulty accessing specialist care, as they may not have a referral from a general practitioner or may not be able to access specialists who are part of their health insurance network.
5. Limited knowledge of the healthcare system: Many temporary visa holders may not be familiar with the Australian healthcare system and its nuances, which can make it difficult for them to navigate and access necessary care.
6. Difficulty in accessing emergency care: Temporary visa holders may face difficulties accessing emergency care, as they may not have a Medicare card or may not be eligible for emergency department care.
7. Limited access to mental health services: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to mental health services, which can exacerbate any existing mental health issues or make it difficult to seek help during times of crisis.
8. Difficulty in accessing reproductive healthcare: Temporary visa holders may face difficulties accessing reproductive healthcare, including contraception and maternity care, due to their immigration status.
9. Limited access to dental care: Temporary visa holders may have limited access
