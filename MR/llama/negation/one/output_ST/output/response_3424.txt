Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Nigeria's lower-class population are met is a complex and multifaceted challenge. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to healthcare facilities: Many lower-class Nigerians lack access to basic healthcare services due to a lack of healthcare facilities in their areas.
