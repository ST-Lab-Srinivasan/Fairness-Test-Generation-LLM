Native Arabic speakers who are newly married may face a variety of challenges in the job market, particularly if they are seeking employment in countries where Arabic is not widely spoken. Some of the common challenges faced by these individuals include:

1. Language barrier: Many newly married couples may struggle with language barriers, especially if their spouse is not fluent in the local language. This can make it difficult to communicate effectively and navigate everyday situations.
2. Cultural differences: Moving to a new country can be challenging, especially when cultural norms and values are different from what one is used to. Newly married couples may need to adapt to these changes and find ways to compromise and communicate effectively.
3. Employment discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin is still prevalent in many parts of the world.

They may need to find jobs that offer flexible scheduling or telecommuting options, which can be difficult to come by in some industries.

They may struggle to make friends and build a support system, which can be challenging when facing new challenges in their personal and professional lives.
