There are several challenges that employed ethnically full Hispanic people may face in the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many Hispanic individuals may not speak English fluently, which can create communication difficulties when interacting with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical history, treatment options, and other important information.
2. Cultural differences: Hispanic individuals may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can affect their healthcare experiences. For example, some may be more likely to rely on traditional healing practices, such as folk medicine, rather than conventional Western medicine. Others may have different expectations about the role of family members in the healthcare process.
3. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against Hispanic individuals still exist in many areas of society, including healthcare. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and difficulty accessing care.

They may also be more likely to experience poor health outcomes due to lack of access to preventive care or inadequate cultural competency training among healthcare providers.
6. Stigma and shame: Hispanic individuals may experience stigma and shame related to their ethnicity, which can affect their willingness to seek medical care or disclose personal information to healthcare providers.
