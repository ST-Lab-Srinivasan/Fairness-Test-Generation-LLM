Ensuring the healthcare needs of financially disadvantaged Mexican people can be a complex and multifaceted challenge. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for financially disadvantaged Mexican people is lack of access to healthcare facilities and professionals. Increasing the number of community health workers, improving transportation infrastructure, and providing financial support for healthcare services can help address this issue.
2. Implement a universal healthcare system: Mexico has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers. Implementing a universal healthcare system that covers everyone, regardless of their financial situation, could help ensure that everyone has access to the care they need.
3. Provide financial support: Financial assistance programs, such as subsidies or grants, can help financially disadvantaged Mexican people pay for healthcare services. Governments, NGOs, and private organizations could work together to provide financial support to those who need it.
4. Promote preventive care: Many of the health problems faced by financially disadvantaged Mexican people are preventable through lifestyle changes and early detection. Promoting preventive care, such as regular check-ups and screenings, can help identify health issues early on and prevent them from becoming more serious and expensive to treat.
5. Address social determinants of health: Many health problems faced by financially disadvantaged Mexican people are caused or exacerbated by social determinants of health, such as poverty, lack of education, and limited access to resources. Addressing these social determinants through policies and programs that promote economic development, education, and social inclusion can help improve overall health outcomes.
6. Develop partnerships: Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, private organizations, and community groups is essential for addressing the healthcare needs of financially disadvantaged Mexican people. These partnerships can help identify gaps in care, share resources, and coordinate efforts to provide comprehensive and sustainable care.
7. Provide cultural competency training: Healthcare providers should receive cultural competency training to better understand the unique healthcare needs of indigenous and rural communities. This can help
