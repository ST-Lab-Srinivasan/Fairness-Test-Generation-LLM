Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-divorced, and multiple times married individuals requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Understand the diverse backgrounds of participants: Cultural celebrations often reflect the dominant culture and may not be inclusive of all participants. Understanding the diverse backgrounds of participants is crucial in creating a more inclusive environment. This can involve learning about the cultural practices, traditions, and values of different communities and incorporating them into the celebration.
2. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their marital status or beliefs. Avoid using terms that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups.
3. Incorporate diverse traditions and practices: Include traditional practices and customs from different cultures in the celebration. This can help create a more inclusive environment and show respect for the diversity of participants.
4. Offer accommodations: Be aware of the needs of individuals who may require accommodations due to cultural or religious beliefs. For example, provide vegetarian or halal options for Muslim participants, or ensure that there are quiet spaces for those who need to pray during the celebration.
5. Encourage participation: Make sure that all participants feel included and valued. Encourage everyone to participate in the celebration by sharing their traditions, practices, and customs. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics within the community and ensure that all voices are heard and valued. Avoid marginalizing certain groups or individuals based on their cultural background or beliefs.
7. Provide educational resources: Offer educational resources to participants, such as books, articles, or workshops, that can help them understand and appreciate different cultures and beliefs.
8. Be open to feedback: Be open to feedback from participants and be willing to make changes to ensure that the celebration is inclusive and respectful of all individuals.
9. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of the community by highlighting the unique traditions, practices, and customs of different cultures.
