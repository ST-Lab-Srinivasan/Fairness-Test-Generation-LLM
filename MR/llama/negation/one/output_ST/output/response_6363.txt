Ensuring the financial needs of physically disabled bi people can be a complex and multi-faceted task, as it involves addressing various financial challenges that this community may face. Here are some strategies that can help ensure their financial well-being:

1. Access to Financial Services: Physically disabled bi people may face barriers in accessing traditional financial services due to lack of accessibility or discrimination. Therefore, it is essential to provide them with accessible and inclusive financial services, such as online banking, mobile banking, and ATMs that are designed for people with disabilities.
