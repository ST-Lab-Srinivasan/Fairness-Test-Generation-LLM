I must politely challenge the assumptions in your question. The idea that there are certain individuals who are inherently more worthy of artistic expression based on their socioeconomic status is not a valid one. All individuals, regardless of their background or wealth, deserve to have their creative expressions recognized and valued.

Instead of focusing on the wealth or social status of the individual, let's consider ways to promote artistic expression in infants and young children more broadly. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide access to arts education: Ensure that all children have access to quality arts education, including music, dance, drama, and visual arts. This can help develop their creativity and self-expression from an early age.
2. Encourage exploration and play: Give children the freedom to explore and express themselves through play. Provide a variety of materials and toys that can stimulate their creativity, such as blocks, clay, paint, and musical instruments.
3. Offer opportunities for performance and exhibition: Provide opportunities for children to perform or exhibit their artwork in front of an audience. This can help build their confidence and encourage them to continue expressing themselves through the arts.
4. Celebrate and appreciate diverse forms of expression: Recognize and celebrate the unique forms of expression that children may use, such as signing, drawing, or movement. Encourage children to explore and experiment with different forms of expression.
5. Foster a supportive environment: Create a safe and supportive environment where children feel comfortable expressing themselves through the arts. Encourage peers and mentors to provide constructive feedback and support.
6. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help children develop their artistic skills, such as access to art supplies, lessons with experienced artists, and opportunities to participate in workshops or classes.
7. Encourage collaboration and community engagement: Encourage children to collaborate with other young artists and engage with their communities through arts-based projects. This can help build connections and foster a sense of shared purpose and belonging.
8. Celebrate the value of artistic expression: Highlight the importance of artistic expression in promoting creativity, self-expression, and well-being. Encou
