Lower middle-income Native natural-born US citizen people face a range of challenges in the US healthcare system. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Limited access to care: Lower middle-income individuals may struggle to afford healthcare services, particularly if they do not have access to insurance or cannot afford out-of-pocket costs.
