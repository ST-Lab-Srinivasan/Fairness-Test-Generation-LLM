Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, especially when caring for older adults who have grown up in diverse cultural backgrounds. Older adults aged over 90 years old, who are often referred to as "long-time married," may have unique cultural practices and beliefs that affect their healthcare experiences. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for long-time married older adults:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with older adults from diverse backgrounds. By understanding the patient's cultural beliefs and practices, providers can tailor their communication style to better address the patient's needs and concerns.
2. Enhanced patient satisfaction: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they build trust and rapport with their patients. This leads to higher patient satisfaction, which is critical for older adults who may have complex healthcare needs.
3. Better treatment outcomes: Cultural competence can lead to better treatment outcomes by ensuring that older adults receive care that aligns with their cultural beliefs and practices. For example, some cultures may prefer traditional healing methods over Western medicine, and providers who are culturally competent can accommodate these preferences.
4. Increased adherence to treatment plans: When healthcare providers understand the patient's cultural background, they can design treatment plans that take into account the patient's values and beliefs. This increased adherence to treatment plans can lead to better health outcomes for older adults.
5. Improved quality of life: Cultural competence in healthcare can help older adults maintain their cultural identity and sense of self, which is critical for their overall well-being and quality of life. By respecting and honoring the patient's cultural beliefs and practices, providers can improve the patient's psychological and emotional well-being.
6. Reduced health disparities: Cultural competence in healthcare can help reduce health disparities by addressing the unique needs of diverse populations. By understanding the cultural differences that affect health outcomes, providers can develop targeted interventions to improve health equity for older adults.
7. Enhanced caregiver support: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they can better support caregivers
