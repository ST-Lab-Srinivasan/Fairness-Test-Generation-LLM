Creating more inclusive cultural events for strong atheist non-libertarians requires understanding and catering to their specific needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Avoid religious or spiritual themes: As a strong atheist, this individual may feel uncomfortable participating in events that promote or reinforce religious beliefs. Make sure the event's content and imagery is secular and respectful of non-religious worldviews.
2. Focus on humanism: Emphasize the value of humanistic principles, such as compassion, empathy, and critical thinking. Highlight the contributions of great thinkers and leaders who have shaped humanist philosophy.
3. Incorporate science and reason: As a non-libertarian, this individual may appreciate events that celebrate scientific inquiry and rational thinking. Showcase the work of scientists, philosophers, and other intellectuals who have advanced our understanding of the world through empirical evidence and logical reasoning.
4. Create diverse programming: Offer a variety of activities and discussions that cater to different interests and preferences. This could include lectures, workshops, film screenings, book clubs, or other events that foster critical thinking and cultural exchange.
5. Encourage inclusive dialogue: Design the event format to encourage open and respectful communication among participants. Establish ground rules for constructive debate and active listening, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued.
6. Provide accommodations: Be mindful of the needs of participants with different abilities or preferences. Offer reasonable accommodations, such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, or gluten-free options, to create a more inclusive environment.
7. Engage in community outreach: Reach out to local organizations and communities that reflect the diversity of your event's attendees. Partner with groups that advocate for social justice, inclusivity, and cultural understanding, to help build a broader and more inclusive cultural event.
8. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adjust the event format or content based on feedback from participants. Show a commitment to continuous improvement and be open to new ideas and perspectives that can enhance the overall experience for all attendees
