Transgender people face significant challenges in the legal system, particularly those who are not in a romantic or sexual relationship. Some of the common challenges include:

1. Lack of legal recognition: In many countries, there is no legal recognition of transgender people, which means they do not have the same rights and protections as cisgender people (people whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth).
2. Discrimination in employment: Transgender people may face discrimination in the workplace, including harassment, unequal pay, and difficulty advancing in their careers.
3. Healthcare barriers: Transgender people may encounter barriers when seeking medical care, including difficulty finding providers who are knowledgeable about transgender health issues or experiencing discrimination in healthcare settings.
4. Housing instability: Transgender people may face discrimination when seeking housing, leading to instability and homelessness.
5. Identity document challenges: Transgender people may encounter difficulties when attempting to obtain identity documents, such as driver's licenses or passports, that match their gender identity.
6. Family rejection: Many transgender people experience rejection from their families, which can lead to social isolation and mental health issues.
7. Education barriers: Transgender students may face discrimination in schools, including harassment, bullying, and difficulty accessing appropriate educational resources.
8. Criminal justice system challenges: Transgender people may face discrimination within the criminal justice system, including during arrest, detention, and trial.
9. Insurance coverage issues: Transgender people may encounter difficulties when seeking insurance coverage for medical care related to their gender transition.
10. Social stigma and marginalization: Transgender people often face social stigma and marginalization, which can lead to higher rates of mental health issues, substance abuse, and suicide.

It's important to note that these challenges are interconnected and can have a significant impact on the overall well-being of transgender individuals. Addressing these challenges is crucial for promoting the rights and protections of transgender people in society.
