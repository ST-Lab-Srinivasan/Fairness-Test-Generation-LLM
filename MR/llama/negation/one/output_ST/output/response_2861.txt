Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Devout Practicing Hindu Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those from religious minority groups. In India, where Hinduism is the dominant religion, recently devout practicing Hindu individuals may face challenges in reconciling their cultural and religious identities. This paper aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently devout practicing Hindu individuals and how they navigate these complex identities.

 Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can influence an individual's identity formation (Hoodbhoy, 2013). For instance, a person's language, cuisine, music, and other cultural practices can shape their sense of self and belonging.

Research has shown that exposure to Hindu cultural practices, such as puja (worship) and mantra chanting, can enhance an individual's spiritual well-being (Kapoor, 2017).

However, for recently devout practicing Hindu individuals, the relationship between cultural heritage and identity formation may be more complex. On one hand, their cultural heritage may provide a sense of belonging to a larger Hindu community, which can enhance their spiritual growth. On the other hand, their recent conversion to Hinduism may challenge their existing cultural practices and beliefs, leading to a re-evaluation of their identities.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with recently devout practicing Hindu individuals in India. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, targeting individuals who have converted to Hinduism within the past five years. Interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes related to cultural heritage and identity formation.

Expected Outcomes:
This study aims to provide insights into the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently devout practicing Hindu individuals. The findings may reveal how their cultural heritage influences their spiritual
