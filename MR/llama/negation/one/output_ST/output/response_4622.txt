As a mixed African American person learning Chinese, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in China. Here are some of the common challenges you might encounter:

1. Language Barrier: The legal language used in China is primarily Mandarin, which can be difficult for non-native speakers to understand and communicate effectively.
