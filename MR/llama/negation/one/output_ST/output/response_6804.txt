Lower-income temporary visa holders in Australia may face several challenges when accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Limited access to public hospitals: Public hospitals in Australia are generally free or low-cost for permanent residents and citizens, but lower-income temporary visa holders may not have access to these services due to their visa status. They may be required to pay for private health insurance or out-of-pocket expenses, which can be a significant burden.
2. Language barriers: Many lower-income temporary visa holders may face language barriers when trying to navigate the healthcare system. This can make it difficult for them to communicate their symptoms, understand medical advice, or access cultural competency services.
3. Lack of cultural competency: The healthcare system in Australia may not always be culturally sensitive or responsive to the needs of diverse communities, including lower-income temporary visa holders. This can lead to misunderstandings, mistrust, and a lack of engagement with healthcare services.
4. Limited knowledge of healthcare options: Lower-income temporary visa holders may be unfamiliar with the Australian healthcare system and its options, which can make it difficult for them to navigate and access the care they need.
5. Fear of deportation: Some lower-income temporary visa holders may be undocumented or have a pending application for a visa, which can create fear and anxiety when accessing healthcare services. They may hesitate to seek medical attention due to concerns about being reported to immigration authorities or having their visa status affected.
6. Limited financial resources: Lower-income temporary visa holders may have limited financial resources, making it difficult for them to afford healthcare services, prescriptions, or medical equipment.
7. Difficulty in accessing specialist care: Specialist care may not always be readily available or accessible to lower-income temporary visa holders, particularly if they reside outside of major cities. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, exacerbating health problems.
8. Lack of transportation: Lower-income temporary visa holders may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to a lack of transport
