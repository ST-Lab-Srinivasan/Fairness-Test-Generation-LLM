Ensuring that the educational needs of civilian Native natural-born US citizen students are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses historical and systemic barriers to educational success. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers in culturally responsive teaching practices, which involve understanding and valuing the cultural backgrounds of students and incorporating those perspectives into instruction. This can help students feel more engaged and motivated in their learning.
2. Native language immersion programs: Provide opportunities for students to learn their native languages and cultures through immersion programs. This can help students develop a strong sense of identity and cultural pride, which is essential for academic success.
3. Indigenous-focused curriculum: Develop and implement curricula that reflect the histories, cultures, and contributions of Native communities. This can help students see themselves represented in their education and feel more connected to their learning.
4. Community partnerships: Collaborate with Native communities and organizations to provide educational resources and opportunities outside of the classroom. This can include internships, mentorship programs, and cultural events that support student success.
5. Access to technology: Ensure that students have access to technology, including internet access and devices, to support their learning both in and outside of the classroom.
6. Address systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address systemic barriers to educational equity, such as inadequate funding, lack of resources, and discrimination. This can involve advocating for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels.
7. Family engagement: Encourage family engagement in education by providing opportunities for families to learn alongside their students and participate in educational events and activities.
8. Professional development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers and staff to help them better understand the cultural backgrounds of Native students and how to support their academic success.
9. Student leadership: Encourage student leadership and involvement in decision-making processes within the school or district. This can help students feel more invested in their education and more likely to succeed academically.
10. Community-based learning: Incorporate community-based learning opportunities that allow students to learn from and contribute to their communities,
