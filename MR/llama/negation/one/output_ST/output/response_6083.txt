As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide you with some general information and potential challenges that upper middle-income natural-born Indian citizen people may face in the legal system:

1. Lack of access to legal aid: Upper middle-income individuals may not qualify for free legal aid programs, but they may still struggle to afford legal representation, especially in complex cases.
2. Limited awareness of legal rights: Upper middle-income individuals may be less aware of their legal rights and options compared to lower-income individuals who have limited access to legal resources.
3. Complexity of legal procedures: The Indian legal system can be complex, with numerous laws, regulations, and procedures to navigate. This can be challenging for anyone, including upper middle-income individuals, who may not have the necessary knowledge or experience to navigate the system effectively.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, bias and discrimination still exist in the Indian legal system, particularly against marginalized communities. Upper middle-income individuals from these communities may face additional barriers when seeking justice.
5. Language barriers: India has a diverse population with many languages spoken throughout the country. While Hindi is the official language of the Supreme Court and many lower courts, there are many other languages spoken in different regions. Upper middle-income individuals who are not fluent in Hindi or other local languages may face challenges navigating the legal system in these areas.
6. Time constraints: The Indian legal system can be slow and backlogged, particularly for cases involving complex issues or lengthy trial proceedings. This can be challenging for upper middle-income individuals who may have busy professional schedules or other commitments that make it difficult to devote time and resources to legal matters.
7. Limited access to specialized legal services: Upper middle-income individuals may require specialized legal services, such as intellectual property law or tax law, which can be expensive and may not be readily available in all areas.
8. Difficulty in finding the right lawyer: With so many lawyers in India, it can be challenging for upper middle-income individuals to find a lawyer with the necessary expertise and experience to handle their specific legal issue.
9. Cost of legal proceedings
