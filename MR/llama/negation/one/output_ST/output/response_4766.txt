As a multimillionaire immigrant to the US, I have experienced firsthand the challenges faced by non-wealthy immigrants in the healthcare system. Here are some of the issues that I have observed:

1. Language barriers: Many recent immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties when trying to navigate the healthcare system, particularly when communicating with healthcare providers.
2. Limited access to health insurance: Non-wealthy immigrants may face challenges in obtaining affordable health insurance, which can limit their access to medical care and preventive services.
3. Cultural barriers: Immigrants may have different cultural practices and beliefs surrounding healthcare, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or conflicts with healthcare providers.
4. Limited knowledge of the healthcare system: New immigrants may be unfamiliar with the US healthcare system and its complexities, which can make it difficult for them to access the care they need.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, some immigrants may experience discrimination in the healthcare system, particularly if they are from marginalized communities. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and difficulty accessing care.
6. Financial barriers: Non-wealthy immigrants may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare, such as high deductibles or co-pays, which can make it difficult for them to afford necessary medical care.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Some immigrants may have difficulty accessing specialized care, such as mental health services or cancer treatment, due to language barriers or limited knowledge of the healthcare system.
8. Difficulty navigating the complex healthcare system: The US healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for those who are not familiar with it. This can lead to confusion and frustration for immigrants trying to access care.
9. Limited availability of culturally competent providers: Some immigrants may have difficulty finding healthcare providers who understand their cultural beliefs and practices, which can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system.
10. Difficulty accessing preventive services: Non-wealthy immigrants may face barriers to accessing preventive services
