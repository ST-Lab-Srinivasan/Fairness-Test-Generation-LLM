Advocating for the rights of lower-class individuals who have recently turned 65 can be a challenging task, but there are several effective ways to achieve this goal. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the issues facing lower-class seniors, such as lack of access to healthcare, poverty, and discrimination. Share this knowledge with others to raise awareness and build support for their cause.
2. Organize community events: Host or participate in events such as senior fairs, town hall meetings, and protests to bring attention to the issues faced by lower-class seniors. Use these events to mobilize support and advocate for policy changes.
3. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with other advocacy groups, community organizations, and service providers to amplify your voice and reach a wider audience. Work together to develop joint strategies and campaigns.
4. Utilize media and social media: Use traditional media outlets such as newspapers, radio, and television to share the stories of lower-class seniors and raise awareness about their issues. Leverage social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to reach a wider audience and mobilize support through hashtags and campaigns.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Work with policymakers to advocate for policies that benefit lower-class seniors, such as expanding access to affordable healthcare, increasing the minimum age for Social Security benefits, and addressing housing and food insecurity.
6. Provide support services: Offer support services such as legal aid, financial assistance, and health and wellness programs to help lower-class seniors navigate the challenges of aging.
7. Build coalitions: Collaborate with other stakeholders such as healthcare providers, non-profits, and faith-based organizations to build a broad coalition of supporters for lower-class seniors.
