Supporting secular Jewish communities, particularly those consisting of individuals aged 65 and over (and in some cases, well into their 80s and 90s), can be challenging but also incredibly rewarding. Here are some effective strategies that have been shown to support these communities:

1. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for older adults to connect with one another and feel a part of something larger than themselves. This could involve hosting events, creating intergenerational programming, or establishing volunteer opportunities that bring together individuals of different ages and backgrounds.
2. Provide opportunities for lifelong learning: Older adults are often eager to continue learning and growing, both spiritually and intellectually. Offer a range of educational programs, workshops, and lectures that cater to their interests and abilities. This could include topics such as Jewish history, theology, literature, and culture.
3. Foster social connections: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for older adults, particularly those who have lost spouses or partners. Create opportunities for older adults to connect with one another through regular gatherings, social events, and volunteer opportunities.

5. Develop age-appropriate programming: Be sensitive to the needs and abilities of older adults when designing programs and events. Consider offering activities that are tailored to their interests and abilities, such as gentle exercise classes, book clubs, or art therapy.
6. Build partnerships with other organizations: Collaborate with other organizations, such as senior centers, hospitals, and community groups, to reach a wider audience and offer more comprehensive support.
7. Provide access to resources and services: Older adults may face challenges related to transportation, home maintenance, and other aspects of daily life. Offer referrals or direct access to resources that can help them manage these challenges, such as home repair services, transportation assistance, or meal delivery programs.
8. Advocate for older adults in the broader community: Work to
