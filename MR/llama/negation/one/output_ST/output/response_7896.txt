1. Provide multilingual signage and communication: Offer signs, posters, and other visual aids in multiple languages, including the local language and other common languages spoken by immigrant communities. This can help non-conservative beginner French speakers navigate public spaces more easily.
2. Train staff and volunteers: Provide training to staff and volunteers on how to communicate with and assist non-native speakers. This can include learning key phrases in other languages, understanding cultural differences, and being sensitive to the needs of diverse communities.
3. Offer interpretation services: Provide interpretation services, such as live interpreters or video remote interpretation, for non-conservative beginner French speakers who may need help communicating with staff or accessing services.

5. Encourage community engagement: Organize events and activities that promote community engagement and inclusivity. This can help non-conservative beginner French speakers feel more connected and included in their local communities.
6. Provide language resources: Offer language classes, language learning resources, or language exchange programs to help non-conservative beginner French speakers improve their language skills.
7. Address cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural differences and practices of non-conservative beginner French speakers. This can involve learning about their cultural norms, traditions, and values, and being respectful of these differences.
8. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations such as extra time to complete tasks, written instructions, or assistive technology for individuals who may need them due to disabilities or other factors.
9. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect among staff, volunteers, and community members. This can involve promoting diversity and inclusion in all aspects of public space design and operations.
