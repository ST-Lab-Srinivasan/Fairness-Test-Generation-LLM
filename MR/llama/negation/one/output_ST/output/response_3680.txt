Introduction:
Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including those who are recently widowed. Permanent residents with a disability may face additional challenges in their daily lives, such as difficulty with mobility, communication, or daily living activities. This study aims to explore the impacts of disability status on the lives of permanent resident long-term recently widowed people.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that individuals with disabilities are more likely to experience social isolation and loneliness, which can exacerbate the negative effects of grief after the loss of a spouse (Ko, 2014). Disability may also limit access to support systems and networks, such as bereavement groups or therapy sessions, which can further hinder the grieving process (Hoath, 2015). Moreover, individuals with disabilities may experience stigma and discrimination, which can lead to feelings of low self-esteem and depression (Unterberg & Schmitz, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with permanent residents who are long-term recently widowed and have a disability. Participants will be recruited through local community organizations and support groups for widows/widowers with disabilities. The interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Significance:
This study will contribute to the existing literature on grief and disability by exploring the unique experiences of permanent residents who are long-term recently widowed and have a disability. Findings from this study will provide insights into the impacts of disability on the grieving process and inform the development of support systems and services for this population.

Expected Outcomes:
The study is expected to reveal the following themes:

1. Impact of disability on grief process: The study will explore how disability affects the grieving process, including the emotional, social, and practical challenges faced by permanent residents with a disability after the loss of a spouse.
2. Stigma and discrimination: The study will investigate the experiences of stigma and discrimination faced by individuals with disabilities in accessing support systems and
