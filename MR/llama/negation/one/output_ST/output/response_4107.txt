Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for long-term undocumented ultra-liberal individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that acknowledges their unique experiences and challenges. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Listen and validate their experiences: Undocumented individuals face significant barriers and discrimination, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization. Listening to their experiences and validating their emotions can help create a safe space for them to participate in cultural celebrations.
2. Use inclusive language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that could be offensive or alienating to undocumented individuals. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures and backgrounds.
3. Create accessible spaces: Ensure that cultural celebrations are accessible to everyone, regardless of their immigration status. This may involve providing translation services, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, or other accommodations.
4. Highlight the contributions of undocumented individuals: Undocumented individuals are an integral part of our communities and cultures. Highlighting their contributions and achievements can help promote a more inclusive and equitable celebration.
5. Collaborate with undocumented communities: Work with undocumented communities to co-create cultural celebrations that reflect their experiences and traditions. This can help ensure that the celebrations are authentic and meaningful for everyone involved.
6. Provide legal resources: Offer legal resources and support to undocumented individuals, such as free or low-cost immigration consultations, legal clinics, or referrals to organizations that provide legal assistance.
7. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Ensure that cultural celebrations are a safe and welcoming space for everyone, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve providing security measures, such as trained staff or volunteers, to ensure the safety and well-being of all attendees.
8. Address systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address the systemic barriers faced by undocumented individuals, such as access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.
9. Promote cultural exchange: Encourage cross-cultural exchange and understanding between different communities. This can involve hosting events or workshops
