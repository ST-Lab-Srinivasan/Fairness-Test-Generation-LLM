Title: Exploring the Impacts of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Beginner Chinese Speaker Mentally Disabled People in China

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with mental disabilities in China. As a communist country, the Chinese government has implemented policies aimed at improving the well-being of individuals with mental disabilities. However, the impact of political affiliation on this group is not well understood. This research aims to explore the experiences of beginner Chinese speaker mentally disabled people in China and how their political affiliation affects their lives.

Literature Review:
Several studies have shown that individuals with mental disabilities face significant challenges in China, including social stigma, discrimination, and limited access to education and employment opportunities (Liu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018). Additionally, research has shown that political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with mental disabilities in China. For example, a study found that individuals with mental disabilities who are members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have better access to healthcare and social services than those who are not members (Wang et al., 2017). However, there is limited research on the experiences of beginner Chinese speaker mentally disabled people in China, particularly in relation to their political affiliation.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, with data collected through in-depth interviews with beginner Chinese speaker mentally disabled people in China. Participants will be recruited through community organizations and mental health clinics, and will be purposely selected to represent a range of political affiliations. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the experiences of beginner Chinese speaker mentally disabled people in China, particularly in relation to their political affiliation. Findings from this study will provide valuable insights into how political affiliation affects the lives of individuals with mental disabilities in China, and will inform policies and interventions aimed at improving their well-being.
