4. Encourage them to use Chinese in their daily life: Encourage them to use Chinese in their daily life by creating opportunities for them to interact with native speakers, either in person or online. This could include joining a language exchange program, participating in online language learning communities, or using language learning apps that connect them with native speakers.
