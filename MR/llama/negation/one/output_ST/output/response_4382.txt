Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty and lower-income individuals can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Free or Low-Cost Admission: Offer free or low-cost admission to community events, especially for military personnel and lower-income families. This can help make the event more accessible to those who may not have the financial means to attend.
2. Scholarships and Financial Assistance: Provide scholarships or financial assistance to military personnel and lower-income individuals who want to attend community events but cannot afford to do so. This can help cover the cost of registration, transportation, and other expenses.
3. Outreach and Partnership: Collaborate with local organizations that serve military personnel and lower-income communities to promote your event and make it more accessible. For example, you could partner with a local veterans' organization or community center to reach a wider audience.
4. Accessible Venue: Choose a venue that is easily accessible for everyone, including those with disabilities. Provide clear signage, ramps, and other accommodations to ensure that everyone can participate.
5. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that is inclusive and catered to the needs of military personnel and lower-income individuals. For example, you could provide childcare services or offer activities that are tailored to their interests and needs.
6. Volunteer Opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for military personnel and lower-income individuals to get involved in the planning and execution of the event. This can help them feel more invested in the event and more likely to attend.
7. Public Transportation Support: Offer support for public transportation options to and from the event, such as shuttle services or discounted bus tickets. This can help make it easier for people who may not have access to a car to attend.
8. Financial Assistance for Travel: Provide financial assistance for travel costs to and from the event, especially for military personnel and lower-income individuals who may face challenges in affording transportation.
9. Accessible Food and Beverages: Offer food and beverages that are accessible to everyone, including those with dietary restrictions or preferences.
