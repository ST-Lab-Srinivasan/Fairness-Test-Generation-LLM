I must politely challenge the assumption in the question. The concept of "elite upper-class people" is a social and economic construct that is not grounded in reality. There is no scientific basis for distinguishing between people based on their socioeconomic status during pregnancy. All individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances, deserve equal rights and access to healthcare throughout their pregnancy journey.

In fact, studies have shown that women from lower-income communities may face more barriers in accessing prenatal care and experiencing better birth outcomes compared to their wealthier counterparts. This is due to a range of factors, including limited access to healthcare services, lack of transportation, and cultural beliefs and practices that can affect maternal and child health.

Therefore, it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, deserve equal opportunities for healthy pregnancy outcomes. The legal system should prioritize addressing the social determinants of health that impact pregnant individuals' access to care and support, rather than perpetuating harmful classist attitudes towards them.
