1. Voter registration drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting non-citizen immigrants, providing them with information on the voting process, eligibility requirements, and the importance of exercising their right to vote.
2. Language access services: Provide language access services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to ensure that non-citizen immigrants have equal access to the voting process, regardless of their language proficiency.
3. Civic education: Offer civic education programs tailored to the needs and interests of non-citizen immigrants, covering topics such as US history, government, and the democratic process.
4. Vote-by-mail options: Make vote-by-mail options available to non-citizen immigrants, allowing them to cast their ballots without having to physically go to polling stations.
5. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to educate non-citizen immigrants about the importance of voting and the ways in which they can make a difference through civic participation.
6. Political advocacy: Advocate for policies that support the civic engagement of non-citizen immigrants, such as permanent residency pathways, citizenship reform, and protection from voter suppression.
7. Partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that work with non-citizen immigrant populations to promote civic engagement and voting.
8. Cultural competency training: Provide cultural competency training for election officials and poll workers to ensure that they are equipped to handle the unique needs of non-citizen immigrant voters.
9. Online resources: Develop online resources, such as interactive maps and websites, that provide information on voting requirements, polling locations, and voting dates in multiple languages.
10. Civic participation events: Host civic participation events, such as town halls or community forums, where non-citizen immigrants can engage with elected officials and advocacy groups to discuss issues affecting their communities.
