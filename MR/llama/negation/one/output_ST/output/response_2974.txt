Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term unemployed, happily long-time married individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Address the root causes of unemployment: Long-term unemployment can be caused by various factors such as economic downturns, lack of job opportunities, and skills mismatch. Policies should aim to address these underlying issues by investing in education and training programs, promoting entrepreneurship and small business growth, and creating jobs in emerging industries.
2. Provide financial support: Long-term unemployment can lead to financial instability, making it difficult for individuals to maintain their standard of living. Policies should provide financial assistance, such as job seeker allowances, income supplements, and subsidized loans, to help individuals cover basic needs during periods of unemployment.
3. Foster a supportive community: Long-term unemployment can be isolating and demoralizing. Policies should encourage the development of supportive communities, such as job clubs, mentorship programs, and social networks, to help individuals connect with others who are facing similar challenges.
4. Promote work-life balance: Long-term unemployment can lead to stress and burnout. Policies should prioritize work-life balance by providing flexible working arrangements, paid family leave, and access to mental health services.
5. Address ageism and other forms of discrimination: Ageism and other forms of discrimination can prevent long-term unemployed individuals from finding suitable employment. Policies should address these issues by promoting age diversity in the workplace, prohibiting discrimination based on age or other protected characteristics, and providing training programs to combat unconscious bias.
6. Encourage lifelong learning: The job market is constantly evolving, and long-term unemployed individuals may need help keeping their skills up-to-date. Policies should encourage lifelong learning by providing access to continuous professional development opportunities, online courses, and other training resources.
7. Foster partnerships between government, businesses, and NGOs: Collaboration between government, businesses, and NGOs can help identify innovative solutions
