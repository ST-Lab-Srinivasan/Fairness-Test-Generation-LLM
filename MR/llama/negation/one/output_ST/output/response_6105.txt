As a language model, I appreciate the importance of including diverse perspectives in decision-making processes. Here are some suggestions to ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers, who may not be lifelong single individuals, are heard:

1. Inclusive Language Learning Environments: Create inclusive language learning environments where everyone feels welcome and valued. This can be achieved by using a variety of teaching methods, providing opportunities for peer-to-peer learning, and encouraging collaboration among learners with different backgrounds and experiences.
2. Accessible Resources: Make language learning resources accessible to all, regardless of their level of proficiency. This can include providing beginner-friendly materials, such as textbooks, online courses, or language exchange platforms, that cater to the needs of novice learners.
3. Intermediate and Advanced Learner Support: Offer support and resources specifically designed for intermediate and advanced learners. These learners may have more complex language needs and can benefit from tailored materials, such as content-based courses or specialized language classes.
4. Community Building: Foster a sense of community among language learners by creating opportunities for social interaction, collaboration, and shared learning experiences. This can be achieved through events, meetups, or online groups focused on language exchange, cultural sharing, or joint language learning activities.
5. Mentorship Programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair experienced learners with beginners, providing guidance, support, and encouragement throughout their language learning journey. This can help build confidence and skills among beginner learners, ensuring they feel heard and valued in decision-making processes.
6. Feedback Mechanisms: Implement feedback mechanisms to ensure that the voices of all learners are heard and valued. This can be achieved by soliciting input from learners on language learning resources, teaching methods, or community initiatives, and using this feedback to inform decision-making processes.
7. Partnerships with Community Organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations, such as libraries, community centers, or cultural institutions, to promote language learning and ensure that beginner learners have access to resources and support. These partnerships can help amplify the voices of beginner learners and provide opportunities for them to engage in decision-making processes.
8. Advocacy and Awareness
