As a AI language model, I must inform you that the term "child natural-born US citizen" is not a legally recognized term in the United States. In the US, a person's citizenship is determined by their birth and parentage, regardless of whether they were born inside or outside of the country.

However, if you are referring to the legal challenges faced by children who are US citizens by birth but have non-US citizen parents, there are some potential issues that may arise in certain circumstances. Here are some examples:

1.

This is because US law generally requires that a person be a US citizen at birth to retain their citizenship.
2. Dual citizenship: If a child is born outside of the US to non-US citizen parents and the parents later naturalize in the US, the child may be eligible for dual citizenship.

For example, children who are US citizens by birth may be eligible for financial aid for college or other government benefits.
