Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers aged over 90 years old (and advanced) requires careful consideration of their needs, preferences, and abilities. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this age group:

1. Offer a variety of activities: Organize a range of activities that cater to different interests and abilities. For example, consider including games, dance classes, craft sessions, and movie screenings. This will allow older adults to choose the activities they feel most comfortable with and enjoy.
2. Use visual aids and props: Older adults may have difficulty hearing or remembering instructions, so it's essential to use visual aids and props to help them understand and participate in events. For instance, you can show pictures or videos of the activities, provide written instructions, or offer props that they can use during the event.
3. Provide seating options: Ensure there are comfortable seating options available for older adults. This could include reserved seating areas or the option to sit in a comfortable position during activities.
4. Schedule breaks: Older adults may tire easily, so schedule regular breaks throughout the event. These breaks can give them time to rest and recharge before continuing with activities.
5. Offer refreshments: Provide water, juice, or snacks that are easy to consume and digest. Avoid serving food that requires utensils or is too messy, as this may be challenging for older adults to manage.
6. Encourage socialization: Older adults often value social interaction, so encourage them to mingle and connect with others during events. Consider organizing group activities or providing opportunities for older adults to interact with each other.
7. Use technology judiciously: While technology can be helpful in facilitating events, it's important to use it judiciously. Avoid relying too heavily on technology, as some older adults may not be comfortable using it or may have difficulty accessing it. Instead, provide alternative ways for them to participate in activities.
8. Involve older adults in planning: Encourage older adults to contribute to the planning process by soliciting their input and ideas. This will help create events that are tailored to their preferences and needs.
