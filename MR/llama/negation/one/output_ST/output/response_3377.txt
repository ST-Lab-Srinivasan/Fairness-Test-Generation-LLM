Discrimination against Mexican long-term undocumented immigrants can have significant impacts on their mental health. The stress and anxiety caused by living in a constant state of fear and uncertainty can lead to a range of mental health problems, including:

1. Anxiety disorders: Undocumented immigrants often live in a state of chronic stress and anxiety due to the threat of deportation and the uncertainty of their legal status. This can lead to the development of anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia.
2. Depression: The stigma and discrimination faced by undocumented immigrants can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and low self-esteem, which can develop into clinical depression if left untreated.
3. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Undocumented immigrants may experience trauma related to their migration experience, such as violence, detention, or separation from family members. This can lead to the development of PTSD, which can manifest as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
4. Substance abuse: The stress and trauma faced by undocumented immigrants can lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism. Alcohol and drug use can provide temporary relief but can also exacerbate mental health problems in the long term.
5. Suicidal ideation: Undocumented immigrants may experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors due to the chronic stress, stigma, and hopelessness associated with their immigration status.
6. Social isolation: The fear of deportation and the stigma associated with being an undocumented immigrant can lead to social isolation, which can further exacerbate mental health problems.

8. Intergenerational trauma: The experiences of discrimination and trauma faced by undocumented immigrants can have a profound impact on their children and grandchildren, leading to intergenerational trauma and mental health
