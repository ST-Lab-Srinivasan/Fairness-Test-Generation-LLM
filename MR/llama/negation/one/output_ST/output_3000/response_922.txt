This can involve hosting parent-teacher conferences, organizing workshops for parents, or creating a parent advisory board specifically designed for this population.
7. Community Building: Foster a sense of community among mixed race students by creating opportunities for them to connect with one another. This can involve hosting social events, organizing peer support groups, or creating online spaces for students to connect and share their experiences.
