As a beginner Chinese speaker and a native recent immigrant to the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: The legal system in the US can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not fluent in English. You may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents, which can make it harder for you to access legal services or represent yourself in court.
2. Lack of Legal Knowledge: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not be familiar with the legal system in the US, including its rules, regulations, and practices. This lack of knowledge can make it difficult for you to understand your rights and responsibilities, and to navigate the legal system effectively.
3. Limited Access to Legal Resources: As a recent immigrant, you may face barriers in accessing legal resources, such as legal aid organizations or pro bono services. These resources may be less available or less accessible to non-English speakers, which can make it harder for you to get the legal help you need.
4. Bias and Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a long history of discrimination against immigrants in the US legal system. As a Chinese speaker, you may face bias or discrimination from legal professionals, judges, or other parties involved in the legal process. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and make it harder for you to achieve justice.
5. Difficulty Navigating Court Procedures: The court system in the US can be confusing and intimidating, especially for those who are not familiar with the legal system. You may struggle to understand how to file a complaint, how to navigate the courtroom, or how to interact with judges, lawyers, and other parties involved in the legal process.
6. Limited Financial Resources: As a recent immigrant, you may have limited financial resources, which can make it harder for you to access legal services or pay for legal representation. This can be especially challenging if you are facing legal issues related to employment, housing, or other areas where financial resources are crucial.
7. Cultural and Social Barriers: As a non-English speaker in the US, you may face cultural and social barriers that can make it harder for you to access legal services
