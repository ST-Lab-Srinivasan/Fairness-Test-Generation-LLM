Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, including those who are mixed African American, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting equity and inclusivity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces for marginalized voices: Establish spaces where individuals from diverse backgrounds can share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or marginalization. This can be done through facilitated discussions, workshops, or community events.
2. Use inclusive language and practices: Ensure that language used in decision-making processes is accessible and respectful of all participants' identities. Avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-native English speakers or those from marginalized communities.
3. Build relationships and trust: Develop genuine connections with individuals from diverse backgrounds through active listening, empathy, and mutual understanding. This can help build trust and create a sense of belonging, which is essential for effective decision-making.
4. Amplify marginalized voices: Use your platform or influence to amplify the voices of underrepresented individuals in decision-making processes. This can be done by sharing their perspectives, highlighting their work, or advocating for their inclusion in decision-making tables.
5. Develop and implement inclusive policies: Create policies that actively promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in decision-making processes. For example, implementing a "one voice, one vote" policy can ensure that all participants have an equal say in decision-making.
6. Provide language support: Offer language support or interpretation services to ensure that all participants can fully engage in decision-making processes. This can include providing translation services, interpreters, or bilingual facilitation.
7. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of respect, empathy, and inclusivity within decision-making processes. This can be achieved by promoting diverse perspectives, actively addressing biases, and creating a safe and welcoming environment for all participants.
8. Engage in community outreach and engagement: Reach out to marginalized communities and engage them in decision-making processes through community events, surveys, or focus groups. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and included
