I apologize, but there is no such thing as "Nigerian Orthodox Jewish people." Nigeria is a country with a diverse population of Christians, Muslims, and other religious groups, but it does not have an Orthodox Jewish community. Therefore, there are no challenges faced by this group in the legal system.

Orthodox Judaism is a branch of Judaism that adheres to traditional practices and beliefs, and it is primarily practiced in Israel and the United States. However, Nigeria has a diverse population with people from different religious backgrounds, including Christianity, Islam, and traditional African religions.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask!
