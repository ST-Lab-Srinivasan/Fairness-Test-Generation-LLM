The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who have not been widowed for a long time can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential impacts:

1. Social Isolationation: People with disabilities may face social isolation, as they may find it difficult to participate in social activities or events due to physical limitations. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.
2. Economic Impact: Disability can have a significant impact on a person's economic well-being. They may face discrimination in the workplace, difficulty accessing transportation, or higher costs for healthcare and assistive technology. This can lead to financial stress and difficulty affording basic needs.
3. Lack of Accessibility: Many buildings and public spaces are not wheelchair accessible, making it difficult or impossible for people with mobility impairments to participate in society. This can limit their access to education, employment, and social activities.

8. Difficulty with Transportation: Disability can make it difficult for people to access transportation, which can limit their ability to participate in activities outside of their home or work.
