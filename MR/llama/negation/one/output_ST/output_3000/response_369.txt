Mexican casual Buddhists may face several challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Lack of recognition: Buddhism is not an officially recognized religion in Mexico, which can make it difficult for Buddhists to access legal protections and benefits.
2. Limited awareness: Many judges, lawyers, and other legal professionals may be unfamiliar with the principles and practices of Buddhism, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations in legal proceedings.
3. Cultural insensitivity: The legal system may not always take into account the cultural and spiritual beliefs of Buddhists, which can result in practices and rituals being ignored or discriminated against.
4. Discrimination: Buddhists in Mexico may face discrimination based on their religious beliefs, particularly if they are perceived as being "foreign" or "different."
5. Limited access to legal resources: Buddhists in Mexico may have limited access to legal resources and support, such as legal aid organizations or advocacy groups, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
6. Difficulty in proving religious discrimination: It can be challenging for Buddhists to prove that they have faced discrimination based on their religion, particularly if the discrimination is subtle or indirect.
7. Limited protections under labor laws: Buddhist workers may face challenges in asserting their rights under labor laws, particularly if they are not recognized as a legitimate religious group.
8. Difficulty in accessing benefits: Buddhists may face difficulties in accessing benefits such as social security or pension plans, which can be based on religious affiliation.
9. Limited access to education and training: Buddhists may have limited access to educational and training opportunities, particularly if they are not recognized as a legitimate religious group.
10. Stigma and discrimination: Buddhists in Mexico may face stigma and discrimination based on their religion, which can affect their ability to access legal protections and benefits.

It's worth noting that these challenges may vary depending on the specific context and location within Mexico. However, these are some of the common challenges faced by Mexican casual Buddhists in the legal system.
