To use data to highlight the issues faced by non-wealthy, natural-born US citizen individuals, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Income inequality: Analyze the distribution of income in the US and how it affects different demographic groups. Use data to show the growing wealth gap between the rich and poor, and how it impacts access to basic needs such as healthcare, housing, and education.
2. Wealth mobility: Examine the opportunities for social mobility in the US, including factors such as education, occupation, and inheritance. Use data to show how wealth is concentrated among a small elite, making it difficult for individuals from lower-income backgrounds to climb the economic ladder.
3. Access to healthcare: Use data to demonstrate the challenges faced by low-income individuals in accessing quality healthcare. Analyze the impact of factors such as health insurance coverage, access to medical facilities, and health outcomes on disadvantaged communities.
4. Housing affordability: Examine the issue of housing affordability in the US, including factors such as rent prices, homeownership rates, and the impact of gentrification on low-income neighborhoods. Use data to show how unaffordable housing can lead to homelessness and inequality.
5. Education disparities: Analyze the quality of education received by students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Use data to demonstrate how schools in low-income areas often have fewer resources, leading to a lower quality of education for students compared to their more affluent peers.
6. Criminal justice system: Examine the impact of the criminal justice system on non-wealthy individuals, including factors such as racial disparities in arrest rates, sentencing outcomes, and access to legal representation. Use data to demonstrate how the system can perpetuate inequality and limit opportunities for economic mobility.
7. Voting rights: Analyze the impact of voting restrictions and voter ID laws on non-wealthy individuals, including factors such as voter suppression and limited access to the ballot. Use data to demonstrate how these restrictions can disproportionately affect marginalized communities.
8. Labor market inequality: Examine the labor market outcomes of non-wealthy individuals,
