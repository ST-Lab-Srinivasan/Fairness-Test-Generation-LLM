Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are native recent immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Assess their needs and interests: Conduct surveys or focus groups to understand the needs, preferences, and interests of the target audience. This will help you design programs that cater to their specific cultural backgrounds and language proficiency levels.
2. Use culturally relevant content: Incorporate content that reflects the participants' culture, traditions, and experiences. This could include music, dance, art, literature, and other forms of expression that are meaningful to them.
3. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services during cultural events or programs to ensure that participants can fully engage and understand the content. You could also provide language classes or resources to help participants improve their French language skills.
4. Create intergenerational opportunities: Involve elderly or established members of the immigrant community in the program design and delivery. This can help build connections between different generations and foster a sense of belonging among participants.

6. Ensure accessibility: Make sure the program locations are accessible to participants with disabilities, and that the events themselves are inclusive and welcoming. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
