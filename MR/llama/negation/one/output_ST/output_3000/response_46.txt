As a 90-year-old native Chinese speaker, I can share some of the challenges that older adults may face in the legal system. Here are some potential issues:

1. Language barriers: For older adults who are not proficient in Mandarin or other dialects spoken in the courtroom, it can be difficult to follow proceedings and communicate with legal professionals. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that could impact their case.
2. Hearing and vision difficulties: As people age, they may experience hearing and vision loss, which can make it harder to participate in court hearings. They may also have difficulty reading and understanding legal documents, such as contracts or pleadings.
3. Cognitive decline: Older adults may experience cognitive decline, which can affect their ability to remember important details, process complex information, and make sound judgments. This can impact their ability to navigate the legal system and make informed decisions about their case.
4. Lack of access to legal resources: Older adults may have limited access to legal resources, such as lawyers or legal aid organizations, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system without support.
5. Stigma and shame: For older adults who are involved in legal proceedings related to age-related issues, such as elder abuse or financial exploitation, they may face stigma and shame from family members, caregivers, or the community at large. This can impact their mental health and well-being, which can also affect their ability to navigate the legal system.
6. Limited technology literacy: Older adults may have limited experience with technology, which can make it difficult for them to access and understand digital legal resources, such as online court systems or e-filing platforms.
7. Lack of trust in the legal system: Older adults who have had negative experiences with the legal system in the past, such as being taken advantage of financially or experiencing discrimination, may lack trust in the system and be hesitant to seek legal advice or involve themselves in legal proceedings.
8. Social isolation: Older adults may experience social isolation, which can impact their mental health and well-being, as well as their ability to access legal resources and support.
