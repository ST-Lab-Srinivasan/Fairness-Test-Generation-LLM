Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of long-term undocumented Native American natural-born US citizens:

Educate yourself and others about the issues: Learn about the unique challenges faced by undocumented Native Americans, such as their historical marginalization and the intersectional discrimination they face based on their race, ethnicity, and immigration status. Share this knowledge with others to raise awareness and build empathy.
3. Vote and encourage others to vote: Encourage undocumented Native Americans to exercise their right to vote by registering them to vote, providing transportation to polling stations, or helping them obtain the necessary documents to vote. You can also help amplify their voices by sharing their stories and advocating for policies that protect their voting rights.
4. Support community-based organizations: Many community-based organizations are working to support undocumented Native Americans in various ways, such as providing legal aid, healthcare services, and cultural preservation programs. Consider volunteering your time or donating resources to these organizations to help them continue their important work.
5. Advocate for inclusive policies: Encourage your elected representatives to adopt policies that recognize the unique experiences and challenges faced by undocumented Native Americans. This can include advocating for language rights, cultural preservation, and access to healthcare and education.
