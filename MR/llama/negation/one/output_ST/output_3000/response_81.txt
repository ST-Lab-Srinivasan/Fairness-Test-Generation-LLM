Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Beginner Chinese Speaker Mentally Able-Bodied People

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Chinese speaker mentally able-bodied people. In China, the political climate is heavily influenced by the Communist Party, and individuals who identify as non-Party members or hold dissenting views may face discrimination and marginalization. This study aims to explore the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Chinese speaker mentally able-bodied people in China.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with 20 beginner Chinese speaker mentally able-bodied people in China. Participants will be recruited through purposive sampling, and will be selected based on their political affiliation (Party member or non-Party member). The interview questions will be designed to explore the participants' experiences of discrimination, marginalization, and stigma based on their political affiliation.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that political affiliation has a significant impact on the lives of beginner Chinese speaker mentally able-bodied people in China. Party members reported experiencing less discrimination and marginalization than non-Party members, who faced significant barriers to employment, education, and social integration. Non-Party members also reported feeling stigmatized and excluded from society due to their political beliefs.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the significant impact that political affiliation can have on the lives of beginner Chinese speaker mentally able-bodied people in China.

Recommendations:
Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that policies be implemented to address the marginalization and stigma faced by non-Part
