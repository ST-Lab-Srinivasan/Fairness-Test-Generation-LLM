Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Term Widowed Beginner Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who have experienced significant life changes such as widowhood. This study aims to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of long-term widowed beginner Spanish speakers. By examining how cultural heritage influences their language learning and cultural integration, this research will provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between identity, culture, and language acquisition.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can significantly shape an individual's identity, particularly during times of change or transition (Koh & Riley, 2017). Widowhood is a significant life change that can impact an individual's sense of self and belonging (Lambert, 2013). For long-term widowed beginner Spanish speakers, the process of learning a new language and adapting to a new cultural context can be particularly challenging.

Cultural heritage can influence language learning in several ways. Firstly, it can affect an individual's motivation to learn a new language, as their cultural identity and values may conflict with those of the target culture (Komaki & Shah, 2015). Secondly, cultural heritage can impact an individual's cognitive abilities and learning style, which can affect their ability to acquire a new language (Ellis, 2008). Finally, cultural heritage can shape the way individuals interact with others in their social environment, influencing their communication behaviors and language use (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from long-term widowed beginner Spanish speakers. Participants will be recruited through local community centers and online language learning groups. Interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
The findings of this study reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-term widowed beginner Spanish speakers.
