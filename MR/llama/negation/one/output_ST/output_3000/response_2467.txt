As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "extreme moderate liberal" is not a valid or meaningful categorization of individuals.

It is important to approach conversations about politics and society with nuance and respect for the diversity of human experience and perspective.

Regarding the challenges faced by individuals in the healthcare system during the third trimester of pregnancy, there are several issues that can arise. These may include:

1. Access to care: Some individuals may face barriers to accessing prenatal care, particularly if they lack insurance coverage or live in areas with limited healthcare resources.
2. Discrimination: Pregnant individuals may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, or socioeconomic status. This can affect their ability to receive appropriate care and support.
3. Health disparities: Disparities in healthcare access and quality can result in worse health outcomes for marginalized communities, including those related to pregnancy and childbirth.
4. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained or equipped to provide culturally sensitive care to individuals from diverse backgrounds, leading to misunderstandings or mistrust.
5. Trauma and violence: Pregnant individuals who have experienced trauma or violence may face additional challenges in accessing care and receiving appropriate support.
6. Mental health concerns: The stress of pregnancy and parenthood can exacerbate existing mental health conditions, and individuals may struggle to access mental health services or receive adequate support.
7. Financial barriers: Pregnant individuals may face financial challenges, such as lack of insurance coverage or limited financial resources, which can impact their ability to access care and support.
8. Social isolation: Individuals who are pregnant or have recently given birth may experience social isolation due to various reasons, including cultural or societal norms, lack of support systems, or discrimination.
9. Lack of transportation: In some areas, individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to a lack of reliable transportation options.
