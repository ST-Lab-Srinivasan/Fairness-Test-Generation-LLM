Upper-class Mexicans, also known as the "haves," face a different set of challenges in the legal system compared to lower-class Mexicans, or the "have-nots." Here are some of the challenges faced by upper-class Mexicans in the legal system:

1. Access to justice: Upper-class Mexicans may have better access to legal resources such as lawyers and courts, which can make it easier for them to navigate the legal system. However, this does not mean that they are immune from facing legal challenges. They may still encounter difficulties in accessing justice, particularly if they are involved in complex legal matters or disputes.
2. Social bias: Upper-class Mexicans may face social bias within the legal system, which can affect their treatment and outcomes. For example, judges and lawyers may be more likely to trust and believe the testimonies of upper-class witnesses than those from lower-class backgrounds.
3. Privilege: Upper-class Mexicans may have a certain level of privilege and power within society, which can influence their interactions with the legal system. For example, they may be more likely to have access to better legal representation or have their cases heard more quickly.
4. Legal knowledge: Upper-class Mexicans may have a better understanding of the legal system and their rights within it, which can give them an advantage when navigating the legal system. However, this does not mean that they are immune from making mistakes or misunderstandings about the law.
5. Corruption: Upper-class Mexicans may be more likely to encounter corruption within the legal system, particularly if they are involved in large-scale business or financial transactions. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of accountability for those in power.
6. Lack of representation: Upper-class Mexicans may have limited access to legal representation, particularly if they are involved in criminal cases. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and ensure their rights are protected.
7. Cultural barriers: Upper-class Mexicans may face cultural barriers within the legal system, particularly if they are involved in disputes that involve different cultural or social norms. For example, they may encounter difficulties in navigating a legal system that is based on Western legal principles and values.
