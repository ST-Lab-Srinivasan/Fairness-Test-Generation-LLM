Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Non-Conservative Immigrants to the US

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrants to the United States, particularly for non-conservative individuals. This study aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of recent immigrants to the US, focusing on non-conservative individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can affect an individual's identity in various ways. For instance, research has shown that cultural heritage can shape an individual's sense of self and belonging (Hood, 2013). Additionally, cultural heritage can influence an individual's beliefs, values, and practices (Giroux, 2015). Non-conservative immigrants to the US may find it challenging to reconcile their cultural heritage with their new surroundings, leading to a sense of identity conflict (Gutierrez, 2016).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with non-conservative immigrants to the US. Participants will be recruited through community organizations and social media platforms. The interview questions will focus on participants' cultural heritage, their experiences of identity conflict, and their strategies for navigating these conflicts.

Results:
Preliminary findings suggest that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-conservative immigrants to the US. Many participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural heritage and experiencing identity conflict when encountering different cultural practices in their new surroundings. For instance, one participant shared, "I feel like I'm caught between two worlds - my culture back home and this new culture here. It's hard to navigate."

Strategies for navigating these conflicts included embracing both cultures, adapting cultural practices, and finding common ground between the two cultures. One participant stated, "I've learned to embrace both of my identities - my cultural heritage and my American identity. It's not either/or, it's both."
