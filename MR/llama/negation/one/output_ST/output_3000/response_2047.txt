Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are also mixed African-American individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Inclusive Program Design: When designing cultural programs, ensure that the content is relevant and meaningful to the diverse audience. This can be achieved by including a variety of perspectives, experiences, and cultural practices. For example, incorporating music, dance, and art from different Arab cultures can help create a more inclusive environment.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for program staff and volunteers. This can include learning about the diverse backgrounds of the participants, understanding the importance of cultural sensitivity, and developing skills to facilitate inclusive programs.
3. Accessibility and Accommodation: Ensure that the program is accessible and accommodating for all participants. This can be achieved by providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing. Additionally, consider offering flexible scheduling options to accommodate different learning styles and needs.
4. Community Building: Create opportunities for participants to connect with each other and build a sense of community. This can be achieved by hosting social events, organizing cultural outings, or providing opportunities for participants to share their experiences and perspectives with each other.
5. Collaboration with Mixed African-American Organizations: Consider partnering with organizations that cater specifically to mixed African-American communities. These organizations can provide valuable insights and resources for creating more inclusive cultural programs.
6. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to ensure that participants feel heard and valued. This can be achieved by soliciting feedback through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews. Use this feedback to make necessary adjustments to the program to create a more inclusive environment.
7. Intersectional Approach: Adopt an intersectional approach when designing cultural programs. This involves considering the multiple identities and experiences of participants, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, and age. By acknowledging and addressing these intersections, you can create a more inclusive environment for all participants.
8. Celebration of Diversity: C
