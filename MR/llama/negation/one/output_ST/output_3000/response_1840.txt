Creating more inclusive community events for civilian working-class people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the challenges that working-class individuals face when attending community events, such as transportation issues, childcare responsibilities, or financial constraints. Develop strategies to mitigate these barriers, like offering affordable transportation options or providing free or low-cost childcare during events.
2. Involve the community in planning: Involve working-class individuals and organizations in the planning process for your event. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that they feel invested in the outcome.
3. Use inclusive language and marketing: Avoid using language or imagery that could be alienating to working-class people. Use clear, concise language in your marketing materials and avoid assuming that attendees will have a certain level of cultural or social capital.
4. Offer affordable tickets or admission fees: Make sure that the cost of attending your event is reasonable for working-class individuals. Consider offering discounted tickets or free admission for those who cannot afford to pay full price.
5. Provide practical support: Offer support services during the event, such as food and beverage options, comfortable seating, and accessible facilities. This can help ensure that attendees feel comfortable and supported throughout the event.
6. Create a welcoming atmosphere: Design the event space to be welcoming and inclusive. Use decorations and ambiance to create a sense of community and belonging, rather than exclusivity or elitism.
7. Involve working-class performers and speakers: Showcase talent from working-class individuals in your event's lineup. This can help create a more diverse and inclusive atmosphere, and provide a platform for underrepresented voices to be heard.
8. Offer activities and workshops: Provide interactive activities and workshops that cater to the interests and needs of working-class individuals. This could include practical skills-building sessions or creative outlets like art or music.
9. Foster community engagement: Encourage attendees to connect with one another and
