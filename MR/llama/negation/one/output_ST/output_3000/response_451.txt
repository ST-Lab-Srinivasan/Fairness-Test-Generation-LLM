Supporting the social inclusion of natural-born Indian citizens aged over 90 years old (or over 85 years old) can be a challenging task, but there are several ways to make them feel included and valued in society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Age-friendly communities: Create age-friendly communities by designing public spaces, buildings, and transportation systems that are accessible and easy to navigate for older adults. This can include things like installing grab bars in bathrooms, widening doorways, and providing clear signage.
2. Social connections: Encourage older adults to stay connected with friends and family through regular social events, phone calls, or video chats. This can help reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.
3. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage older adults to volunteer in their communities, whether it's at a local charity or community organization. This can provide them with a sense of purpose and help them stay engaged with society.
4. Access to healthcare: Ensure that older adults have access to quality healthcare services, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health support.

6. Leisure activities: Encourage older adults to participate in leisure activities that they enjoy, such as gardening, painting, or playing musical instruments. This can help them stay engaged and active.

10. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and programs that
