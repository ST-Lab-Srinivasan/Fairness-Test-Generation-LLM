Ensuring that the educational needs of individuals in their late 30s who are experiencing poverty are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide access to adult education programs: Many individuals in their late 30s who are experiencing poverty may not have had the opportunity to complete their education earlier in life.
