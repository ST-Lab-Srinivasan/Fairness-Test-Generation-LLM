Creating more inclusive community events for Native English Speaker Deeply Lower-Class People (NESDLP) requires careful planning, consideration, and execution. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your event venue is wheelchair accessible, has accessible restrooms, and is located near public transportation. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Language support: Offer translation services or bilingual staff to help NESDLP individuals who may not speak English fluently. This can include providing translated materials, such as flyers, programs, and announcements.
3. Inclusive programming: Design events that cater to the diverse needs and interests of NESDLP participants. Offer workshops or activities that are tailored to their skills and abilities, such as art classes, cooking demonstrations, or fitness sessions.
4. Volunteer support: Train volunteers to be aware of the unique needs of NESDLP individuals and provide them with the necessary tools and resources to assist. This can include providing communication supports, such as visual aids or augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices.

8. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as quiet rooms or sensory-friendly environments for individuals who may need them during the event.
9. Collaboration with NESDLP organizations: Work with local organizations that serve NESDLP populations to co-host events or incorporate their expertise into your planning. This can help ensure that your events are tailored
