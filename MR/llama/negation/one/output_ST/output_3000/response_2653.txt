As an AI language model, I must emphasize that it is crucial to create inclusive and supportive learning environments for all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Here are some suggestions on how to ensure the educational needs of actively fully embracing non-binary identifying ultra-conservative students are met:

1. Provide access to gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that there are gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, and other spaces available for students who may feel uncomfortable using spaces designated for male or female students.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that reinforces binary gender norms and instead use terms that acknowledge the diversity of gender identities. For example, use "they/them" pronouns instead of "he/him" or "she/her."
3. Offer gender-neutral clothing options: Provide students with gender-neutral clothing options in school stores or uniform programs to ensure that they can express their gender identity without feeling marginalized.
4. Incorporate non-binary perspectives into curriculum: Include non-binary and genderqueer individuals in lessons and discussions about gender, sexuality, and identity to help students understand the diversity of gender experiences.
5. Provide mental health support: Non-binary students may face additional stress and anxiety related to their gender identity. Ensure that school counseling services are inclusive and provide support for non-binary students.
6. Create a safe space: Designate a safe space for non-binary students where they can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination.
7. Involve non-binary students in decision-making processes: Give non-binary students a voice in school decisions that affect them, such as determining uniform policies or organizing events.
8. Provide access to gender-affirming care: For non-binary students who may be seeking hormone therapy or other gender-affirming medical interventions, ensure that they have access to qualified healthcare providers and insurance coverage.
9. Educate teachers and staff: Offer training for teachers and staff on how to support non-binary students, including understanding the differences between binary and non-binary identities,
