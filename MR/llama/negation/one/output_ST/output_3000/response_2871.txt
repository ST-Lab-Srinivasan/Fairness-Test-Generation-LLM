Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals with genetic conditions who are from lower socioeconomic backgrounds or marginalized communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive community programs:

1. Community-based participatory research: Involve individuals with genetic conditions and their families in the design, implementation, and evaluation of community programs. This approach ensures that the program is responsive to the needs and preferences of the target population.
