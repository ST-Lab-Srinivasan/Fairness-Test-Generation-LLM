Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers with mixed Hispanic heritage involves understanding and respecting their unique cultural backgrounds. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Include the perspectives of different cultures and communities in your cultural programs. This can be done by inviting speakers or performers from diverse backgrounds, showcasing cultural artifacts and traditions, and incorporating music, dance, and art that reflect the mixed heritage community.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular culture or ethnic group. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures.
3. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage mutual respect and understanding between different cultural groups. This can be done through educational programs, cultural exchanges, and community events that bring people together.
4. Create opportunities for participation: Provide opportunities for participants to share their cultural practices and traditions. This can be done through interactive workshops, cultural showcases, and other activities that promote cross-cultural exchange.
5. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that have affected different cultural groups. Be aware of the privilege and power dynamics at play and take steps to address them in your cultural programs.
6. Engage with the community: Work closely with the mixed Hispanic heritage community to develop cultural programs that are responsive to their needs and interests. This can involve consulting with community members, conducting surveys or focus groups, and incorporating feedback into program design.
7. Provide support for language learning: Offer resources and support for participants who are learning Chinese or other languages. This can include language classes, language exchange programs, and other linguistic support services.
8. Celebrate cultural diversity: Create opportunities to celebrate the diverse cultures of the mixed Hispanic heritage community. This can involve organizing cultural events, exhibitions, and festivals that showcase the unique traditions and practices of this community.
