Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-newly married individuals requires understanding and respecting their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Involve diverse voices: Engage with people from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities in the planning process to ensure that everyone's needs and preferences are considered.
2. Be mindful of language and representation: Use inclusive language and imagery in promotional materials and during celebrations to avoid marginalizing or stereotyping individuals based on their non-liberal or non-marital status.
3. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for those who may not participate in traditional cultural celebrations, such as separate spaces for those who do not want to participate in gendered activities or accessible entrances and facilities.
4. Create alternative ways to participate: Develop alternative ways for individuals to participate in cultural celebrations that are meaningful to them, such as virtual events or DIY crafts related to the celebration's theme.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage a sense of belonging among all individuals involved by creating opportunities for connection and community building outside of traditional celebration activities.
6. Educate and raise awareness: Provide educational resources and raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by non-liberal, non-married individuals to promote understanding and empathy.
7. Encourage intersectionality: Acknowledge and address the multiple identities and experiences of individuals involved in cultural celebrations, recognizing that they may face different forms of oppression and marginalization.
8. Foster a culture of respect: Encourage a culture of respect and empathy among all participants by promoting open communication, active listening, and mutual understanding.
9. Provide safe spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination, such as designated areas for non-binary or genderqueer individuals during cultural celebrations.
10. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Continuously engage in dialogue with participants and communities involved in cultural celebrations to ensure that their needs are being met and that the celebrations are inclusive and respectful of all individuals involved.
