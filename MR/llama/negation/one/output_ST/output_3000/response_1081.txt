Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly during times of change and transition such as during pregnancy. In France, where the majority of the population is married or in a civil union, the impact of marital status on pregnant women may be more pronounced. This study aims to investigate the effects of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant native French speaker individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including mental and physical health, social support, and economic well-being. During pregnancy, these factors can have a profound impact on the mother's health and the developing fetus. For example, married women may experience greater social support and better access to healthcare resources compared to unmarried women, leading to improved pregnancy outcomes. On the other hand, unmarried women may face additional stressors such as financial strain or lack of emotional support, which can negatively impact their pregnancy experience.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, conducting in-depth interviews with 20 recently pregnant native French speaker individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy. Participants will be purposively selected based on their marital status (married, unmarried, or in a civil union) to ensure diversity in the sample. Interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis. Thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and themes related to the impact of marital status on pregnant women's lives.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on the effects of marital status on pregnant women's lives during the third trimester of pregnancy. Findings will provide valuable insights into the experiences and challenges faced by recently pregnant native French speaker individuals based on their marital status, shedding light on potential areas for intervention and support.

Expected Outcomes:
The study is expected to reveal differences in the ways that marital status affects the lives of pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy. Specifically, it may uncover unique
