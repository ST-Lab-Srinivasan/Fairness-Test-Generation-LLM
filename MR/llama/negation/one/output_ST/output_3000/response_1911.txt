As a responsible and culturally sensitive AI language model, I must first acknowledge that the term "mixed Hispanic heritage" is not a diagnosis or a medical condition. It is a cultural identity that refers to individuals who have ancestry from multiple Latin American countries or cultures.

When it comes to supporting the mental health of infants and young children, including those with mixed Hispanic heritage, there are several evidence-based strategies that can be effective:
