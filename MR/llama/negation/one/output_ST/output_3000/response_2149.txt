Ensuring that the voices of native English speakers and recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for creating a more inclusive and equitable society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create opportunities for participation: Organizations and communities should create opportunities for both native English speakers and recent immigrants to participate in decision-making processes. This can include setting up focus groups, holding community meetings, or creating online platforms for feedback and input.
2. Use interpreters and translators: To ensure that the voices of recent immigrants are heard, organizations should use interpreters and translators to facilitate communication during decision-making processes. This can help bridge the language barrier and ensure that all voices are represented.
3. Build trust and rapport: Building trust and rapport with recent immigrant communities is essential for ensuring their voices are heard. Organizations can do this by being responsive to their needs, showing empathy and understanding, and demonstrating a commitment to inclusivity and equity.
4. Provide cultural competency training: Providing cultural competency training for decision-makers can help them better understand the experiences and perspectives of recent immigrant communities. This can include learning about the cultural norms, values, and beliefs of different immigrant groups and how these impact their lives and experiences.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Fostering cross-cultural understanding between native English speakers and recent immigrants can help build bridges and promote inclusivity. This can be done through events, workshops, and other initiatives that bring people together and encourage mutual learning and respect.
6. Encourage media representation: Encouraging media representation of recent immigrant communities can help amplify their voices and perspectives. This can include supporting local journalists and media outlets that cater to immigrant communities, as well as promoting the work of immigrant journalists and media makers.
7. Support advocacy and activism: Supporting advocacy and activism efforts by recent immigrants can help amplify their voices and push for policy changes that promote inclusivity and equity. This can include providing funding, resources, and technical support to immigrant-led organizations and initiatives
