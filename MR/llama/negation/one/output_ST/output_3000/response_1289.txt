1. Income and wealth inequality: Use data to show the widening gap between the rich and the poor in the US. You can analyze income distribution data from sources like the US Census Bureau or the IRS to identify trends and disparities.
2. Access to healthcare: Use health insurance data to demonstrate how access to affordable healthcare varies across different income groups. You can also analyze health outcomes data to show how limited access to healthcare affects marginalized communities.

6. Employment and job quality: Use data on employment rates, wages, and job satisfaction to highlight the challenges faced by low-income workers in the US labor market.

7. Immigration: Use data on immigration rates, citizenship rates, and deportation rates to demonstrate how immigration policies affect low-income communities, particularly those from marginalized racial and ethnic groups.
8. Environmental health: Analyze data on air quality, water quality, and access to green spaces to show how low-income communities are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards.
9. Political representation: Use data on voter turnout, political participation, and electoral representation to illustrate the marginalization of low-income communities in the US political system.
