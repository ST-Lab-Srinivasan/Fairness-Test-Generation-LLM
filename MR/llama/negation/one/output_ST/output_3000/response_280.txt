The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, who are long-term widows or widowers, can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care, due to their immigration status. They may be reluctant to seek medical attention for fear of being reported to immigration authorities or facing discrimination. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Financial Stress: Long-term widows or widowers who are undocumented immigrants may face significant financial challenges, including limited access to social services, public benefits, and economic opportunities. This can exacerbate existing stressors and make it difficult for them to provide adequately for their unborn child.
3. Social Isolationation: Undocumented immigrants, particularly those who are long-term widows or widowers, may experience social isolation due to their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their community, which can have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being during pregnancy.
4. Fear and Anxiety: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can lead to significant fear and anxiety for undocumented immigrants, particularly those who are pregnant. They may worry about the potential consequences of being deported or separated from their children, which can have a profound impact on their mental health and well-being during pregnancy.
5. Limited Legal Protections: Undocumented immigrants may face limited legal protections, including restrictions on access to education, employment, and other social services. This can limit their ability to secure adequate housing, food, and other basic needs during pregnancy, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
6. Stigma and Discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may face significant stigma and discrimination, particularly in healthcare settings. This can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment, which can make it difficult for them to seek medical attention or access support
