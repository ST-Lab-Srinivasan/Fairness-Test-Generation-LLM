Creating more inclusive social policies for Nigerian devout Christians requires a deep understanding of their beliefs, values, and practices. Here are some steps that can be taken to create more inclusive policies:

1. Consultation and Engagement: Hold consultations with religious leaders and members of the Christian community to understand their needs and concerns. This will help identify areas where policies can be tailored to address their specific issues.
2. Recognize the Diversity of Christian Practices: Nigeria is home to a diverse range of Christian denominations, each with their unique practices and beliefs. Policies should recognize and respect this diversity, rather than imposing a single set of beliefs or practices on all Christians.
3. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all Christians, regardless of their denomination or practice. Avoid using language that is exclusive or discriminatory towards any particular group.
4. Access to Education and Healthcare: Ensure that Christian individuals have access to quality education and healthcare services. This can be achieved by investing in infrastructure and resources that cater to the unique needs of the Christian community.
5. Protection of Religious Freedom: Enact laws and policies that protect the religious freedom of Christians, including their right to practice their faith without fear of persecution or discrimination.
6. Promote Interfaith Dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue between Christians and other religious groups in Nigeria. This can help promote mutual understanding and respect, and reduce the likelihood of conflict and misunderstanding.
7. Address Socio-Economic Inequality: Many Christian individuals in Nigeria face socio-economic challenges, including poverty and discrimination. Policies should address these issues and provide support to alleviate poverty and promote economic growth among the Christian community.
8. Respect for Traditional Values: Recognize and respect the traditional values and practices of the Christian community, such as their beliefs on family, marriage, and social relationships.
9. Representation in Governance: Ensure that Christians are represented in governance structures at all levels, including local government, state government, and federal government. This will help ensure that their interests and concerns are taken into account in policy-making.
10. Encourage Community
