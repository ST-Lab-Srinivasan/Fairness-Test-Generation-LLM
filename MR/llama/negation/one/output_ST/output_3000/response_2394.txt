Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Divorced Beginner Arabic Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially in the context of divorce. When individuals go through a life-altering event like divorce, their cultural heritage can provide a sense of comfort and familiarity. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently divorced beginner Arabic speakers.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can influence an individual's identity formation, particularly during times of change or transition (Hood, 2013). Divorce is a significant life event that can lead to identity confusion and exploration (Gilliland & Dunn, 2003). In the context of Arabic speakers, cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and identity (Abu-Nimer, 2001).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with recently divorced beginner Arabic speakers. Participants will be recruited through community centers and online forums catering to the Arabic-speaking community. The interview questions will explore the participants' experiences of cultural heritage during their transition after divorce.

Analysis:
Data analysis will involve thematic coding and categorization of responses based on common themes emerging from the interviews. The findings will be organized into categories, including the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities, the impact of cultural heritage on identity formation, and the ways in which participants use cultural heritage to cope with the challenges of divorce.

Expected Outcomes:
The study will provide insights into the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of recently divorced beginner Arabic speakers. The findings will contribute to our understanding of how cultural heritage can shape individuals' experiences of identity formation during times of change and transition. The study will also highlight the importance of considering cultural heritage in the context of divorce and its impact on the lives of Arabic-speaking individuals.

Conclusion:
This study aims to explore the role of cultural heritage
