Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of expecting Nigerian individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Stigma: Expecting outside of marriage can be met with social stigma, particularly in traditional and conservative communities. This can lead to feelings of shame, isolation, and even ostracism.
