Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of natural-born Canadian citizen mixed Asian heritage people, as it shapes their identity, influences their values, and informs their sense of belonging. Here are some ways cultural heritage impacts their lives:

1. Sense of belonging: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may feel a sense of belonging to multiple cultures, which can be both empowering and challenging. They may feel torn between their Canadian identity and their cultural heritage, or they may feel that they don't fully belong in either group.

3. Cultural practices and traditions: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may celebrate and practice multiple cultural traditions, such as Chinese New Year, Diwali, and Christmas. This can create a rich and diverse cultural experience, but it can also be overwhelming and exhausting.
4. Intersectionality of identities: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may experience intersectionality of their identities, where their cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of their identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, or socioeconomic status. This can create unique challenges and opportunities for self-expression and self-discovery.
5. Internalized oppression: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may internalize the oppression they face, either from their own cultural groups or from external sources. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy, shame, or low self-esteem.
