Here are some ways to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Remove the Stigma: Divorce and remarriage should no longer be stigmatized, and individuals who have been married multiple times should be treated with respect and dignity. Social policies should aim to promote a culture of acceptance and inclusivity, rather than discrimination or marginalization.
