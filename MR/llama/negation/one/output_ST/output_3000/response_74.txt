Creating more inclusive social policies for working-class unmarried individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Income support: Unmarried workers often lack access to financial safety nets, such as spousal benefits or inheritance rights. Governments can establish universal basic income (UBI) programs or enhance existing social welfare systems to provide a minimum level of income to all individuals, regardless of marital status.
2. Housing support: Many unmarried workers struggle with affordable housing options, particularly in urban areas. Governments can introduce rent control measures, increase funding for affordable housing projects, and provide subsidies or tax breaks for low-income renters.
3. Education and training: Unmarried individuals may face barriers to education and job training due to financial constraints. Governments can offer scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial assistance to help them pursue their educational goals.
4. Childcare support: Single parents or those without children may still face significant childcare costs. Governments can establish affordable childcare programs, provide subsidies for working parents, and offer tax credits for childcare expenses.
5. Healthcare access: Unmarried workers may have limited access to healthcare due to their income level or lack of access to employer-based coverage. Governments can introduce universal healthcare systems, expand Medicaid programs, or provide subsidies for low-income individuals to purchase health insurance.
6. Employment protections: Unmarried workers may face discrimination in the workplace due to their marital status. Governments can pass laws that protect them from employment discrimination and ensure equal pay for equal work.
7. Social isolation: Unmarried individuals may experience social isolation, which can have negative effects on mental health. Governments can invest in community programs, such as mentorship initiatives or social clubs, to help build connections between people of different backgrounds.
8. Family-friendly policies: Many unmarried workers face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities due to lack of support from employers. Governments can encourage employers to offer flexible working arrangements, parental leave policies, and other family-friendly benefits.
