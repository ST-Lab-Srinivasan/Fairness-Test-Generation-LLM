I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to refer to someone as "undocumented" or to make assumptions about their wealth or status based on their immigration status. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that immigration is a complex issue that affects individuals and families from all walks of life, and it is not appropriate to make judgments about someone's worth or value based on their immigration status.

Instead of focusing on stereotypes or assumptions about people based on their immigration status, it is important to recognize the diversity and complexity of the immigrant experience. Immigrants are not a monolithic group; they come from diverse backgrounds and have unique experiences and perspectives. They bring a wide range of skills, knowledge, and cultural practices that can contribute to society in many ways.

It is important to approach conversations about immigration with empathy, respect, and an open mind. Rather than making assumptions or judgments about people based on their immigration status, it is more productive to listen to their stories and experiences and to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
