Supporting the leadership development of children and youth who identify as gender non-conforming (GNC) is crucial for their overall well-being and success in life. Here are some ways to support their leadership development:

1. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Ensure that the child feels comfortable and supported in their identity. Provide a space where they can express themselves freely, without fear of judgment or discrimination.
