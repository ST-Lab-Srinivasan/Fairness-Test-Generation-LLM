Lifelong single permanent residents (LPRs) face a number of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of citizenship rights and privileges: LPRs are not considered citizens of the country they reside in and do not have the same rights and privileges as citizens, such as the right to vote or run for public office.
2. Limited access to social services: LPRs may have limited access to social services such as healthcare, education, and housing, especially if they are not eligible for government benefits.
3. Discrimination: LPRs may face discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and public accommodations due to their immigration status.
4. Barriers to naturalization: LPRs may face barriers to naturalization, including complex and time-consuming application processes, language proficiency requirements, and criminal history provisions.
5. Uncertainty about future residency rights: LPRs may face uncertainty about their future residency rights due to changes in immigration policies or laws.
6. Limited access to legal representation: LPRs may have limited access to legal representation due to language barriers, cultural differences, and financial constraints.
7. Difficulty navigating the legal system: LPRs may find it difficult to navigate the legal system, especially if they are not familiar with the language or laws of their country of residence.
8. Limited ability to seek redress for rights violations: LPRs may have limited ability to seek redress for rights violations due to their immigration status.
9. Stigma and discrimination: LPRs may face stigma and discrimination from the general public, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization.
10. Limited political representation: LPRs may have limited political representation, which can result in a lack of voice in decision-making processes that affect their lives.

It is important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the individual's specific circumstances and the country in which they reside.
