Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Spanish-speaking ethnic Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms that stereotype or marginalize specific ethnic groups. For example, instead of using the term "Asian," use "Latinx" or "Hispanic and Latin American."
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that your cultural programs reflect the diversity of your audience. Use images, music, and stories that represent the different cultures and experiences of native Spanish-speaking ethnic Asian individuals.
3. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for staff and volunteers on cultural competency and inclusivity. This can help them understand the unique needs and experiences of diverse audiences and create programs that are more inclusive.
4. Community Outreach: Engage with local ethnic Asian communities to better understand their cultural practices and traditions. Reach out to community leaders, organizations, and individuals to build relationships and develop culturally sensitive programming.
5. Involve Community Members: Involve members of the ethnic Asian community in the development and implementation of cultural programs. This can help ensure that programs are responsive to their needs and reflect their experiences and perspectives.
6. Flexibility and Accommodation: Be flexible and accommodating when planning cultural events. Offer a variety of activities, such as language classes, cultural workshops, or social events, that cater to different interests and needs.
7. Accessibility: Ensure that your cultural programs are accessible to all, including individuals with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or wheelchair accessibility.
8. Collaboration: Collaborate with other organizations and community groups to create more inclusive cultural programs. Partner with local ethnic Asian organizations to co-create programming that is responsive to their needs and interests.
9. Evaluation and Feedback: Regularly evaluate and solicit feedback from the ethnic Asian community on your cultural programs. Use this information to make improvements and adjustments to ensure that programs are meeting their needs and expectations.
