I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "strongly homosexual" is not a valid or respectful way to refer to individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

To address the issues faced by LGBTQ+ individuals who are not widowed for a long time, it is important to gather data that captures their experiences and challenges. This can involve conducting surveys, focus groups, or interviews with members of the LGBTQ+ community. The data collected can help identify specific issues and challenges faced by this group, such as discrimination, stigma, and social isolation.

Some potential data points to consider when gathering information on this topic might include:

1. Demographic information: Collect data on the age, gender, race/ethnicity, and geographic location of LGBTQ+ individuals who are not widowed for a long time.
2. Social and economic status: Gather data on the socioeconomic status of LGBTQ+ individuals, including their income level, education level, and employment status.
3. Mental health and well-being: Collect data on the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals, including their levels of anxiety, depression, and overall life satisfaction.
4. Relationship dynamics: Gather data on the relationship dynamics of LGBTQ+ individuals, including their experiences with dating, relationships, and family support.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Collect data on the experiences of discrimination and stigma faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, including their experiences with bullying, harassment, and violence.
6. Access to healthcare: Gather data on the access to healthcare services for LGBTQ+ individuals, including their experiences with healthcare providers and the availability of gender-affirming care.
7. Community involvement: Collect data on the level of involvement in the LGBTQ+ community, including their participation in LGBTQ+ organizations, events, and activism.
8. Political and legal issues: Gather data on the political and legal issues affecting LGBTQ+ individuals
