Protecting the legal rights of non-long-time married civilian individuals is essential to ensure their equality and protection under the law. Here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Adopt a comprehensive legal framework: Governments can establish a comprehensive legal framework that recognizes the rights of non-long-time married couples. This framework should provide for equal rights and benefits, including inheritance, property rights, and decision-making authority.
2. Recognize common-law relationships: Non-long-time married couples may not have the same legal protections as married couples, but they can still establish common-law relationships. Governments can recognize these relationships and provide legal recognition, such as joint property ownership or inheritance rights.
3. Provide legal support services: Governments can provide legal support services to non-long-time married couples, including legal aid and advice. This can help ensure that they understand their legal rights and can access the legal support they need.
