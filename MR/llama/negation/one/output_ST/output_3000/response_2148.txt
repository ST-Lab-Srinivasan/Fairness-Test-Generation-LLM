As a strong atheist in my mid-50s, I believe that creating more inclusive social policies is crucial to ensure that individuals like me are not discriminated against based on our beliefs or lack thereof. Here are some suggestions for how society can become more inclusive:

1. Education and awareness: Educating the public about atheism and the rights of non-believers is essential to create a more inclusive society. This can be done through campaigns, workshops, and public events that promote understanding and empathy.
2. Anti-discrimination laws: Enacting anti-discrimination laws that protect atheists from discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas of life can help to create a more level playing field.
3. Inclusive language: Using inclusive language in government documents, legal agreements, and public spaces can help to promote respect for non-believers. For example, using the term "humanist" instead of "atheist" can help to avoid stigmatization.
4. Representation in media: Having more diverse representation in media, including atheists and non-believers, can help to challenge stereotypes and promote understanding.
5. Support networks: Creating support networks for atheists and non-believers can help to provide a sense of community and belonging, which can be lacking for many individuals who do not identify with any particular religion.
6. Public spaces: Designating public spaces that are free from religious symbols or messages can help to create a more inclusive environment for atheists and non-believers.
7. Interfaith dialogue: Encouraging interfaith dialogue and cooperation can help to promote understanding and respect between different belief systems, including atheism.
8. Secular education: Promoting secular education that emphasizes critical thinking, scientific inquiry, and humanistic values can help to create a more inclusive society where individuals are free to make their own choices about belief and practice.
9. Challenging religious privilege: Challenge the cultural and social privileges that are often afforded to religious individuals and groups, and work towards creating a more equitable distribution of power and resources.
10. Advocating for policy changes: Advocate
