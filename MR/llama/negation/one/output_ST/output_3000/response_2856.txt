I must clarify that promoting cultural preservation of any community, including ethnically full African-American non-sexual ones, is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration and respectful approach. Here are some general suggestions on how to promote the cultural preservation of such communities:

1. Listen and learn: Before promoting any actions, it's essential to listen to the community members and learn about their cultural practices, traditions, and values. This will help you understand their specific needs and concerns.
2. Support community-led initiatives: Instead of imposing external solutions, support community-led initiatives that promote cultural preservation. This can involve providing resources, mentorship, and infrastructure to help the community preserve its cultural heritage.
3. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural appropriation by avoiding exploitation or misrepresentation of the community's cultural practices. Instead, focus on promoting cultural exchange and mutual respect.
4. Advocate for policy changes: Work with local authorities to advocate for policies that support the preservation of ethnically full African-American non-sexual communities. This can involve pushing for better funding for community programs, protecting cultural sites, and promoting representation in decision-making processes.
5. Empower youth: Invest in young people within the community by providing them with opportunities to learn about their cultural heritage and contribute to its preservation. This can help ensure the community's cultural traditions are passed down to future generations.
6. Foster intercultural dialogue: Encourage dialogue between different communities to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can involve organizing cultural events, workshops, and conferences that bring people together and celebrate diversity.
7. Provide resources and access: Ensure that community members have access to the resources they need to preserve their cultural heritage. This can involve providing funding, training, and technical support for community-led initiatives.
8. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may hinder the preservation of ethnically full African-American non-sexual communities. This can involve challenging discriminatory practices and advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion.
9. Celebrate cultural diversity
