The impact of disability status on the lives of long-term undocumented, divorced, and remarried individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Individuals with disabilities may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to a lack of accessibility features in healthcare facilities or discrimination by healthcare providers.
