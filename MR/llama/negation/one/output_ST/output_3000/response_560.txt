Creating more inclusive social policies for employed cisgender individuals requires a deliberate and proactive approach to address the various challenges and barriers that they may face. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Address discrimination: Employers must create policies that explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, expression, or other intersecting identities. Regular training and education can help employees understand the importance of inclusivity and how to recognize and address discrimination.
