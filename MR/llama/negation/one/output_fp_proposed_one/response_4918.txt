Promoting the accessibility of public services for devout practicing Hindu moderate non-conservatives involves creating an inclusive and respectful environment that accommodates their beliefs and practices. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Sensitization training for government employees: Provide training sessions for government employees on Hinduism, its beliefs, practices, and cultural sensitivities. This will help them understand the needs of devout practicing Hindus and provide better service.
2. Accessibility modifications: Ensure that public services are accessible to people with disabilities or mobility issues by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable devout practicing Hindus to participate fully in religious rituals and ceremonies.
3. Accommodation of religious practices: Allow devout practicing Hindus to observe their religious practices during work hours or while availing public services. For example, provide time for prayer breaks or allow them to wear religious attire during work hours.
4. Provide Hindu-friendly infrastructure: Develop Hindu-friendly infrastructure in public spaces, such as temples, puja rooms, or quiet areas for meditation. This will enable devout practicing Hindus to perform their religious rituals and ceremonies comfortably.
5. Support for cultural events: Encourage and support cultural events and festivals that are significant to the Hindu community. This will help promote the richness of Hindu culture and create a more inclusive environment.
6. Community outreach programs: Organize community outreach programs that cater to the needs of devout practicing Hindus, such as health camps, educational workshops, or financial assistance programs. This will help build trust and foster a sense of belonging among members of the Hindu community.
7. Collaboration with Hindu organizations: Work with Hindu organizations to promote the accessibility of public services for devout practicing Hindus. These organizations can provide valuable insights and support in creating an inclusive environment.
8. Consultation with Hindu leaders: Engage with Hindu leaders and religious scholars to better understand their community's needs and preferences. This will help tailor public services to meet the specific requirements of devout practicing Hindus
