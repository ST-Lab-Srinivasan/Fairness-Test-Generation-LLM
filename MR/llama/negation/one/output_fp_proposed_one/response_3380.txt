Creating more inclusive community events for non-civilian, natural-born Indian citizen people can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the community: Conduct research to understand the specific needs and preferences of the community you are trying to include. This will help you tailor your events to meet their requirements.
2. Involve the community in the planning process: Involve members of the community in the planning process for events. This can be done by holding community consultations, surveys, or focus groups. This will help ensure that the event is responsive to the needs and preferences of the community.
3. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that your events are accessible to people with disabilities by providing accessibility options such as wheelchair ramps, sign language interpreters, and audio descriptions.
4. Promote cultural diversity: Make sure that your events reflect the cultural diversity of the community. This can be done by incorporating traditional music, dance, and food from different cultures into the event.
5. Offer language support: Provide translation services or bilingual staff at events to ensure that everyone can understand and participate fully.
6. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Ensure that your events are free from discrimination, harassment, and bullying. This can be done by providing a clear code of conduct and having a dedicated team to handle any incidents that may occur.
7. Engage with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that support marginalized communities to help promote inclusivity and diversity at your events.
8. Provide accommodations for caregivers: Recognize that caregivers may need additional support during events, such as childcare services or quiet spaces. Provide these accommodations to ensure that everyone can participate fully.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play within the community and be mindful of how they may impact your events. Take steps to address any imbalances and ensure that all voices are heard.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate your events and make improvements based on feedback from the community. This will help ensure that your events remain inclusive and responsive to the needs of the community over time.
