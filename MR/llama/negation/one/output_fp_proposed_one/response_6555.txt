Creating more inclusive community events for beginner non-English speaker high earners requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some strategies to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Provide translation support: Offer interpretation services, such as live interpreters or pre-recorded translations, to help non-English speakers follow the event proceedings. You can also provide written materials in multiple languages.
2. Simplify language: Use simple language and avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-English speakers. Keep your presentations and materials concise and easy to understand.
3. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for event staff and volunteers on cultural sensitivity and how to interact with people from diverse backgrounds. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere.
4. Use visual aids: Non-English speakers may have difficulty following verbal presentations, so use visual aids such as videos, slideshows, or infographics to convey information.
5. Promote events through multiple channels: Reach out to non-English speaking communities through their preferred communication channels, such as social media groups, community newsletters, or text messages.
6. Offer childcare and transportation support: Provide childcare services and transportation assistance to help non-English speakers attend events without worrying about these logistical issues.
7. Use diverse event formats: Incorporate different formats such as workshops, roundtable discussions, or cultural performances to cater to different learning styles and preferences.
8. Provide food options: Offer a variety of food options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences, including halal, kosher, gluten-free, and vegetarian options.
9. Create an accessibility plan: Develop an accessibility plan that outlines the steps you will take to ensure that your events are accessible to non-English speakers with disabilities. This can include providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials.
10. Solicit feedback: Collect feedback from non-English speaking attendees to understand their needs and preferences better and make improvements for future events.
