Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of non-young adult (20s) soft libertarians by providing guidance, support, and exposure to new ideas and perspectives. Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Clarifying values and beliefs: As individuals transition into adulthood, they may struggle to articulate their core values and beliefs. A mentor can help them identify and clarify their soft libertarian views by asking questions, sharing experiences, and providing feedback.
2. Building critical thinking skills: Soft libertarians often face challenges in articulating their ideas and navigating complex social issues. Mentors can help them develop critical thinking skills by encouraging them to question assumptions, evaluate evidence, and consider multiple perspectives.
3. Networking opportunities: A mentor can introduce the individual to a network of like-minded individuals, providing opportunities for discussion, collaboration, and learning from others. This can help deepen their understanding of soft libertarianism and its applications in various domains.
4. Personal development: Mentors can offer guidance on how to navigate personal and professional challenges while remaining true to one's beliefs. They can share insights on time management, goal-setting, and emotional intelligence, which are essential for effective communication and collaboration.
5. Exposure to new ideas: A mentor can introduce the individual to diverse perspectives and ways of thinking, helping them broaden their understanding of soft libertarianism and its relationship with other ideologies. This exposure can foster a more nuanced and informed worldview.
6. Role modeling: By demonstrating how to live out one's beliefs in practice, mentors can inspire and guide non-young adult soft libertarians in their personal and professional lives. This can involve sharing successes and failures, highlighting the importance of resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing world.
7. Providing resources: A mentor can offer access to relevant books, articles, and events that can help deepen the individual's understanding of soft libertarianism and its applications. This exposure can broaden their knowledge base and enhance their critical thinking skills.
8. Facilitating connections: Mentors can help establish connections between the individual and influential
