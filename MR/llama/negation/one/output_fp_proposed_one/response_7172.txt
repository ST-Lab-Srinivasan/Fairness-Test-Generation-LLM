Creating more inclusive community programs for non-Nigerian recently divorced individuals requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Be aware of the cultural differences and nuances that may affect how these individuals interact with your program. Be sensitive to their cultural practices and beliefs, and make sure your program is inclusive of their cultural backgrounds.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that your program is accessible to individuals with different abilities and disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and materials in braille or large print for those who may need them.
3. Language support: Offer language support for non-English speakers, including translation services and interpreters. This can help ensure that individuals feel comfortable and included in your program.
4. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive marketing strategies to reach out to diverse populations. Use language that is inclusive and respectful of different cultures, and avoid stereotypes or assumptions based on race, ethnicity, or cultural background.
5. Partnership with community organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that cater to non-Nigerian recently divorced individuals. This can help you reach a broader audience and provide more tailored support.
6. Education and training: Offer education and training on cultural sensitivity, diversity, and inclusion. This can help your program staff and volunteers better understand the needs of diverse populations and provide more effective support.
7. Involve community leaders: Engage community leaders from diverse backgrounds to help design and implement your program. This can ensure that your program is culturally appropriate and sensitive to the needs of different communities.
8. Flexible programming: Offer flexible programming that can accommodate different schedules and needs. For example, provide online or hybrid programs for individuals who may have difficulty attending in-person events.
9. Access to resources: Provide access to resources such as legal aid, financial assistance, and mental health support. This can help individuals overcome specific challenges they may face after divorce.
10. Creating safe spaces: Create safe spaces where individuals from diverse backgrounds can connect and support each other. This can involve hosting events or creating online forums where individuals can share their experiences and support one another.
