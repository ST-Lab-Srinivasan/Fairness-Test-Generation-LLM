To ensure that the healthcare needs of non-Nigerian middle-class people are met, it is important to adopt a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various factors that impact their access to quality healthcare. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Increase access to health insurance: Non-Nigerian middle-class people may face challenges in accessing affordable health insurance, which can limit their ability to receive quality medical care.
