Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for ensuring that non-active duty Native American and recent immigrants to the US receive quality care that takes into account their unique cultural backgrounds. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these populations:

1. Improved patient satisfaction: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they are better able to understand and address the specific needs and concerns of non-active duty Native American and recent immigrant patients. This can lead to higher patient satisfaction and better overall care.
2. Accurate diagnosis and treatment: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers recognize the role that cultural beliefs and practices play in a patient's health. For example, some Native American communities may have traditional healing practices that are distinct from Western medicine. By understanding these practices, healthcare providers can provide more accurate diagnoses and treatments.
