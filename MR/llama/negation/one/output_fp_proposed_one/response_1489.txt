I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or specific data on the socioeconomic status of individuals. However, I can suggest some successful community initiatives led by native non-French speaker upper upper middle-income individuals:

1. Language Learning Apps: There are several language learning apps developed by non-French speakers that have gained popularity worldwide. Examples include Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone. These apps use gamification and interactive tools to teach users new languages, making it easier for them to learn and practice.
2. Cultural Exchange Programs: Many organizations and individuals from upper middle-income countries have created cultural exchange programs that enable people to experience different cultures firsthand. For example, the International Cultural Youth Exchange (ICYE) program allows young people from around the world to participate in cultural immersion experiences in different countries.
3. Microfinance Initiatives: Non-French speakers have also started microfinance initiatives aimed at providing financial services to underprivileged communities. Examples include Kiva, a platform that connects lenders with entrepreneurs in developing countries, and the Grameen Bank, which provides microloans to women in Bangladesh.
4. Renewable Energy Projects: Upper middle-income individuals from non-French speaking countries have also been involved in renewable energy projects. For instance, the SolarAid organization, founded by a British entrepreneur, aims to provide access to clean energy for communities in Africa and Asia through solar lighting and power systems.
5. Community Development Projects: Many non-French speakers have led community development projects in their home countries or in other regions of the world. For example, the Peace Corps, which was founded by a United States president, has over 7,000 volunteers working in more than 60 countries to promote peace and development.
6. Education Initiatives: Non-French speakers have also started education initiatives aimed at improving access to quality education for disadvantaged groups. Examples include the Varkey Foundation, which aims to provide education for marginalized children worldwide, and the Malala Fund, which works towards providing education for girls in countries with limited access to education.
