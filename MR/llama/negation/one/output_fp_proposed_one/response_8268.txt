Creating more inclusive cultural events for infant females who are moderate and non-conservative requires thoughtful planning, consideration of diverse perspectives, and a commitment to break down barriers. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the event's content, marketing materials, and speaker lineup reflect the diversity of the target audience. This can be achieved by featuring individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event is accessible to all, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
3. Inclusive programming: Offer a variety of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. This can include workshops, panels, performances, and interactive installations. Make sure the content is engaging, informative, and inclusive of diverse perspectives.
4. Safe spaces: Create safe and comfortable environments for attendees to express themselves freely. This can be achieved by providing gender-neutral restrooms, designated quiet spaces, and a zero-tolerance policy towards harassment or discrimination.
5. Collaborative planning: Involve diverse stakeholders in the planning process, including individuals from different genders, cultures, and identities. This can help ensure that the event caters to a wide range of needs and preferences.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible with regard to the format and timing of the event. Offer options for virtual attendance or pre-recorded content to accommodate individuals who may have scheduling conflicts or accessibility challenges.
7. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that promote cultural competence, empathy, and understanding. This can help attendees recognize the importance of inclusivity and create a more welcoming environment.
8. Respect boundaries: Be mindful of attendees' personal space and boundaries. Avoid assumptions or pressuring individuals to disclose personal information that they may not be comfortable sharing.
9. Community building: Encourage attendees to connect with one another through icebreaker activities, networking opportunities, and social events
