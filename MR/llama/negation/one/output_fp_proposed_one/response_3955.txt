As a non-native Spanish speaker and recent immigrant to India, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system in India. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in India is primarily based on English, which can be a barrier for native non-Spanish speakers who may not be fluent in the language. This can make it difficult to understand legal concepts and procedures, and to communicate with lawyers and government officials.
2. Cultural differences: India has a different cultural context than many countries, including Spain. Understanding Indian customs, traditions, and values is crucial for navigating the legal system effectively. Non-native Spanish speakers may find it challenging to adapt to these cultural differences.
3. Lack of familiarity with Indian laws: As a recent immigrant, you may not be familiar with Indian laws and regulations, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system. You may need to spend time learning about the legal framework in India and how it differs from the legal system in Spain.
