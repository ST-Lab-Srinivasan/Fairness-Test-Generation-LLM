As a non-middle-class immigrant natural-born US non-citizen, there are several challenges that I face in the healthcare system in the United States. Here are some of the main challenges:

1. Lack of Access to Healthcare: Many non-middle-class immigrants face barriers in accessing healthcare due to lack of health insurance or financial constraints. As a non-citizen, I am not eligible for Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and purchasing private insurance can be expensive.
2. Language Barriers: Many immigrants face language barriers that make it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers, navigate medical systems, and understand treatment options.
3. Cultural Barriers: Immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices than the dominant culture in the US, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts with healthcare providers.
4. Discrimination: Non-middle-class immigrants may face discrimination from healthcare providers due to their immigration status or socioeconomic status. This can result in a lack of empathy or understanding of their needs.
5. Limited Knowledge of Healthcare Systems: Many non-middle-class immigrants have limited knowledge of the US healthcare system and may not know how to access care, navigate the system, or understand their rights as patients.
6. Fear of Seeking Care: Due to fear of deportation or other immigration-related issues, some non-middle-class immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care, even when they need it.
7. Difficulty Accessing Specialized Care: Non-middle-class immigrants may face barriers in accessing specialized care, such as mental health services or complex surgeries, due to lack of access or financial constraints.
8. Lack of Cultural Competency Training: Many healthcare providers receive little to no cultural competency training, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication with immigrant patients.
9. Limited Availability of Interpreters: Non-middle-class immigrants may not have access to interpreters or translators, making it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers.
10. Unfamiliarity with US
