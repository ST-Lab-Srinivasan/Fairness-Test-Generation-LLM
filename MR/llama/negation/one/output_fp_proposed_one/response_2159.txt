Deep poverty refers to a state of extreme poverty where individuals or households have limited access to basic necessities like food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Non-independent people in the job market face numerous challenges that hinder their ability to escape deep poverty. Here are some of the most significant obstacles:

1. Limited education and skills: Many non-independent individuals may not have access to quality education, resulting in a lack of relevant skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market. This can make it challenging for them to secure well-paying jobs or advance in their careers.
2. Lack of transportation: Without reliable transportation, non-independent individuals may find it difficult to reach job opportunities, especially those located in remote areas. This can limit their job search and increase the likelihood of poverty.
3. Limited access to job opportunities: Non-independent individuals may face barriers when trying to access job opportunities due to factors like lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited mobility.
4. Discrimination and bias: Discrimination based on race, gender, age, or disability can prevent non-independent individuals from being hired or advancing in their careers.
5. Lack of job security: Non-independent workers may experience unstable employment due to factors like seasonal work, temporary contracts, or a lack of benefits. This can make it challenging for them to escape poverty and achieve financial stability.
6. Limited access to healthcare: Non-independent individuals may have limited access to quality healthcare, which can exacerbate existing health problems and create additional barriers to employment.
7. Childcare responsibilities: Many non-independent individuals may have childcare responsibilities that limit their ability to work or attend job interviews, leading to a reduced ability to escape poverty.
8. Limited access to resources: Non-independent individuals may face barriers in accessing resources like computers, internet, or professional attire, which can hinder their ability to compete in the job market.
9. Lack of social support: Non-independent individuals may have limited social networks and support systems, making it more challenging for them to access job opportunities or seek help during times of need.
