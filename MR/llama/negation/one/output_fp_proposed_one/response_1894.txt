Supporting the civic engagement of cisgender beginner non-Spanish speakers can be done in several ways:

1. Provide language classes: Offer free or low-cost language classes specifically designed for beginners and non-native speakers. This will help them improve their Spanish skills and become more comfortable communicating in the language.
2. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that any civic engagement events or activities are accessible and inclusive to all, regardless of their gender identity or language proficiency. Use clear communication and visual aids to facilitate participation.
3. Offer interpretation services: Provide interpretation services during civic engagement events, such as simultaneous interpretation through headsets or live translation via a screen. This will help non-Spanish speakers fully participate in the discussions and decision-making processes.
4. Develop culturally responsive materials: Create educational materials that are culturally responsive and tailored to the needs of beginner non-Spanish speakers. This could include visual aids, infographics, or interactive presentations that explain complex concepts in an accessible way.
5. Build partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations that serve non-Spanish speaking populations, such as immigrant advocacy groups or language schools. These partnerships can help expand the reach of your civic engagement efforts and provide additional support to these communities.
6. Leverage technology: Utilize digital tools and platforms to connect with beginner non-Spanish speakers and provide them with resources and information. This could include social media campaigns, online forums, or mobile apps that offer interactive learning experiences.
7. Provide mentorship opportunities: Pair beginner non-Spanish speakers with experienced civic engagement advocates who can guide and support them throughout the process. This could involve one-on-one mentoring or group mentorship sessions.
8. Offer childcare and transportation services: Recognize that many beginner non-Spanish speakers may face additional barriers to civic engagement, such as lack of access to childcare or transportation. Provide these services to help remove these barriers and ensure that everyone can fully participate.
9. Prioritize accessible venues: Choose venues for civic engagement events that are wheelchair accessible
