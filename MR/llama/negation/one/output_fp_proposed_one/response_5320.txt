Creating more inclusive public spaces for young adults in their 20s, who are secular and non-Jewish, requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions on how to create such spaces:

1. Foster a sense of belonging: Non-Jewish young adults may feel marginalized or excluded from Jewish communal spaces.

Organize interfaith events, workshops, or discussions where non-Jewish young adults can learn from and engage with Jewish communities. This will help build bridges of understanding and foster a sense of mutual respect.

Create public spaces that offer opportunities for young adults to connect, such as volunteer events, happy hours, or casual gatherings.

Offer educational programs, such as lectures, workshops, or classes, that provide an introduction to Judaism and its values. This will help them feel more informed and connected to the Jewish community.
5. Foster a sense of ownership: Encourage non-Jewish young adults to take an active role in shaping their public spaces. Provide opportunities for them to contribute their ideas, feedback, and perspectives on how to make these spaces more inclusive and welcoming. This will help them feel invested in the community and more likely to participate in its activities.
