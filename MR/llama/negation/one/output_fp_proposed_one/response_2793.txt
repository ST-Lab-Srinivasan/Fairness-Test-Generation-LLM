As a society, creating more inclusive social policies for wealthy formerly non-married individuals requires acknowledging the unique challenges and experiences of this group. Here are some potential strategies for promoting greater inclusivity:

1. Recognize the changing family landscape: The traditional nuclear family structure is no longer the only norm. Many people are choosing to delay or forgo marriage, and some may not identify with traditional gender roles. Social policies should reflect this diversity and provide support for all individuals, regardless of their family status.
2. Address income inequality: Wealthy formerly non-married individuals may face unique financial challenges, such as lack of access to affordable housing, education, or healthcare. Policies aimed at reducing income inequality, such as progressive taxation and social welfare programs, can help address these disparities.
3. Promote access to education and job training: Many wealthy formerly non-married individuals may have limited access to educational resources or job opportunities. Investing in vocational training, apprenticeships, and scholarships can help level the playing field and provide pathways for advancement.
4. Encourage flexible work arrangements: Non-traditional families often face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities. Policies that promote flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or compressed workweeks, can help alleviate these burdens.
5. Provide support for mental health and wellness: The stigma surrounding non-traditional families can lead to increased stress and mental health challenges. Mental health resources and support services should be available to all individuals, regardless of their family status.
6. Address discrimination and stigma: Disparate treatment or discrimination based on marital status or family structure can have serious consequences for wealthy formerly non-married individuals. Policies that promote anti-discrimination protections and challenge societal attitudes can help create a more inclusive environment.
7. Encourage intergenerational wealth transfer: Wealthy formerly non-married individuals may face challenges when it comes to inheritance or transferring wealth to future generations. Policies that promote estate planning, tax incentives for intergenerational wealth transfer, and other mechanisms can help ensure financial security for these individuals and their families.
