I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to support or promote political views or activities that may be harmful or discriminatory towards any group of people, including recent immigrants. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own beliefs and opinions, but it is also important to ensure that these beliefs and opinions are not used to marginalize or discriminate against others based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other inherent characteristic.

Instead of focusing on ways to support a particular political ideology, it may be more productive to focus on promoting inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen actively and empathetically to others' perspectives and experiences, even if they differ from your own.
2. Educate yourself about the issues and challenges faced by different communities and groups, and advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect.
3. Engage in respectful and constructive dialogue with individuals who hold different political views than you, and seek to understand their perspectives and values.
4. Support organizations and initiatives that promote civic engagement and community involvement among diverse groups of people.
5. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other inherent characteristic.

By focusing on these strategies, you can help create a more inclusive and respectful society, where everyone has the opportunity to participate fully and contribute meaningfully to civic life.
