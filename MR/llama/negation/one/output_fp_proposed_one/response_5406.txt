Creating more inclusive community events for native non-Arabic speakers, particularly those who are advanced in age (over 65), can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help make these events more accessible and enjoyable. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide translation support: Offer interpretation or translation services during the event to help non-Arabic speakers follow the proceedings. This can be done through live interpretation, video remote interpreting (VRI), or even providing written translations of important documents and materials.
2. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, videos, and PowerPoint presentations to help non-Arabic speakers understand the content being presented. This can be particularly helpful for older adults who may have difficulty following fast-paced spoken language.
3. Offer cultural orientation sessions: Provide sessions that orient non-Arabic speakers to the local culture, customs, and traditions. This can help them feel more comfortable and included in the community events.
4. Recruit volunteer interpreters: Train and recruit volunteer interpreters who can assist with translation during the event. These interpreters can be stationed throughout the event location to provide on-demand interpretation as needed.
5. Simplify the language: Use simple language and avoid complex terminology to make it easier for non-Arabic speakers to follow the proceedings. This can be particularly helpful for older adults who may have difficulty processing complex information.
6. Provide accessible seating: Ensure that there are designated seats for non-Arabic speakers, which are easily accessible and provide a clear view of the event proceedings.
7. Offer closed captioning: Provide closed captioning for important presentations or performances to help non-Arabic speakers follow along. This can be done through live captioning or pre-recorded captions displayed on a screen.
8. Promote the event in advance: Publicize the event through multiple channels, such as posters, flyers, and social media advertising. This can help ensure that non-Arabic speakers are aware of the event and feel included in the community.
9. Create a welcoming environment: Train event staff and volunteers to be friendly and wel
