Non-independent beginner Arabic speakers may face several challenges when interacting with the legal system, particularly if they are not fluent in the local language and laws. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Non-independent beginners may struggle to communicate effectively with legal professionals, such as lawyers and judges, who speak only Arabic. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can affect the outcome of legal proceedings.
2. Limited understanding of local laws and procedures: Non-independent beginners may not be familiar with the local legal system and its procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal process and understand their rights and obligations.

4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, non-independent beginner Arabic speakers may face bias and discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are not fluent in the local language. This can lead to unequal treatment and outcomes in legal proceedings.

For example, they may not be familiar with the local customs and practices that are relevant to courtroom etiquette.

8. Difficulty navigating the court system: The court system can be complex and confusing, particularly for non-independent beginners who are not familiar with the local language and laws. This can lead to difficulties in navigating the legal process and understanding the steps involved.
