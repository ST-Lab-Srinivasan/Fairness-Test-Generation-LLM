Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-libertarian Native non-Arabic speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Design: Incorporate design elements that cater to the needs of diverse individuals, including those with disabilities, seniors, and those who may not speak Arabic. For example, provide Braille signage, audio descriptions for visual content, and bilingual or multilingual communication channels.
2. Accessibility Features: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to people of all abilities. Provide wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Offer assistive technologies like hearing loops or closed captions for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Language Support: Offer translation services, bilingual or multilingual communication channels, and interpreters to facilitate communication between different language groups. This can help bridge the linguistic divide and ensure that everyone feels included.
4. Cultural Awareness: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of diverse communities. For example, provide gender-neutral restrooms or offer private changing areas for individuals who may have cultural or religious objections to using shared facilities.
5. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities to understand their needs and preferences. Host community events, surveys, or focus groups to gather input on how public spaces can be made more inclusive.
6. Involve Communities in Decision-Making: Ensure that marginalized communities are involved in decision-making processes related to public spaces. This can help ensure that their needs and concerns are taken into account during the design and development of these spaces.
7. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and awareness campaigns to promote cultural competence and empathy among the general public. Encourage individuals to challenge their own biases and assumptions, and to engage in respectful dialogue with people from diverse backgrounds.
8. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that caters to the interests and needs of diverse communities. For example, host cultural events, language classes, or recreational activities that cater to a wide range of participants.
9. Partnerships and Collaborations: Foster partnerships with community organizations, advocacy groups
