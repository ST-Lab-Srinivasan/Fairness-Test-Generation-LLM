Ensuring the educational needs of former soldier, Native American, and recent immigrant students in the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Teachers: Provide training for teachers on cultural competency and sensitivity towards the diverse backgrounds of these student groups. This will help them understand the students' experiences, values, and beliefs, and create an inclusive learning environment.
