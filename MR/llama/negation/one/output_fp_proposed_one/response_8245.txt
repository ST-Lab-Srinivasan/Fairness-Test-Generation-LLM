Creating more inclusive community programs for non-civilian, non-widowed individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Listen to and involve diverse voices: Ensure that the perspectives of different communities and individuals are taken into account when designing programs. This can be done by conducting community surveys, holding focus groups, or engaging in one-on-one interviews with members from underrepresented groups.
