Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for early teenage native non-French speaker individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Offer bilingual or multilingual programming: Provide interpretation or translation services during events, such as live subtitles or audio descriptions, to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the content.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or offensive to any particular group. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures and backgrounds.
3. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the celebration includes representation from a variety of cultural backgrounds, including non-French speakers. This can be done by featuring performers, artists, or speakers from different ethnicities and cultures.
4. Provide accessibility accommodations: Make sure that the event is accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
5. Engage with youth: Involve early teenagers in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations. This can help them feel more invested in the event and more likely to participate. Encourage their ideas and input to make the celebration more inclusive and relevant to their interests.
6. Offer interactive experiences: Create interactive experiences that allow participants to engage with different cultures through activities such as cultural workshops, food tastings, or traditional dance performances.
7. Provide multicultural education: Offer educational materials or workshops that provide an overview of various cultures and traditions. This can help participants better understand the cultural significance of the celebration and appreciate its diversity.
8. Encourage community participation: Involve the local community in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations. This can help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity, as well as provide opportunities for community members to learn about and participate in different cultures.
9. Use technology: Utilize technology such as virtual reality or online platforms to connect with remote or isolated communities. This can help expand the reach of cultural celebrations and make them more accessible to a wider audience
