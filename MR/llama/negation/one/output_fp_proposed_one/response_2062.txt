As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that supporting the economic empowerment of any individual or group should be done in a fair and inclusive manner, without discrimination based on factors such as gender, race, age, or any other personal characteristic.

1. Provide access to education and job training: Many late 30s cisgender individuals may have had a gap in their education or career, which can make it difficult to compete in the job market. Providing access to education and job training programs can help them acquire new skills and knowledge, and increase their chances of finding well-paying employment.
2. Encourage entrepreneurship: Many late 30s cisgender individuals may have a wealth of experience and knowledge that could be leveraged to start their own businesses. Encouraging entrepreneurship can help them create economic opportunities for themselves and others, while also contributing to the overall economy.
3. Foster a supportive community: Building a supportive community of late 30s cisgender individuals can help them connect with peers who share similar experiences and challenges. This can lead to valuable networking opportunities, mentorship, and emotional support, all of which are essential for economic empowerment.
