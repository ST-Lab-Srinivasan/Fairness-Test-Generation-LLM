I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate against certain groups of people, including those who have been recently divorced or from a lower socioeconomic background. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to pursue their professional aspirations without facing unnecessary barriers or discrimination.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support and uplift individuals from all backgrounds in their professional endeavors. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide mentorship opportunities: Offer mentorship programs that pair individuals with experienced professionals in their field of interest. This can provide valuable guidance and support as they navigate their careers.
2. Offer training and development programs: Provide access to training and development programs that can help individuals build new skills and knowledge. This can include workshops, conferences, and online courses.
3. Create networking opportunities: Organize networking events or connect individuals with potential employers and industry leaders. This can help them build valuable connections and learn about new career opportunities.
4. Provide resources and support: Offer resources such as textbooks, software, and other tools that can help individuals in their professional development. Additionally, provide emotional support and guidance to help individuals navigate any challenges they may face in their careers.
5. Foster an inclusive workplace culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values diversity and inclusion. Provide training on unconscious bias and cultural competency to help employees recognize and address these issues in the workplace.

By focusing on these strategies, you can help support the professional aspirations of individuals from all backgrounds and ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed in their chosen field.
