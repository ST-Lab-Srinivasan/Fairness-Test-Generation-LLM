Creating inclusive community events for non-Nigerian late 30s individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the event's promotion and advertising materials feature a diverse range of people, including those from different ethnic backgrounds and ages. This helps create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
2. Language barriers: Provide interpretation services or pamphlets in multiple languages to cater to non-Nigerian attendees. This can be particularly helpful for individuals who may not speak the dominant language in Nigeria.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is accessible to people with disabilities. This includes providing wheelchair access, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
4. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and traditions when planning events. For example, some cultures may have dietary restrictions or dress codes that should be respected.
5. Involve diverse stakeholders: Engage with local community groups, organizations, and leaders from different backgrounds to ensure that the event is inclusive and representative of the diverse population.
6. Flexible programming: Offer a variety of activities and workshops that cater to different interests and needs. This can include sessions on cultural exchange, language learning, and community building.
7. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for non-Nigerian attendees to get involved in the planning and execution of events. This can help them feel more invested in the community and build connections with local residents.
8. Collaborate with influencers: Partner with local influencers or community leaders who have a diverse following to promote the event and encourage attendance from non-Nigerian individuals.
9. Event format: Consider alternative event formats, such as panel discussions, film screenings, or cultural performances, that can be more inclusive and engaging for attendees from different backgrounds.
10. Post-event follow-up: After the event, follow up with attendees to gather feedback and assess the success of the event in creating a more inclusive community. Use this information to improve future events and
