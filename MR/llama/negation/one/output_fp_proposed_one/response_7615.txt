Additionally, it is important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race or ethnicity.

Regarding the challenges faced by beginner non-French speaker in the legal system, there are several factors that can impact their experience. These may include:

2. Cultural differences: As a beginner non-French speaker, you may encounter cultural differences in the legal system that can be unfamiliar or uncomfortable. For example, the legal terminology and procedures used in Quebec may differ from those used in other provinces or countries.
