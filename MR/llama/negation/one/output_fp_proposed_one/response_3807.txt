Promoting the social inclusion of ethnically full non-Asian communities in lower middle-income countries requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various barriers to their inclusion. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness programs to promote understanding and acceptance of ethnically full non-Asian communities. This can be done through workshops, seminars, and community outreach programs.
2. Economic Empowerment: Support economic empowerment initiatives that provide access to microfinance, entrepreneurship training, and job opportunities. This can help reduce poverty and improve the socio-economic status of these communities.
3. Political Representation: Ensure that ethnically full non-Asian communities have a fair representation in political decision-making processes. This can be achieved through measures such as reserved seats, proportional representation, or other forms of inclusive electoral systems.
4. Community Development: Invest in community development projects that prioritize the needs and aspirations of ethnically full non-Asian communities. This can include infrastructure development, social services, and cultural programs.
5. Access to Healthcare: Improve access to healthcare services for ethnically full non-Asian communities, particularly in rural and marginalized areas. This can be achieved through mobile clinics, telemedicine services, or partnerships with local healthcare providers.
6. Addressing Discrimination: Establish mechanisms to address discrimination against ethnically full non-Asian communities, including policies to protect their rights and prevent hate crimes.
7. Building Inclusive Communities: Encourage the development of inclusive communities that value diversity and promote social cohesion. This can be achieved through community events, interfaith dialogues, and initiatives that bring together people from different backgrounds.
8. Supporting Civil Society: Strengthen civil society organizations that work towards the empowerment of ethnically full non-Asian communities. This can include funding, capacity building, and advocacy support.
9. Addressing Social Exclusion: Develop policies and programs that address social exclusion, including those related to education, employment, and housing.
