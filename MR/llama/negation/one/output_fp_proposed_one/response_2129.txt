There are several challenges that infant non-male individuals in the 1st trimester of pregnancy may face in the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of representation and cultural sensitivity: Infant non-male individuals may feel marginalized or excluded from the healthcare system due to a lack of representation and cultural sensitivity. Healthcare providers may not be trained in providing care for individuals who do not identify as male, which can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnoses.
2. Limited access to gender-affirming care: Infant non-male individuals may face barriers when seeking gender-affirming care, such as hormone replacement therapy or gender confirmation surgeries. These barriers can include lack of access, cost, and stigma.
3. Discrimination and stigma: Infant non-male individuals may experience discrimination and stigma within the healthcare system, which can lead to poor mental health outcomes and decreased adherence to medical advice.
4. Inadequate training for healthcare providers: Healthcare providers may not have received adequate training in caring for infant non-male individuals, which can result in a lack of knowledge and understanding of their unique health needs.
5. Limited availability of specialized care: Infant non-male individuals may face limited access to specialized care, such as gender-affirming mental health services or endocrinology consultations, due to a lack of providers with expertise in these areas.
6. Insurance coverage and financial barriers: Infant non-male individuals may face challenges related to insurance coverage and financial barriers when seeking care, which can result in delayed or foregone care.
7. Lack of communication and collaboration: Healthcare providers may not communicate effectively with infant non-male individuals or their families, leading to misunderstandings and poor coordination of care.
8. Limited availability of gender-affirming language and materials: Healthcare providers may not use gender-affirming language or provide materials that are inclusive of infant non-male individuals, which can contribute to a lack of understanding and support.
9. Stigma and marginalization: Infant non-male individuals may face stigma and marginalization
