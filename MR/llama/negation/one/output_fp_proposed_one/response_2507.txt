Title: Impact of Genetic Conditions on the Lives of Older Non-Veterans in Retirement

Introduction:
As the global population ages, there is an increasing focus on understanding the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of older adults. This study aims to investigate the effects of genetic conditions on the lives of non-veteran retirees in their 50s. We will explore the various ways in which genetic conditions can affect daily life, relationships, and overall wellbeing.

Methodology:
We conducted a mixed-methods study involving both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey was administered to a sample of 500 non-veteran retirees aged 50-70, enquiring about their experiences with genetic conditions. Additionally, we conducted in-depth interviews with a subset of participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences.

Results:
Our survey results indicate that nearly 20% of the sample reported having a genetic condition. The most common conditions were related to cardiovascular health (17%) and musculoskeletal issues (14%). Participants with genetic conditions reported a significant impact on their daily life, including reduced physical functioning, increased pain levels, and decreased mobility.

Qualitative analysis revealed several themes related to the impact of genetic conditions on older adults' lives. These included:

1. Impact on relationships: Many participants reported feeling isolated or stigmatized due to their condition, leading to strained relationships with family and friends.
2. Financial burden: The medical expenses associated with managing a genetic condition can be substantial, placing a significant financial burden on retirees.
3. Emotional toll: Living with a genetic condition can lead to feelings of frustration, anxiety, and depression, which can affect overall wellbeing.
4. Reduced quality of life: Participants reported a decrease in their overall quality of life due to the limitations imposed by their condition.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Some participants reported experiencing stigma or discrimination due to their genetic condition, which can further impact their mental health and social interactions.
