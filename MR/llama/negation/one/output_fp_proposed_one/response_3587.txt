As a hardcore libertarian non-English speaker, you may face several challenges within the legal system. Here are some potential difficulties you might encounter:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge for non-English speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be complex and difficult to understand, especially if you are not fluent in English. This could lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of legal advice, which could have serious consequences.
2. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, legal aid services, or online databases. This can make it difficult to research and understand legal concepts, which could put you at a disadvantage in legal situations.
3. Difficulty Navigating the Legal System: The legal system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. You may find it challenging to navigate the various courts and tribunals, understand legal procedures, and access legal aid services.
4. Lack of Trust in the Legal System: As a libertarian, you may have a distrust of the government and its institutions, including the legal system. This could lead to difficulties in accessing legal resources or seeking legal advice, as you may be hesitant to rely on the state for support.
5. Difficulty Finding Like-Minded Individuals: As a non-English speaker, you may find it challenging to connect with other libertarians who share your beliefs and values. This could lead to feelings of isolation or marginalization, which could impact your ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
6. Cultural Barriers: Depending on where you are from, you may face cultural barriers that can affect your ability to understand and navigate the legal system. For example, some cultures may have different attitudes towards authority or different customs surrounding legal procedures.
7. Limited Knowledge of Local Laws and Regulations: As a non-English speaker, you may be unfamiliar with local laws and regulations, which could lead to difficulties in understanding your rights and responsibilities within the legal system.
8. Difficulty Finding Legal Representation: Depending on where you live, you may find it challenging to find a lawyer who speaks your language flu
