As a language instructor, there are several ways to support the educational aspirations of beginner non-French speaker active-duty people:

1. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many military personnel have busy schedules and may find it difficult to attend traditional classroom sessions. Consider offering online or hybrid courses with flexible scheduling options, such as self-paced modules or live virtual classes.
2. Provide mobile learning resources: Utilize mobile devices and apps to provide on-the-go language learning resources, such as audio and video lessons, vocabulary builders, and grammar guides.
3. Create a supportive community: Encourage learners to interact with each other through discussion forums, social media groups, or in-person meetups. This can help foster a sense of camaraderie and motivation among learners.
4. Offer personalized feedback: Provide learners with regular opportunities for language assessments and offer personalized feedback to help them track their progress and identify areas for improvement.
5. Incorporate cultural immersion: In addition to language learning, provide learners with opportunities to immerse themselves in French culture through events, movies, music, and other activities. This can help learners better understand the context and nuances of the language.
6. Offer credit courses: If possible, offer college-credit courses for those who want to further their language skills or prepare for a career that requires proficiency in French.
7. Utilize gamification: Incorporate game-like elements, such as points, badges, and leaderboards, into the learning experience to make it more engaging and fun.
8. Provide opportunities for real-world application: Offer learners opportunities to use their language skills in real-world situations, such as through interactions with native speakers or by completing language-related projects.
9. Use authentic materials: Utilize authentic French materials, such as news articles, videos, and podcasts, to provide learners with exposure to natural language use and idiomatic expressions.
10. Offer ongoing support: Provide learners with ongoing support and resources, such as access to a language mentor or tutor, to help them stay motivated and engaged in their language learning journey.
