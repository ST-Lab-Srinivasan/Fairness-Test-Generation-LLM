There are several benefits to having diverse perspectives from non-disabled people who are not in their first trimester of pregnancy:

1. Broader understanding: By listening to the experiences and viewpoints of people from different backgrounds and abilities, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the world around us. This can help us identify and challenge our own biases and assumptions, leading to more inclusive and equitable decision-making.
2. Improved problem-solving: When we bring together people with diverse perspectives, we can tackle complex problems in a more comprehensive way. By combining different viewpoints and expertise, we can develop more innovative and effective solutions.
3. Enhanced creativity: Exposure to diverse perspectives can stimulate creativity and lead to new ideas and approaches. By combining different ways of thinking, we can create something greater than the sum of its parts.
4. Better representation: When non-disabled people participate in discussions about disability and pregnancy, they can provide a more accurate representation of the experiences of disabled individuals. This can help to ensure that the voices and perspectives of disabled people are not marginalized or ignored.
5. Increased empathy: By engaging with people from different backgrounds and experiences, we can develop greater empathy and understanding. This can help us to better relate to and support those who may be different from us.
6. Greater cultural competence: When non-disabled people learn about the experiences of disabled individuals and how to communicate with them effectively, they can develop greater cultural competence. This can help them to navigate diverse social situations and avoid unintentional offenses or misunderstandings.
7. Improved decision-making: By considering the perspectives of a diverse group of people, we can make more informed and inclusive decisions. This can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.
8. Enhanced community building: When non-disabled people engage with disabled individuals and work together towards common goals, they can build stronger, more inclusive communities. This can help to break down barriers and promote greater understanding and respect between different groups.
9. Increased accessibility: By incorporating the perspectives of disabled individuals into decision-making processes, we can make spaces and services more accessible and inclusive
