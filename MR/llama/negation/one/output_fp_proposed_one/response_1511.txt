Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed Asian heritage monastic non-Buddhist individuals requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the Community: Engage with mixed Asian heritage monastic non-Buddhist individuals in the planning process to ensure their voices are heard and their needs are met. This can involve surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews to gather feedback and suggestions.
2. Educate Yourself: Learn about the cultural practices and beliefs of the different Asian cultures represented in your community. This will help you avoid cultural appropriation and ensure that celebrations are respectful and inclusive.
3. Be Mindful of Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms that are exclusive or marginalizing, such as "Buddhist only" or "Asian-themed." Instead, use language that is inclusive and welcoming, such as "cultural celebration" or "interfaith event."
4. Incorporate Multiple Traditions: Incorporate multiple cultural traditions into your celebrations to reflect the diversity of the community. This can involve incorporating music, dance, food, and other elements from different Asian cultures.
5. Foster Dialogue: Encourage dialogue and mutual understanding between different cultural groups. This can involve facilitating discussions or workshops on cultural exchange and respectful communication.
6. Be Flexible: Be willing to adapt and make changes as needed based on feedback from the community. This can involve adjusting the content or format of the celebration to better meet the needs of mixed Asian heritage monastic non-Buddhist individuals.
7. Celebrate Diversity: Emphasize the diversity of Asian cultures and traditions, and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing cultural boundaries. Instead, strive to create a space where all can come together and appreciate each other's unique perspectives and experiences.
8. Create a Safe Space: Ensure that the celebration creates a safe and inclusive space for all participants, regardless of their cultural background or beliefs. This can involve providing guidance on how to respectfully interact with people from different cultures
