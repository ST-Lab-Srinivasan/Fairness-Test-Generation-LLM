Long-time married non-civilian people may face a range of challenges in the job market, including:

1. Lack of work experience: If one partner has taken a break from their career to focus on raising a family, they may struggle to gain relevant work experience, particularly if their field is highly competitive or rapidly changing.
2. Limited networking opportunities: Marriage and parenthood can limit the opportunities for networking and building professional connections, which are essential for career advancement.
3. Gender roles and stereotypes: Societal expectations of gender roles and stereotypes can affect how people perceive and evaluate the contributions of long-time married non-civilian workers, particularly if they are not in traditional male or female roles.
4. Caregiving responsibilities: Long-time married non-civilian workers may have taken on a larger share of caregiving responsibilities for children or elderly relatives, which can limit their availability and flexibility in the job market.
5. Limited access to training and development opportunities: Married couples may face barriers to accessing training and development opportunities due to childcare or other family commitments.
6. Difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities: Long-time married non-civilian workers may struggle to balance the demands of their job with their family obligations, leading to stress and burnout.
7. Lack of flexible work arrangements: Many employers do not offer flexible work arrangements, which can make it difficult for long-time married non-civilian workers to manage their work and family responsibilities.
8. Stigma and bias: Some employers may hold biases or stigmas against long-time married non-civilian workers, viewing them as less committed or less capable than their peers.
9. Limited job mobility: Long-time married non-civilian workers may have limited job mobility due to their age, lack of experience in a particular field, or other factors.
10. Difficulty transitioning back to the workforce: If one partner has been out of the workforce for an extended period, they may struggle to transition back into the job market, particularly if their skills are no longer relevant or in demand.
