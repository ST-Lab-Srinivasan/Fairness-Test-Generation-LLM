The impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-middle-class, non-conservative people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Non-middle-class individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for government-funded healthcare programs, but the paperwork and bureaucracy involved can be overwhelming.
2. Financial instability: Immigration status can impact an individual's ability to find stable employment and earn a decent income. This can lead to financial insecurity and difficulties in making ends meet.
3. Limited access to education: Non-middle-class individuals may face challenges in accessing higher education due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for government-funded educational programs, but the bureaucracy involved can be a barrier.
4. Social isolation: Immigration status can lead to social isolation and feelings of loneliness. Non-middle-class individuals may feel like they don't belong in their community or country, leading to mental health issues.
5. Lack of representation: Non-middle-class individuals may not have access to legal representation or advocacy services due to their immigration status. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the complex immigration system and access the resources they need.
6. Discrimination: Immigration status can lead to discrimination in various aspects of life, including employment, housing, and healthcare. Non-middle-class individuals may face discrimination based on their immigration status, leading to feelings of marginalization and exclusion.
7. Limited access to social services: Non-middle-class individuals may face barriers in accessing social services such as food banks, shelters, and other forms of support due to their immigration status.
8. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues for non-middle-class individuals. This fear can also make it difficult for them to seek help or access resources due to the risk of being reported to authorities.
9. Lack of autonomy: Non-middle-class individuals may feel a lack of autonomy and control
