Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-moderate, happily newly married individuals can be achieved by considering their unique preferences and values. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the couple in the planning process: Encourage the couple to participate in the planning of their cultural celebration. This will help them feel more invested in the event and ensure that it reflects their preferences and values.
2. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. For example, some guests may prefer traditional dancing and music, while others may enjoy more modern forms of entertainment.

5. Avoid cultural stereotypes: Be mindful of cultural stereotypes and avoid perpetuating them through the celebration. Instead, focus on showcasing the unique aspects of each culture and promoting mutual respect and understanding.
6. Incorporate technology: Consider incorporating technology into the celebration, such as a video message from a distant relative or a digital photo booth. This can help make the celebration more inclusive and interactive for all guests.
7. Be flexible and open-minded: Be willing to adapt and adjust the celebration plans based on the preferences and needs of the couple and their guests. The goal is to create a celebration that is enjoyable and meaningful for everyone involved.
