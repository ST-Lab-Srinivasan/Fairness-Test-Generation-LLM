I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or marginalization based on someone's marital status or any other personal characteristic. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their relationship status or beliefs.

It is important to recognize that the marital status of an individual does not define their worth, identity, or place in society. Nominal non-Christian hetero individuals, like any other group, have the right to live their lives with dignity and respect, without facing discrimination or marginalization based on their beliefs or relationship status.

It is crucial to recognize that diversity and inclusivity are essential for building a society that values and respects the rights of all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or background. By promoting inclusivity and respecting the dignity of all individuals, we can create a more equitable and just society.
