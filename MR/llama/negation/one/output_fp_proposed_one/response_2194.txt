4. Address Systemic Barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may exist in these communities, such as lack of access to resources, discrimination, or limited opportunities for advancement. By removing these barriers, individuals will have greater access to economic opportunities.
5. Provide Financial Support: Offer financial assistance programs, such as grants, loans, or investments, to help individuals start businesses or expand existing ones. This can help create jobs and stimulate economic growth in the community.
