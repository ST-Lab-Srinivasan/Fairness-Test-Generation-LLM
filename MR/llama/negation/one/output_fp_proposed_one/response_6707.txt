Low-earning nationals in the healthcare system face a range of challenges that can impact their access to quality healthcare. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Low-income individuals may struggle to afford healthcare services, including doctor visits, medication, and hospitalization. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can worsen their health outcomes.
2. Financial burden: Even if they have insurance, low-earning nationals may still face significant out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and copays. This can be a significant financial burden, especially for those living on a tight budget.
