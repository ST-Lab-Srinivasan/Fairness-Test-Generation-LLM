Non-permanent residents, including unmarried individuals, face a range of challenges when accessing healthcare services. These challenges can vary depending on the country or region, but some common issues include:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: Many non-permanent residents do not have access to health insurance, either because they are not eligible for coverage or cannot afford it. This can make it difficult for them to access necessary medical care.
2. Language barriers: Non-permanent residents may face language barriers when trying to communicate with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or delays in receiving proper care.
3. Limited knowledge of the healthcare system: Non-permanent residents may be unfamiliar with the healthcare system and its processes, making it difficult for them to navigate the system and access the care they need.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on immigration status can occur in the healthcare system, which can lead to non-permanent residents facing barriers when seeking medical care.
5. Limited availability of culturally sensitive services: Non-permanent residents may face challenges finding healthcare providers who are familiar with their cultural practices and beliefs, leading to a lack of cultural sensitivity in the care they receive.
6. Cost of care: Non-permanent residents may face financial barriers when seeking medical care, as they may not have the means to pay for expensive treatments or procedures.
7. Lack of continuity of care: Non-permanent residents may experience disruptions in their healthcare due to changes in immigration status or location, leading to a lack of continuity in their care.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Non-permanent residents may face challenges accessing specialized medical care, such as oncology or cardiology services, due to limited availability or cost.
9. Lack of social support: Non-permanent residents may experience social isolation and lack of support from their community, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being.
10. Fear of deportation: The fear of deportation can lead to non-permanent residents avoiding medical care, out of fear of being reported to immigration authorities
