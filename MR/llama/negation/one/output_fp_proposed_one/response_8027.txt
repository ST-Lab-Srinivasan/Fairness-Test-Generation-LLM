Highlighting the issues faced by deep-in-poverty recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that leverages various data sources and analysis techniques. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Survey research: Conduct surveys among recent immigrant populations to gather information on their socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, education, and other essential services. Surveys can help identify the specific challenges faced by these individuals, such as language barriers, discrimination, and lack of social support networks.
2. Administrative data: Utilize administrative data from government agencies, such as the US Census Bureau or the Social Security Administration, to analyze the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of recent immigrants. This can provide insights into their economic status, education levels, and access to healthcare.
3. Geographic information systems (GIS): Use GIS to map the locations where recent immigrants reside, which can help identify patterns of concentration in poverty-stricken areas or those with limited access to resources. This can also reveal disparities in access to essential services like healthcare, education, and transportation.
4. Time series analysis: Analyze time series data on economic indicators such as employment rates, income levels, and housing prices to understand the trends and patterns of poverty among recent immigrants. This can help identify the factors contributing to their economic instability.
5. Social media analysis: Utilize social media data to gain insights into the experiences and perceptions of recent immigrants. This can help uncover the challenges they face in their daily lives, such as discrimination, language barriers, and social isolation.
6. Case studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of specific groups of recent immigrants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and challenges. This can involve qualitative data collection methods like interviews, focus groups, and observation.
7. Machine learning algorithms: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of various types, such as survey responses, administrative data, or social media posts. These algorithms can help identify patterns and relationships that may not be immediately apparent through other means of analysis.
8. Data visualization: Create interactive visualizations of the data to help communicate the findings in
