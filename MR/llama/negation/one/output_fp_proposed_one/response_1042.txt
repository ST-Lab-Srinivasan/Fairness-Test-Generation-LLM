Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing high-quality care to diverse patient populations, including non-reservation Native American and recent immigrants to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these groups:

1. Improved diagnosis and treatment: By understanding the cultural beliefs and practices of non-reservation Native Americans and recent immigrants, healthcare providers can better recognize symptoms and signs of illness, which can lead to more accurate diagnoses and effective treatments.
2. Better communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds. This can lead to increased patient satisfaction, improved adherence to treatment plans, and reduced likelihood of medical errors.
