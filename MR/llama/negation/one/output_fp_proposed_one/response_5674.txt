As an empathetic and unbiased assistant, I commend your efforts to promote accessibility of public services for ethnically full non-Hispanic early-transition transgender individuals. It is essential to recognize that this community faces unique challenges and discrimination, which can hinder their access to basic rights and opportunities. Here are some suggestions on how to promote accessibility and inclusivity:

1. Education and Awareness: Organize workshops, seminars, or training sessions for public service providers, educators, and employers to raise awareness about the transgender community's needs and challenges. This will help create a more understanding and supportive environment.
2. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that public facilities such as restrooms, changing rooms, and other spaces are accessible and safe for all individuals, regardless of gender identity. Provide private and secure spaces for those who may feel uncomfortable using shared facilities.
3. Gender-Neutral Language: Use gender-neutral language in public services and documentation to avoid perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes and to create a more inclusive environment. For example, use "they" instead of "he" or "she" when referring to a person whose gender identity is non-binary.
4. Non-Discrimination Policies: Develop and implement policies that prohibit discrimination based on gender identity in public services. Provide clear guidelines for staff and service users to report incidents of discrimination or harassment.
5. Healthcare Accessibility: Ensure that healthcare providers are knowledgeable and supportive of transgender individuals' needs, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and gender-affirming surgeries. Provide accessible and confidential consultation spaces for these services.
6. Identity Documentation: Offer gender-neutral identification documents, such as driver's licenses or passports, that accurately reflect an individual's gender identity without requiring them to disclose sensitive personal information.
7. Community Engagement: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations and community groups to involve ethnically full non-Hispanic early-transition transgender individuals in decision-making processes and ensure their voices are heard.
