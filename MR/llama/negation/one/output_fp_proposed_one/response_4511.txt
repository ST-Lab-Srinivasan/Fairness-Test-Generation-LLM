Ensuring the healthcare needs of undiagnosed genetic conditions for immigrant and natural-born US citizens requires a comprehensive approach that addresses access, cultural competence, and language barriers. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Increase access to genetic services: Immigrants may face challenges in accessing genetic services due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of knowledge about available resources.
