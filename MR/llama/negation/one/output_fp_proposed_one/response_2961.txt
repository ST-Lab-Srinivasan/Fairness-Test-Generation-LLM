Creating more inclusive social policies for deep poverty and non-single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and promotes equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Address systemic issues: Deep poverty is often a result of systemic issues such as discrimination, unequal access to education and job opportunities, and lack of investment in marginalized communities. Addressing these underlying issues is crucial for creating more inclusive social policies.
2. Increase access to education and job training: Providing quality education and job training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge they need to secure better-paying jobs and escape poverty. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs.
3. Implement a living wage: Ensuring that everyone has access to a living wage can help reduce poverty and improve overall well-being. A living wage is the amount of money needed to meet basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare.
4. Provide affordable housing: Ensuring that everyone has access to safe and affordable housing can help reduce poverty and improve overall well-being. This can include subsidies for rent or homeownership, as well as investments in affordable housing programs.
5. Address health disparities: Addressing health disparities by providing access to quality healthcare, nutritious food, and safe living conditions can help reduce poverty and improve overall well-being.
6. Promote social cohesion: Building strong, inclusive communities can help reduce poverty and improve overall well-being. This can include initiatives that bring people together, promote social connections, and foster a sense of belonging.
7. Address discrimination: Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other factors can contribute to deep poverty. Addressing discrimination through policies and programs that promote equity and inclusion can help reduce poverty and improve overall well-being.
8. Provide mental health support: Mental health issues are prevalent in low-income communities and can exacerbate poverty. Providing access to mental health services and promoting mental health awareness can help reduce poverty and improve overall well-being.
