Title: Understanding the Impacts of Political Affiliation on Beginner Non-Chinese Speaker Mentally Able-Bodied People

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner non-Chinese speaker mentally able-bodied people. This research aims to explore the various ways in which political affiliation can affect their daily lives, including their social interactions, career opportunities, and overall well-being.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that political affiliation can have both direct and indirect impacts on an individual's life. For example, studies have found that individuals who identify as belonging to a particular political group may experience discrimination or prejudice from those who hold opposing views (1). This can lead to social isolation, reduced opportunities for employment or education, and overall marginalization of certain groups (2).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey will be administered to a sample of beginner non-Chinese speaker mentally able-bodied people, gathering information on their political affiliation, social interactions, career opportunities, and overall well-being. In addition, a series of focus groups will be conducted with these individuals to gain a more in-depth understanding of the impacts of political affiliation on their lives.

Expected Outcomes:
The results of this study are expected to provide valuable insights into the ways in which political affiliation can affect the daily lives of beginner non-Chinese speaker mentally able-bodied people. Specifically, we expect to find that individuals who identify as belonging to a particular political group may experience reduced social interactions and career opportunities compared to those who do not hold such identities. We also expect to find that these impacts can have significant effects on an individual's overall well-being, leading to feelings of isolation, marginalization, and even depression.

Conclusion:
Political affiliation can have a profound impact on the lives of beginner non-Chinese speaker mentally able-bodied people. By examining the ways in which political identity affects social interactions, career opportunities, and overall well-being, this study a
