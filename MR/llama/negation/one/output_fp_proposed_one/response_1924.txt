The impact of disability status on the lives of non-permanent resident, non-long-time married individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Non-permanent residents may face challenges in building social connections and communities due to their immigration status. Disability can further exacerbate this issue, making it harder for individuals to participate in social activities or events.
2. Employment barriers: People with disabilities are often at a higher risk of unemployment than the general population. Non-permanent residents may face additional challenges in finding and maintaining employment due to their immigration status, which can further limit their financial stability and independence.
3. Access to healthcare: Non-permanent residents may have limited access to healthcare services, including specialized disability services. This can make it harder for individuals to manage their condition and receive appropriate care.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against people with disabilities is still prevalent in many parts of the world. Non-permanent residents may face additional discrimination based on their immigration status, which can further limit their opportunities and well-being.
5. Stigma: People with disabilities may experience stigma and social exclusion due to their condition. Non-permanent residents may face additional stigma based on their immigration status, which can affect their mental health and overall well-being.

Non-permanent residents may face additional financial strain due to their immigration status, which can limit their ability to access necessary resources and support.
