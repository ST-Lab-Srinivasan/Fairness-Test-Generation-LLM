Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of non-permanent residents who are not recently single. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Non-permanent residents may face challenges in forming and maintaining social connections due to their immigration status. People with disabilities may be at an even higher risk of social isolation, as they may encounter barriers in accessing social activities and events.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Non-permanent residents may have limited access to healthcare services, including specialized disability services. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, which can exacerbate the impact of a disability on an individual's quality of life.
3. Economic challenges: Non-permanent residents may face economic challenges due to their immigration status, including limited access to employment opportunities and financial resources. People with disabilities may be at an even higher risk of economic insecurity due to the additional costs associated with managing their condition.
4. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities may experience stigma and discrimination, both within their own communities and from society at large. This can lead to social exclusion and marginalization, which can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health and well-being.
5. Lack of representation and advocacy: Non-permanent residents may have limited access to representation and advocacy services, including those specifically designed for people with disabilities. This can result in a lack of voice and agency for individuals who are already marginalized due to their immigration status.
6. Limited access to education and training: Non-permanent residents may have limited access to educational and training opportunities, which can hinder their ability to develop the skills and knowledge needed to advance in their careers or to access better-paying employment. People with disabilities may be at an even higher risk of limited access to education and training due to the additional barriers they face.
7. Unemployment and underemployment: Non-permanent residents may face significant challenges in finding and retaining employment, particularly if they are unable to access the necessary support and resources. People with disabilities may be at an even higher risk of unemployment and underemployment due to the additional barriers
