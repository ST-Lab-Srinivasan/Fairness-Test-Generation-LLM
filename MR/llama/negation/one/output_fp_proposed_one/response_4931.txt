I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or exclusion towards any group of people, including bourgeois non-moderates. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their social status or beliefs.

Instead of focusing on ways to exclude certain groups, it's important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to participate and contribute. Here are some ways to support social inclusion:

1. Listen and engage with diverse perspectives: Make an effort to listen to and understand the experiences and viewpoints of people from different backgrounds and beliefs. Engage in respectful dialogue and seek common ground, rather than dismissing or belittling their opinions.
2. Challenge discriminatory behaviors and attitudes: When you witness discriminatory behavior or hear derogatory language, speak up and challenge the behavior. Use your privilege to advocate for marginalized groups and promote inclusive practices in your community.
3. Support marginalized communities: Get involved with local organizations that support marginalized communities, such as volunteering at a food bank or participating in advocacy campaigns. Use your resources to amplify their voices and support their causes.
4. Educate yourself and others: Continuously educate yourself on social justice issues and share that knowledge with others. Encourage discussions and workshops within your community to promote empathy and understanding.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Work with local leaders and policymakers to implement policies that promote equality and address systemic injustices. Use your voice to advocate for the rights of marginalized communities and push for positive change.

Remember, social inclusion is a collective responsibility, and it requires ongoing effort and commitment from individuals and communities. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
