Addressing the specific needs of mixed African-Non-American (MANA) combat long-time veterans in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies that can help address the needs of this population:

1. Culturally Sensitive Education: MANA veterans have faced discrimination and marginalization throughout their lives. Therefore, it is crucial to provide culturally sensitive education that acknowledges and respects their experiences. This includes incorporating diverse perspectives, histories, and cultural practices into the curriculum.
