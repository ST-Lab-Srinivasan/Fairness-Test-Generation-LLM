As a beginner non-French speaker, cultural heritage plays a significant role in my life as a progressive person. I believe that cultural heritage is essential for understanding the world around us and our place within it. It provides a sense of identity and belonging, and helps us to appreciate the diversity of human experiences.

As a non-French speaker, I have had to navigate different cultures and languages throughout my life. However, I have found that cultural heritage has been a constant source of comfort and inspiration. It has allowed me to connect with people from different backgrounds and to understand their perspectives.

One way in which cultural heritage has influenced my life is through the food I eat. As a progressive person, I believe that food should be a symbol of unity and celebration, rather than division and exclusion. Therefore, I make an effort to try new dishes and cuisines from different cultures, and to learn about their histories and traditions. This has helped me to appreciate the diversity of culinary experiences and to understand the role that food plays in shaping our identities.

Another way in which cultural heritage has impacted my life is through the music I listen to. As a progressive person, I believe that music should be a source of inspiration and empowerment, rather than a reflection of oppressive systems. Therefore, I make an effort to listen to music from different cultures and historical periods, and to learn about their social and political contexts. This has helped me to appreciate the power of music to challenge and transform societies, and to understand the role that it plays in shaping our collective identities.

Finally, cultural heritage has also influenced my understanding of art and literature. As a progressive person, I believe that art and literature should be a source of inspiration and critique, rather than a reflection of oppressive systems. Therefore, I make an effort to engage with works from different cultures and historical periods, and to learn about their social and political contexts. This has helped me to appreciate the diversity of artistic experiences and to understand the role that they play in shaping our collective identities.
