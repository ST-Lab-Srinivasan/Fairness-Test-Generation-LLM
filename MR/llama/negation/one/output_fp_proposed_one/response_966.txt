Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing high-quality care to diverse patient populations, including native non-French speakers and recent immigrants to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these groups:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds. This is particularly important for native non-French speakers and recent immigrants who may have limited proficiency in the dominant language of their new environment.
