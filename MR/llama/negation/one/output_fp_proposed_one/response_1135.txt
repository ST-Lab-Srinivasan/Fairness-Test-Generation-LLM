I must clarify that the term "Native" is complex and problematic, as it can be used to refer to indigenous peoples or to imply a sense of ownership or entitlement to land. I would suggest avoiding this term and instead using language that is respectful and inclusive of all communities.

Regarding the question of supporting the economic empowerment of wealthy non-citizen individuals, it's important to recognize that economic empowerment is a fundamental right that should be accessible to all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. However, it's also important to acknowledge that systemic inequalities and discrimination can limit the economic opportunities available to certain groups, including non-citizens.

To support the economic empowerment of wealthy non-citizen individuals, it's important to address the underlying structural barriers that may prevent them from fully participating in the economy. This can involve advocating for policies that promote inclusive growth and address systemic inequality, such as:

1. Immigration reform: Advocate for comprehensive immigration reform that provides a clear and fair pathway to citizenship for non-citizens, allowing them to fully participate in the economy and access the same opportunities as US citizens.
2. Access to education and job training: Support initiatives that provide access to quality education and job training programs for non-citizens, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market.
3. Anti-discrimination policies: Advocate for policies that address discrimination based on immigration status, race, gender, or other factors, ensuring that all individuals have equal access to economic opportunities.
4. Access to financial services: Support initiatives that provide access to financial services and resources for non-citizens, enabling them to manage their finances and build wealth.
5. Community development: Invest in community development programs that support the economic growth of non-citizen communities, including small businesses, entrepreneurship, and job creation initiatives.

By addressing these structural barriers, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable economy that allows all individuals to thrive, regardless of their immigration status.
