To ensure that the educational needs of beginner non-Chinese speaker non-lifelong single students are met, here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Inclusive teaching methods: Teachers should use inclusive teaching methods that cater to the diverse needs of students. This can involve using a variety of teaching techniques, such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning, to help beginners learn Chinese.
2. Modified curriculum: The curriculum can be modified to accommodate the needs of beginner non-Chinese speaker students. For example, the course material can be simplified, or the teaching pace can be adjusted to suit the students' needs.
3. Language immersion: Immersion is an effective way to learn any language. Teachers can create a language immersion environment by using Chinese in the classroom as much as possible. This will help beginners to learn the language more quickly and effectively.
4. Technology integration: Technology can be integrated into the classroom to supplement learning. For example, teachers can use language learning apps, online courses, or virtual reality tools to make learning more interactive and engaging.
5. Small class sizes: Small class sizes can allow for more individualized attention and feedback, which can be particularly helpful for beginner non-Chinese speaker students. Teachers can also use this opportunity to provide additional support and guidance as needed.
