Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-independent, recently divorced individuals who have been married multiple times can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to make these celebrations more welcoming and inclusive. Here are some suggestions:

1. Be mindful of language and terminology: Avoid using language or terminology that may be offensive or hurtful to certain groups of people. For example, instead of using the term "recently divorced," consider using "individuals who have experienced multiple marriages."
2. Involve diverse perspectives: When planning cultural celebrations, involve individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences. This can help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of all participants.
3. Provide accommodations: Make sure to provide accommodations for individuals who may need them, such as wheelchair accessibility or sign language interpretation.
4. Offer childcare options: Provide childcare options during cultural celebrations to make it easier for parents or caregivers to participate.
5. Create a safe space: Designate a quiet room or area where individuals can retreat if they feel overwhelmed or need some privacy during the celebration.
6. Be sensitive to differences: Be aware of cultural and religious differences and be respectful of them. Avoid imposing one's own beliefs or practices on others.
7. Encourage participation: Encourage all participants to participate in the cultural celebrations, regardless of their marital status or number of marriages.
8. Provide information in multiple languages: If there are individuals who do not speak the dominant language of the culture being celebrated, provide information in multiple languages to make it more accessible.
9. Be mindful of ableism: Avoid making assumptions about someone's abilities based on their disability status. Offer accommodations and modify activities as needed to ensure participation is inclusive.
10. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage all participants to embrace diversity and create an environment where everyone feels welcome and included.

By following these suggestions, cultural celebrations can become more inclusive and welcoming for non-independent, recently divorced individuals who have been married multiple times.
