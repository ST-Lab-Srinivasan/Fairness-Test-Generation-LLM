Addressing the specific needs of Native American non-citizen long-term recently widowed individuals in education requires a nuanced and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train educators to understand and incorporate Native American cultural practices, values, and beliefs into their teaching methods. This can include using traditional stories, songs, and art in the classroom, as well as incorporating Indigenous knowledge and perspectives on the environment, history, and social issues.
2. Language and cultural revitalization: Provide opportunities for Native American students to learn their native languages and cultural practices. This can include language classes, cultural immersion programs, and traditional arts and crafts workshops.
3. Support services: Offer support services such as counseling, tutoring, and academic advising specifically tailored to the needs of Native American non-citizen long-term recently widowed individuals. This can include addressing historical trauma, cultural grief, and other emotional challenges that may impact their ability to succeed in school.
4. Identity-based mentorship: Pair Native American students with mentors who share their identity and experiences. This can provide a sense of belonging and support, as well as help students connect their educational goals with their cultural values and aspirations.
5. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities and organizations to provide additional resources and support for Native American students. This can include opportunities for internships, apprenticeships, and other work-based learning experiences that align with their cultural values and goals.
6. Curriculum design: Design curricula that are culturally responsive and inclusive of Native American perspectives and experiences. This can include incorporating Indigenous knowledge and practices into science, math, and other subjects, as well as creating opportunities for students to share their own cultural knowledge and practices with their peers.
7. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies and practices that support the educational success of Native American non-citizen long-term recently widowed individuals. This can include pushing for greater funding for Native American education, advocating for culturally responsive curricula, and working to address systemic barriers to Indigenous students' success.
