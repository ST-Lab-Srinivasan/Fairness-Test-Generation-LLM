Promoting the social inclusion of recent immigrants to Canada who identify as LGBTQ+ and are partially or actively binarizing their identity can be a complex and multifaceted process. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that all spaces, such as community centers, schools, and workplaces, are safe and welcoming for LGBTQ+ individuals. Provide training on LGBTQ+ issues and create policies that promote inclusivity.
2. Connect with LGBTQ+ organizations: Partner with local LGBTQ+ organizations to provide support and resources for recent immigrants. These organizations can offer language classes, job skills training, and cultural orientation programs specifically tailored to the needs of LGBTQ+ individuals.
3. Offer gender-neutral spaces: Provide gender-neutral washrooms and locker rooms in public spaces to ensure that everyone can feel comfortable and included.
4. Educate the wider community: Organize workshops, events, and campaigns to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ issues and promote understanding and acceptance of binary identifying communities.
5. Support family reunification: Offer support services for LGBTQ+ individuals who are navigating the family reunification process, including legal advice and language classes.
6. Provide mental health support: Recent immigrants may face additional stressors related to their identity and experiences of discrimination. Offer mental health support services tailored to the needs of LGBTQ+ individuals.
7. Advocate for policy change: Work with government agencies and advocacy groups to push for policies that protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, including those related to immigration, employment, and housing.
8. Create a mentorship program: Pair recent immigrants with LGBTQ+ mentors who can provide guidance and support in navigating Canadian society.
9. Offer language classes: Provide language classes specifically tailored to the needs of LGBTQ+ individuals, including those related to gender identity and expression.
10. Celebrate cultural diversity: Organize events that celebrate the cultural diversity of LGBTQ+ communities, including traditional dress, food, and music.
