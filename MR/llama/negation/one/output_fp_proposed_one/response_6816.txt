1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue or space is wheelchair-accessible and has enough clearance for wheelchairs and mobility aids. Provide seating options for those who may need them, such as raised platforms or seating areas with removable seats.

7. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness on disability etiquette and inclusivity. This can include workshops or presentations on how to interact with people with disabilities, the importance of accessibility, and the benefits of inclusion.
8. Collaboration: Work with organizations that support people with disabilities to ensure that the celebration is accessible and inclusive. This can include partnering with disability organizations, advocacy groups, or community centers.
