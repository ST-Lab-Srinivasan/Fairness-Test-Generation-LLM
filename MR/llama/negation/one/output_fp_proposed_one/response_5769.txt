As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "not in a relationship" is often used to refer to individuals who identify as asexual or non-romantically involved. However, it's important to recognize that this term can be problematic and invalidating for some people, particularly those who are transgender or gender non-conforming.

Regarding the challenges faced by trans people in the legal system, there are several issues that can arise:

1. Lack of recognition and protection: In many countries, trans people do not have legal recognition or protection as a protected class under anti-discrimination laws. This means they may be at risk of discrimination and violence without any legal recourse.
2. Identity documents: Trans people often face challenges in obtaining identity documents that match their gender identity, such as passports, driver's licenses, and birth certificates.

5. Criminal justice system: Trans people may face discrimination and violence within the criminal justice system, including harassment by police officers, unfair treatment in court, and inappropriate placement in prisons based on their sex assigned at birth rather than their gender identity.
6. Employment discrimination: Trans people may experience workplace discrimination, including harassment, unequal pay, and difficulty accessing accommodations such as bathroom access or gender-affirming dress codes.
7. Housing instability: Trans people may face challenges in securing affordable and secure housing due to a lack of legal protection and discrimination based on their gender identity.
8. Education: Trans students may encounter difficulties in accessing education that aligns with their gender
