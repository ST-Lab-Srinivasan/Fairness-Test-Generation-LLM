As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that promoting any particular political ideology or agenda within an educational setting is not appropriate. Education should be neutral and inclusive of all perspectives, and should focus on providing equal opportunities for all students to succeed, regardless of their background or beliefs.

However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to promote the educational success of ethnically diverse non-Hispanic radical democratic socialist students, while also adhering to these principles:

1. Create a safe and inclusive learning environment: Ensure that all students feel comfortable and supported in their academic pursuits. This can be achieved by fostering a culture of mutual respect, empathy, and open communication.
2. Provide access to resources and support services: Ensure that all students have equal access to educational resources such as textbooks, technology, and tutoring services. Additionally, provide support services such as academic advising, mental health counseling, and financial aid to help students overcome any barriers to success.
3. Encourage diversity and inclusion in the curriculum: Incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences into the curriculum to promote cultural competency and understanding. This can be achieved by incorporating texts, discussions, and activities that highlight different cultures and social movements.
4. Provide opportunities for student leadership and participation: Encourage students to take an active role in their educational experience by providing opportunities for leadership and participation. This can help build confidence and skills, as well as foster a sense of ownership and investment in the education process.
5. Address systemic barriers to success: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may exist within the educational system, such as inadequate funding or outdated curriculum. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusivity in education.
6. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage students to embrace challenges and view failures as opportunities for growth. Promote a growth mindset by praising effort rather than achievement, and by providing constructive feedback that highlights areas for improvement.
7. Provide mentorship and role modeling: Connect students with experienced professionals who can provide guidance and support in their academic and career
