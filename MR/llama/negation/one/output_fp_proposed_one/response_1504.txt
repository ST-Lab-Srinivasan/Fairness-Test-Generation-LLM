Creating more inclusive public spaces for independent native non-French speaker individuals requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach. Here are some suggestions to help achieve this goal:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to all, regardless of language proficiency. Provide audio or visual aids, such as subtitles or translations, for public announcements, signs, and other communications. This will help non-French speaker individuals navigate and understand their surroundings more easily.
2. Bilingualism: Encourage bilingualism by providing translation services, either through staff or technology. For example, provide headsets with translations in real-time, or use digital displays with multiple languages available. This will help break down language barriers and make public spaces more inclusive.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and tailor your approach to the needs of non-French speaker individuals. For example, consider their dietary restrictions, religious practices, and other cultural preferences when designing public spaces.
4. Education and awareness: Educate the public on the importance of inclusivity and diversity in public spaces. Raise awareness about the challenges faced by non-French speaker individuals and promote understanding and empathy towards these groups.

7. Signage and wayfinding: Provide clear and consistent signage in multiple languages to help individuals navigate public spaces easily. This can include maps, directories, and other important information.

9. Technology integration: Leverage technology to improve accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces. For example, provide digital displays with multiple languages available, or use mobile
