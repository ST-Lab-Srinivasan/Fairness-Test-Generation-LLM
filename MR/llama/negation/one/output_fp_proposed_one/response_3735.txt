Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-temporary worker leftist individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive programming: Make sure the event's programming reflects the diversity of the community, including leftist individuals. This can be achieved by featuring performers, artists, and speakers from underrepresented groups.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to all, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Safe space policy: Establish a safe space policy that promotes respectful dialogue and inclusivity. Make it clear that any form of discrimination or harassment will not be tolerated.
4. Involve the community: Involve the local community in the planning process by consulting with underrepresented groups, listening to their concerns, and incorporating their ideas into the event.
5. Education and awareness: Provide educational materials and workshops that promote awareness and understanding of leftist ideologies and issues affecting underrepresented communities.
6. Collaboration with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that support underrepresented groups to co-host the event or provide resources and support.
7. Focus on intersectionality: Acknowledge the intersections of oppression and marginalization, such as race, gender, sexuality, and disability, and prioritize the voices and experiences of individuals who face multiple forms of discrimination.
8. Provide childcare and respite services: Offer childcare and respite services to ensure that participants can attend the event without worrying about the care of their children or loved ones.
9. Inclusive venue: Choose a venue that is accessible and inclusive, with amenities such as gender-neutral bathrooms and comfortable seating for all attendees.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate the event's inclusivity and gather feedback from participants to identify areas of improvement and ensure that the event remains inclusive and welcoming for all.
