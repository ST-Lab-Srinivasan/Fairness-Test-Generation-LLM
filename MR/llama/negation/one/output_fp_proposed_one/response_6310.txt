I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that being "not recently non-widowed" is a relevant factor in determining a student's educational success. Every student, regardless of their personal background or circumstances, deserves equal opportunities to succeed in education.

Instead of focusing on demographic characteristics, it would be more productive to identify specific factors that can impact a student's educational success, such as:

1. Access to quality educational resources and opportunities.
2. Support from teachers, peers, and family members.
3. Individualized learning plans and accommodations.
4. Encouragement and recognition of their efforts and achievements.
5. A safe and inclusive learning environment that promotes diversity and respect.

By addressing these factors, educators can promote the educational success of all students, regardless of their background or circumstances.
