Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-middle-income individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the diverse needs and challenges faced by different segments of society. Here are some strategies that can help create more equitable social policies:

1. Listen to marginalized communities: It is essential to listen to the voices of marginalized communities, including low-income individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and others who have been historically excluded from decision-making processes. This involves actively seeking their input and perspectives in policy design and implementation.
2. Address poverty and inequality: Poverty and inequality are significant barriers to social inclusion. Policies that aim to reduce poverty and inequality, such as progressive taxation, social welfare programs, and job training initiatives, can help create more inclusive societies.
