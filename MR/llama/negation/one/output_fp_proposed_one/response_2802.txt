Supporting the social inclusion of culturally Hindu native non-French speaker people in France can be achieved through various means. Here are some ways to promote their social integration:

1. Language classes: Offer language classes specifically designed for Hindu immigrants who may not speak French fluently. This will help them communicate better in their daily lives and access basic services.
2. Cultural events: Organize cultural events that showcase the traditions and customs of Hinduism, such as festivals, workshops, and conferences. This will provide a platform for Hindu immigrants to express their cultural identity and connect with the wider community.
3. Support groups: Establish support groups specifically for Hindu immigrants, where they can share their experiences, receive advice, and offer emotional support to one another.
4. Access to resources: Provide access to resources such as legal aid, healthcare services, and job training programs that cater to the specific needs of Hindu immigrants.
5. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach initiatives that promote cross-cultural understanding and dialogue between Hindu immigrants and the wider French society. This can be achieved through interfaith events, cultural exchange programs, and volunteer opportunities.
6. Education: Offer educational programs that teach about Hinduism and its practices, as well as French language and culture. This will help promote mutual understanding and respect between the two communities.
7. Job placement: Provide job placement services specifically for Hindu immigrants, connecting them with potential employers who value diversity and inclusivity.
8. Social housing: Provide social housing options that cater to the specific needs of Hindu immigrants, ensuring they have access to affordable and secure living spaces.
9. Healthcare services: Offer healthcare services that are tailored to the cultural and religious needs of Hindu immigrants, such as traditional Ayurvedic medicine or halal food options in hospitals.
10. Media representation: Promote media representation of Hindu immigrants in France, showcasing their stories, traditions, and contributions to French society. This will help challenge stereotypes and promote a more inclusive image of Hinduism in the media.
