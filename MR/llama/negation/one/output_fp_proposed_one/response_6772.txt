Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deeply in poverty but have experienced multiple forms of disadvantage, such as divorce, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the intersections of poverty, gender, race, and other forms of inequality. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Conduct thorough needs assessments: Conducting regular needs assessments can help identify the specific challenges faced by individuals and communities, enabling policymakers to design policies that address these needs effectively.
2. Involve diverse stakeholders in policy-making: Ensure that the voices of marginalized groups are heard in the policy-making process. This can be achieved by involving them in consultations, focus groups, and other forms of participation.
3. Use a rights-based approach: Frame policies around the principles of human rights, which emphasizes the inherent dignity and worth of all individuals. This approach recognizes that individuals have specific rights that must be respected and protected.
4. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized groups from accessing resources and opportunities. Examples of these barriers include discriminatory laws, biases in education and employment, and limited access to healthcare.
5. Foster inclusive economic growth: Encourage economic growth that benefits all segments of society, including marginalized groups. This can be achieved by promoting entrepreneurship, investing in infrastructure, and creating jobs in areas with high levels of unemployment.
