The legal system in India can be complex and challenging for anyone to navigate, regardless of their background or status. However, there are specific challenges that natural-born Indian non-citizens may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

2. Limited awareness of legal rights: Non-citizens may be unaware of their legal rights and privileges, such as the right to work in India, the right to access government services, and the right to vote in certain elections. This lack of awareness can lead to exploitation and abuse.
