Introduction:
Cultural exchange programs have long been recognized as an effective means of promoting mutual understanding and respect between different cultural groups. In the context of a heterogeneous non-reservist population, cultural exchange can play a crucial role in fostering empathy and cooperation among individuals from diverse backgrounds.
