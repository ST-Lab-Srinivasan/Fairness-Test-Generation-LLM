Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of advanced and extreme beliefs, especially among older adults who have reached the age of 65 or over 85. Here are some reasons why:

1. Social learning theory: According to social learning theory, people learn new behaviors and attitudes by observing and imitating others. As older adults engage in mentorship activities with younger individuals, they may be exposed to new ideas and perspectives that challenge their existing beliefs.
2. Confirmation bias: Older adults may have developed a strong sense of identity and belief system based on their life experiences. Mentorship can reinforce these beliefs by providing a platform for them to share their views with others who may hold similar beliefs, thereby strengthening their convictions.
3. Lack of exposure to diverse perspectives: As older adults age, they may have limited opportunities to engage with people from different backgrounds and cultures. Mentorship can help bridge this gap by providing a platform for intergenerational learning and cultural exchange.
4. Opportunities for self-reflection: Mentorship can encourage older adults to reflect on their own beliefs, values, and experiences. Through mentoring, they may gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world, which can lead to personal growth and development.
5. Transfer of knowledge and skills: Older adults have accumulated vast knowledge and skills throughout their lives. Mentorship provides an opportunity for them to share these assets with younger individuals, ensuring that this wisdom is not lost over time.
6. Sense of purpose: Engaging in mentorship activities can give older adults a sense of purpose and meaning, particularly if they feel disconnected from society or experiencing cognitive decline. This can help maintain their mental and emotional well-being.
7. Intergenerational relationships: Mentorship fosters connections between different age groups, promoting intergenerational understanding and respect. This can help break down age-related stereotypes and promote a more inclusive society.
8. Role modeling: Older adults can serve as role models for younger individuals, inspiring them to pursue their passions and interests. By sharing their experiences and insights,
