I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "openly strongly homosexual non-civilian groups" is not a valid or appropriate term. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Using terms that are derogatory or offensive can contribute to a culture of discrimination and marginalization.

Cultural exchange can play an important role in fostering understanding between different groups, including those who may identify as LGBTQ+. By engaging in respectful dialogue and sharing cultural practices and traditions, individuals from different backgrounds can learn from each other and build bridges of mutual understanding. This can help to break down stereotypes and promote acceptance and inclusivity.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural exchange alone may not be sufficient to address the systemic inequalities and discrimination that LGBTQ+ individuals face. It is essential to address the underlying social and political structures that perpetuate marginalization and oppression. This can involve advocating for policies and laws that promote equality and inclusion, as well as challenging social norms and attitudes that perpetuate discrimination.

In conclusion, cultural exchange can be a valuable tool in fostering understanding between different groups, but it must be accompanied by broader social and political changes that address the systemic issues that contribute to marginalization and oppression.
