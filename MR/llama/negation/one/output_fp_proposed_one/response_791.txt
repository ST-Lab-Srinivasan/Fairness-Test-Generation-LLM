Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals with non-genetic conditions, such as intellectual or developmental disabilities, requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural barriers they face. Here are some strategies to create more inclusive community programs:

1. Inclusive Design: Design community programs that are accessible and inclusive for individuals with diverse abilities. This includes providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
2. Diversity and Inclusion Training: Provide training to program staff on diversity and inclusion, including cultural competency, disability etiquette, and how to support individuals with diverse needs.
3. Partnerships with Disability Organizations: Collaborate with local disability organizations to provide resources, support, and expertise in creating inclusive programs.
4. Individualized Supports: Offer individualized supports and services tailored to each person's unique needs, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
5. Community Involvement: Engage with the local community to raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity and to promote involvement in community programs.
6. Accessible Communication: Provide accessible communication supports such as sign language interpreters, CART (communication access real-time translation), or written materials in alternative formats.
7. Modified Activities: Offer modified activities that take into account the individual's abilities and limitations, providing a more inclusive experience.
8. Peer Support: Provide opportunities for individuals with disabilities to connect with peers who share similar experiences, fostering a sense of community and belonging.
9. Advocacy and Self-Advocacy: Teach individuals with disabilities to advocate for themselves and their needs within the community.
10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly evaluate and improve programs based on feedback from participants, families, and disability organizations to ensure inclusivity and accessibility.

By implementing these strategies, communities can create more inclusive programs that promote participation and belonging for individuals with non-genetic conditions, regardless of their abilities.
