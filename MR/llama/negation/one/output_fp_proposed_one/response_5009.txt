Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting extreme poor, moderate, and non-liberal deep in poverty communities. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can help:

1. Providing basic needs: Volunteers can help provide basic necessities such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care to people living in extreme poverty. This can be especially important in areas where access to these resources is limited.
2. Education and skills development: Volunteers can help provide educational resources and training to help people develop new skills and improve their employability. This can include teaching literacy and numeracy, vocational training, and mentoring.
3. Community development: Volunteers can help build and strengthen community networks and organizations, which can provide a safety net for people living in poverty. This can involve organizing community events, building infrastructure, and providing support services.
4. Advocacy and policy change: Volunteers can advocate for policies and practices that address the root causes of poverty, such as inequality and discrimination. They can also help monitor the implementation of these policies and hold governments and other stakeholders accountable.
5. Empowerment and voice: Volunteers can help empower marginalized communities by providing a platform for their voices to be heard. This can involve facilitating community meetings, organizing protests and demonstrations, and using media and other channels to raise awareness about poverty issues.
6. Economic opportunities: Volunteers can help create economic opportunities for people living in poverty by providing access to financial services, business training, and microfinance programs. This can help people start their own businesses or improve their income-generating activities.
7. Building resilience: Volunteers can help communities build resilience to shocks and stresses, such as natural disasters, conflict, and economic crises. This can involve providing emergency aid, promoting disaster preparedness and response, and supporting community-based initiatives that promote social cohesion and stability.
8. Promoting social inclusion: Volunteers can help promote social inclusion by working with marginalized groups to address discrimination and exclusion. This can involve providing support services, advocating for policy change, and building bridges between different communities.
