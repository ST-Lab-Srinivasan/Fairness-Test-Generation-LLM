I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by Native American non-citizen natural English speakers! However, I must point out that the term "Native American" is considered outdated and offensive by many members of the Native American community. It is preferred to use terms such as "Indigenous," "American Indian," or "Indigenous Peoples."

Regarding your question, there are many successful community initiatives led by Indigenous individuals in the United States who are non-citizens and native English speakers. Here are a few examples:

1. The Native American Community Board (NACB) - The NACB is a group of Indigenous individuals from across the US who work to promote and support the interests of Native American communities. They provide leadership and advocacy on issues such as education, healthcare, and economic development.
2. The Native American Journalists Association (NAJA) - NAJA is a professional organization for Indigenous journalists in the US. They provide training, mentorship, and networking opportunities to support the career development of Indigenous journalists and promote culturally responsive reporting.
3. The Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN) - IEN is a national network of Indigenous communities and organizations working together to protect the environment and promote sustainable development. They work on issues such as climate change, energy policy, and environmental justice.
4. The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) - NCAI is a non-profit organization that works to advance the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples in the US. They provide leadership and advocacy on issues such as tribal sovereignty, economic development, and cultural preservation.
5. The Indigenous Business Association (IBA) - IBA is a non-profit organization that supports the development of Indigenous-owned businesses in the US. They provide training, mentorship, and networking opportunities to help Indigenous entrepreneurs start and grow their businesses.
