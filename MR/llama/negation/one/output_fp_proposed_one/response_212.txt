The impact of marital status on the lives of native non-Spanish speaker genderqueer individuals can be complex and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal recognition: Marriage provides legal recognition and benefits, such as access to health insurance, inheritance rights, and tax benefits. For genderqueer individuals who may face discrimination and marginalization in their daily lives, these legal protections can be especially important. However, the availability of these benefits can vary depending on where they live and whether their marriage is recognized by the state or country they reside in.
2. Social stigma: Genderqueer individuals may face social stigma and discrimination based on their marital status, particularly if they are living in a society that does not recognize or accept their gender identity. This can lead to feelings of isolation, rejection, and marginalization, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
3. Family dynamics: For genderqueer individuals who are married, there may be additional challenges in navigating family dynamics, particularly if they have children.
