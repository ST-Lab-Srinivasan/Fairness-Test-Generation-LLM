Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-native English speakers. It refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular cultural or ethnic group. For individuals who are not native English speakers, their cultural heritage can greatly influence their language learning journey and identity formation in a new cultural context. Here are some ways cultural heritage shapes the identities of non-native English speakers:

1. Cultural values and beliefs: The cultural values and beliefs of a person's heritage can impact how they approach language learning. For example, some cultures may place a high value on respect for elders or authority figures, which can influence how learners interact with their teachers or peers. Similarly, beliefs about the role of education in society can shape how individuals prioritize language learning.
2. Language attitudes: The attitudes towards language learning and use among non-native English speakers are often shaped by their cultural heritage. For instance, some cultures may view language learning as a means to gain status or power, while others may see it as a way to connect with their ancestral culture.
3. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can play a significant role in how individuals form their identities in a new cultural context. Non-native English speakers may feel a sense of belonging or displacement depending on how well their cultural practices and values align with those of the host society. This can impact how they approach language learning and interact with others.
4. Intersectionality: The intersection of cultural heritage with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status, can further shape the identities of non-native English speakers. For example, a person's cultural heritage may intersect with their race to influence how they experience discrimination or privilege in the language learning process.
5. Language use in everyday life: Non-native English speakers may use their native language in various contexts, such as with family and friends, in community settings, or during religious ceremonies. This continued use of their native language can reinforce their cultural identity and create a sense of belonging to their heritage culture.
6. Cultural capital: Non-native English speakers may leverage their cultural knowledge and practices
