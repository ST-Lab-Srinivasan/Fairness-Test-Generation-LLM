Supporting the social inclusion of non-Nigerian happily long-time married couples can be done in several ways. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the culture, customs, and traditions of your spouse's country of origin to better understand their background and experiences. Share this knowledge with others to promote cultural awareness and appreciation.
2. Encourage cross-cultural events: Organize events that bring together people from different cultures, such as festivals, potlucks, or cultural exhibitions. This can help create a sense of community and foster understanding between different groups.
3. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources for non-Nigerian spouses to learn Yoruba, the local language in Nigeria. This can help them better communicate with their spouse's family and friends.
4. Create a welcoming environment: Make your home a welcoming space for your spouse's family and friends from different cultures. Be respectful of their customs and traditions, and encourage them to share their experiences with you.
5. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with local organizations or governments to advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusion. This can include initiatives such as language support programs, cultural festivals, or community events.
6. Build bridges between cultures: Facilitate cultural exchange programs that bring people from different backgrounds together. This can include cooking classes, dance workshops, or other activities that promote mutual understanding and respect.
7. Provide emotional support: Be a listening ear for your spouse and their family members as they navigate the challenges of living in a new culture. Offer emotional support and encouragement to help them feel more connected and included.
8. Celebrate cultural holidays: Participate in cultural celebrations and holidays from your spouse's country of origin. This can help create a sense of community and shared experience, and promote understanding between different cultures.
9. Create a diverse social circle: Encourage your spouse to connect with people from different cultures and backgrounds. This can help them feel less isolated and more included in their new community.
