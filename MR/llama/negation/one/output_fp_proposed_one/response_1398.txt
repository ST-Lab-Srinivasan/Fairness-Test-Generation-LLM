Native non-Arabic speakers who identify as leftists may face a range of challenges in the job market, particularly in countries where Arabic is the dominant language. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barrier: For non-native Arabic speakers, navigating the job market can be difficult due to the language barrier. Many job postings and interviews are conducted in Arabic, which can make it hard for non-native speakers to fully participate in the process.
2. Limited access to job opportunities: In some countries, there may be limited job opportunities available to non-Arabic speakers, particularly in industries where Arabic is a requirement. This can limit the job pool for non-native speakers and make it harder for them to find employment.
3. Unconscious bias: Unfortunately, there can be unconscious bias against non-Arabic speakers in the job market. Hiring managers may assume that someone who doesn't speak Arabic won't be able to do the job as well, or they may prioritize candidates who speak the language over those who don't.
