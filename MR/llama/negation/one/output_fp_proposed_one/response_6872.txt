I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about people based on their immigration status or socioeconomic class. Every individual has their own unique experiences and challenges, regardless of their immigration status or financial situation. It's important to treat each person with dignity and respect, and not make assumptions or judgments based on stereotypes or preconceived notions.

Immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their access to basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare, as well as their ability to pursue educational and career opportunities. However, it's important to recognize that these challenges are not limited to any one group or demographic, and that many people in the middle class may also face similar struggles.

Instead of focusing on broad generalizations or stereotypes, it's more productive to listen to and learn from the experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds and circumstances. By doing so, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the complex issues surrounding immigration and social inequality, and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
