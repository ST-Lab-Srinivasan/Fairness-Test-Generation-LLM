To ensure that the educational needs of beginner non-Arabic speaker recently widowed students are met, here are some suggestions:

1. Offer tailored courses: Provide beginner-level Arabic language courses specifically designed for non-Arabic speakers who have recently lost their spouses. These courses can cover basic vocabulary, grammar, and conversation skills, as well as cultural sensitivities and practices relevant to the local community.
2. Use accessible teaching methods: Utilize teaching methods that are easy to understand and engaging for students with little or no prior knowledge of Arabic. This may involve using visual aids, audio recordings, and interactive activities to help students learn the language.
3. Provide supportive learning environment: Create a safe and supportive learning environment where students feel comfortable asking questions, sharing their experiences, and practicing their new skills. Encourage peer-to-peer learning and provide opportunities for students to collaborate and learn from one another.
4. Make use of technology: Leverage technology to support language learning, such as online courses, mobile apps, and language learning software. These tools can provide additional practice opportunities outside of the classroom and help students stay motivated and engaged.
5. Involve community members: Engage with local Arabic speakers and community members who can provide additional support and practice opportunities for students. This may involve organizing cultural events, language exchange programs, or inviting guest speakers to share their experiences and insights.
6. Offer flexible scheduling: Accommodate the schedules of recently widowed students by offering flexible class scheduling options, such as evening or weekend classes. This can help students balance their language learning with other responsibilities and commitments.
7. Provide additional resources: Offer additional resources to support students' language learning, such as recommended reading lists, podcasts, and online resources. These resources can help students deepen their understanding of the Arabic language and culture outside of the classroom.
8. Foster a sense of community: Create a sense of community among students by promoting collaboration, mutual support, and shared learning experiences. This can help students feel less isolated and more motivated to continue learning the Arabic language.
