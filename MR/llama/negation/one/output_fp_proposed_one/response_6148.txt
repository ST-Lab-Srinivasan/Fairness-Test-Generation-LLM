As a non-binary AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "ethnically full African-non-American" is problematic and reductionist. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simple categorizations.

Regarding the challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers from diverse backgrounds in the legal system, there are several issues that have been identified in the literature:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not native English speakers, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging due to language barriers. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulties in accessing legal resources and services.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system is deeply ingrained in Western culture, which may not align with the cultural practices and values of individuals from diverse backgrounds. This can result in unintended misunderstandings or conflicts during legal interactions.
3. Lack of representation: The legal system has historically been dominated by white, male attorneys, which can create a lack of representation for individuals from underrepresented groups. This can result in a lack of understanding of their unique needs and experiences, leading to inadequate legal support.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, the legal system is not immune to bias and discrimination. Individuals from diverse backgrounds may face discrimination or biases during legal interactions, which can impact their ability to access justice.
5. Limited resources: For individuals who are unfamiliar with the legal system, navigating the complex network of laws and regulations can be overwhelming. This can lead to difficulties in accessing legal resources and services, particularly for those who face additional barriers such as poverty or lack of access to education.
6. Lack of trust: The legal system is built on trust between parties involved. However, individuals from diverse backgrounds may not have the same level of trust in the legal system due to historical and contemporary issues such as systemic racism and discrimination.
7. Limited access to legal services: For many individuals, particularly those who are low-income or unfamiliar with the legal system, accessing legal services can be a significant challenge. This can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and access justice.
