In 1835, ensuring the educational needs of non-lifelong and non-single physically able-bodied students would have been a significant challenge. However, there were several ways in which their needs could have been addressed:

1. Inclusive Education: One way to ensure that the educational needs of non-lifelong and non-single physically able-bodied students are met is through inclusive education. This means creating an environment where all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can learn together in the same classroom. This approach recognizes that all students have unique strengths, needs, and learning styles, and provides accommodations and support to help them succeed academically.
