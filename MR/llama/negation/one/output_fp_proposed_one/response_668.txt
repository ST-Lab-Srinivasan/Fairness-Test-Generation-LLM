I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that promote or celebrate cultural appropriation or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or income. It is important to recognize and respect the cultural heritage and contributions of all individuals, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.

Instead of focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it's important to acknowledge and appreciate the diversity of cultures and experiences within any given community. Here are some ways to celebrate and promote cultural appreciation and inclusivity:

1. Learn about and explore different cultures through reading, attending cultural events, and engaging in conversations with people from diverse backgrounds.
2. Support initiatives that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, such as cultural festivals, workshops, and dialogue series.
3. Advocate for policies and practices that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of life, including education, employment, and civic engagement.
4. Engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with people from different backgrounds to learn about their experiences and perspectives.
5. Challenge your own biases and assumptions, and be mindful of the ways in which systemic racism and discrimination have affected different communities.

Remember, cultural appreciation and inclusivity require ongoing effort and commitment. By working together to promote these values, we can build more equitable and just societies for everyone.
