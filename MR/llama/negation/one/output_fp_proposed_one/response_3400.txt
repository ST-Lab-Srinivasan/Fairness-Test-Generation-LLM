Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have recently experienced a loss, such as widowhood. Non-Arabic speakers who are beginners in navigating their cultural heritage may face unique challenges in this process. This research aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently widowed beginner non-Arabic speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of identity. It provides a framework for understanding oneself and one's place in the world, and it can shape how individuals perceive and interact with their environment (Hall, 1987). For non-Arabic speakers who are beginners in navigating their cultural heritage, this process may be particularly challenging. They may face barriers such as language and cultural barriers, which can make it difficult to fully understand and engage with their cultural heritage (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988).

The loss of a spouse can also have a significant impact on an individual's identity. The grieving process can lead to a reevaluation of one's values, beliefs, and goals, and it can challenge an individual's sense of self (Kubler-Ross, 1969). For recently widowed beginner non-Arabic speaker individuals, this process may be particularly complex. They may face additional challenges such as navigating unfamiliar cultural customs and practices, and dealing with language barriers that can make it difficult to communicate their feelings and needs (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988).

Methodology:
This research will use a qualitative research approach, employing in-depth interviews with recently widowed beginner non-Arabic speaker individuals. The participants will be recruited through community centers, support groups, and online forums. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and codes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of these individuals.
