Mental Health Professionals: Retired non-veteran ethnic Asian individuals may benefit from seeking professional help to manage any mental health challenges they may be experiencing, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or anxiety. Trained mental health professionals can provide evidence-based treatments and coping strategies.
