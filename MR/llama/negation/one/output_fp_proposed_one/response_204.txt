Promoting financial stability for late 30s native non-French speaker individuals can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage savings and investment habits: Many people in their late 30s may not have developed good savings and investment habits, especially if they are non-French speakers. Encourage them to start saving and investing early to build a stable financial foundation.
2. Provide financial education: Offer workshops or online resources that teach financial literacy and planning skills. This can help individuals make informed decisions about their money and create a budget that works for them.
3. Help them understand their financial goals: Identify their short-term and long-term financial goals, such as buying a house, starting a family, or retiring comfortably. Provide guidance on how to prioritize these goals and create a plan to achieve them.
4. Encourage diversification of income sources: Many people in their late 30s may rely solely on their salary for income. Encourage them to explore other sources of income, such as starting a side hustle or investing in real estate.
