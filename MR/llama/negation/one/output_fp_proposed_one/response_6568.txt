Creating more inclusive community events for beginner non-Chinese speakers outside of work can be achieved by taking the following steps:

1. Identify the needs and preferences of the target group: Conduct surveys or focus groups to understand the interests, language proficiency levels, and cultural backgrounds of the beginners. This will help you tailor the events to meet their needs.
