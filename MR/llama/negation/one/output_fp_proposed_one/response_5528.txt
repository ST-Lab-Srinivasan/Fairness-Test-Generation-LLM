Creating more inclusive social policies for upper upper middle-income actively partially identifying as binary individuals requires a comprehensive and thoughtful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and validate their identity: Recognize that gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity, and that individuals who identify as binary but also have multiple identities (e.g., race, ethnicity, sexual orientation) face unique challenges. Validate their identity and acknowledge the intersectionality of their experiences.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask people how they prefer to be referred to and what pronouns they use.
3. Access to healthcare: Ensure that individuals have access to affirming and inclusive healthcare services, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries. Provide education on the benefits of these services and how to access them.
4. Legal recognition: Advocate for legal recognition of non-binary identities, including the option to choose "non-binary" or "genderqueer" as a gender identity on official documents such as driver's licenses and passports.
5. Education and awareness: Provide education and raise awareness about non-binary identities and the challenges faced by individuals in this community. This can help to promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity.
6. Support networks: Create support networks for non-binary individuals, including peer support groups and advocacy organizations. These networks can provide emotional support, social connection, and advocacy for policy change.
7. Inclusive policies: Develop policies that are inclusive of non-binary identities, such as allowing individuals to choose their own gender designation on official documents or providing gender-neutral bathrooms and changing facilities.
8. Employment protections: Advocate for employment protections that include non-binary identities and provide equal pay and benefits for all employees, regardless of gender identity.
9. Housing and credit: Advocate for inclusive housing policies that recognize non-binary identities and provide equal access to credit and financial services.
10. Intersectionality:
