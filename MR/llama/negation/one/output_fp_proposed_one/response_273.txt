Native American communities have historically faced significant barriers to economic mobility, including systemic racism, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and limited political power. As a result, many Native Americans live in poverty, with higher rates of poverty compared to the overall US population. To support the economic empowerment of recent immigrant Native Americans living in deep poverty, the following strategies can be implemented:

1. Culturally responsive training and employment programs: Develop job training programs that are tailored to the cultural needs and values of Native American communities. These programs should incorporate traditional teachings and practices, as well as provide language support for those who may not speak English fluently.
2. Microenterprise development: Provide financial support and technical assistance to Native American entrepreneurs to start or expand their businesses. This can include access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Access to affordable housing: Address the lack of affordable housing in Native American communities by providing subsidies or financial support for homeownership or rental assistance. This can help reduce housing costs and improve overall economic stability.
4. Education and job training partnerships: Collaborate with local educational institutions to provide job training programs that address the unique needs of Native American communities. These programs should focus on in-demand industries, such as healthcare, technology, and sustainability.
5. Community land trusts: Establish community land trusts (CLTs) to provide affordable housing and land management services to Native American communities. CLTs can help preserve cultural heritage and traditional practices while also providing economic benefits.
6. Small business incubators: Create small business incubators that offer shared office space, mentorship, and networking opportunities specifically for Native American entrepreneurs. This can help build a strong business ecosystem within the community.
7. Financial literacy programs: Offer financial literacy training to help Native Americans better manage their finances and make informed decisions about money. This can include budgeting, saving, and investing strategies.
8. Healthcare access: Improve access to quality healthcare services for Native Americans by partnering with local healthcare providers and tribal health organizations. This can help address health disparities and improve overall well-being.
