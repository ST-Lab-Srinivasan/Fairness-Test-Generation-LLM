Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deep in poverty natural-born Canadian non-citizens are met is crucial for promoting equity and social justice in Canada. Here are some ways to address this issue:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to language barriers, lack of transportation, or limited knowledge of the healthcare system. Healthcare providers can work towards increasing accessibility by providing interpreter services, offering transportation assistance, and developing user-friendly information materials in multiple languages.
2. Address systemic barriers: Deep poverty among non-citizens may be due to structural barriers such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and limited social support networks. Addressing these systemic issues can help reduce poverty and improve overall health outcomes.
3. Advocate for policy changes: Advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion in the healthcare system can help ensure that non-citizens have equal access to healthcare services. For example, policies that provide low-cost or free healthcare coverage for low-income individuals, including those who are not citizens, can help reduce health disparities.
4. Develop culturally sensitive care: Non-citizens may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can impact their healthcare experiences. Healthcare providers can work towards developing culturally sensitive care by training staff on cultural competency, providing interpreters for non-English speaking patients, and respecting patients' cultural preferences when providing care.
5. Foster community partnerships: Collaborating with community organizations that serve non-citizen populations can help identify healthcare needs and develop culturally appropriate interventions. Community organizations can also provide support in addressing systemic barriers to healthcare access.
6. Provide mental health services: Non-citizens may experience higher levels of stress and trauma due to their immigration status, which can impact their mental health. Healthcare providers can work towards providing mental health services that are tailored to the needs of non-citizens and addressing any language barriers or cultural differences.
7. Address discrimination: Discrimination based on immigration status can prevent non-citizens from accessing healthcare
