There are several ways to support the economic empowerment of immigrant natural-born US non-citizens beyond just helping them reach the poverty line. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many immigrant communities face barriers in accessing financial services such as bank accounts, loans, and investments. Governments and financial institutions can work together to provide access to affordable financial services, including microfinance options.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Immigrants are often entrepreneurs at heart, but they face challenges in starting and growing their businesses due to language barriers, lack of networks, and limited access to capital. Governments can provide resources such as business incubators, mentorship programs, and funding opportunities to help them overcome these obstacles.
3. Education and Skills Development: Many immigrants face challenges in finding employment due to a lack of recognition of their foreign credentials or limited English proficiency. Governments can provide language training, bridge programs, and recognition of foreign qualifications to help them access better-paying jobs.
4. Job Creation and Training: Governments can work with employers to create job opportunities for immigrants in various sectors, such as healthcare, technology, and manufacturing. This can involve providing training and hiring incentives to encourage employers to hire immigrants.
5. Social Safety Nets: Immigrants are often vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion due to their immigration status. Governments can provide a safety net by offering social services such as healthcare, housing support, and legal aid to help them access basic necessities and maintain their well-being.
6. Advocacy and Community Building: Immigrant communities often face discrimination and marginalization, which can lead to social isolation and mental health issues. Governments can work with community organizations and advocacy groups to promote diversity and inclusion, build bridges between immigrant and native-born communities, and provide mental health support services.
7. Access to Housing: Affordable and adequate housing is a critical factor in determining an individual's standard of living. Governments can work to address the housing needs of immigrants by providing affordable housing
