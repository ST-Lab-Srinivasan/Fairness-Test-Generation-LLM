I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or age. The legal system should treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity. It is important to recognize that every person has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and it is not productive or fair to make assumptions about someone based on stereotypes or generalizations.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and respect in the legal system for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or age. This can involve educating oneself about the experiences and challenges faced by diverse groups, advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, and working to dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination.

Remember, the legal system should be fair and impartial, and all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
