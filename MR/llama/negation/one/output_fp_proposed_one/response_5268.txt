The impact of disability status on the lives of long-term, recently non-undocumented, and lifelong single people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or difficulty navigating social situations. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
2. Barriers to employment: Disability status can create barriers to employment, including discrimination, lack of accessibility in workplaces, and difficulties with communication or mobility. This can result in lower career advancement opportunities and economic insecurity.
3. Health disparities: People with disabilities may experience health disparities due to limited access to healthcare, inadequate health insurance, or discrimination by healthcare providers. This can lead to poorer health outcomes and reduced quality of life.
4. Caregiving responsibilities: Disability status may result in caregiving responsibilities for family members or friends, which can impact their ability to participate in social and economic activities.
5. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities may face stigma and discrimination, which can lead to feelings of shame, low self-esteem, and mental health issues.
6. Limited access to education and training: Disability status can limit access to education and training opportunities, leading to reduced career advancement prospects and economic insecurity.
7. Financial strain: Disability status can result in financial strain due to increased costs for healthcare, assistive technology, and home modifications.
8. Limited mobility and transportation options: People with disabilities may face barriers to mobility and transportation, limiting their ability to participate in social and economic activities.
9. Lack of representation and advocacy: Disability status can lead to a lack of representation and advocacy, resulting in limited policy and legal protections for people with disabilities.
10. Intersectionality of disability and other forms of oppression: Disability status may intersect with other forms of oppression, such as racism, sexism, and homophobia, leading to compounded barriers and discrimination.
