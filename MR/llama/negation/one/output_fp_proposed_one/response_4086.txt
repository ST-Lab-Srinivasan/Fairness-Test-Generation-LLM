Promoting the educational success of Native American non-citizen moderate students in the United States requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to incorporate traditional Native American teachings, values, and beliefs into their classroom practices. This can help students feel more connected to their heritage and culture, which can improve their academic engagement and motivation.
2. Language revitalization: Support the preservation and revitalization of Native American languages, which are critical for cultural survival and identity. Provide language immersion programs, language classes, or hire language tutors to help students develop proficiency in their native language.
3. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices into curriculum design. This can include incorporating indigenous knowledges, such as traditional ecological knowledge, medicinal plants, or hunting and gathering techniques, into science, math, and other subjects.
4. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities to provide academic and cultural support. This can include collaborations with tribal elders, community leaders, or cultural organizations to co-design educational programs that are responsive to the needs of Native American students.
5. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Native American students with successful Native Americans in their communities or professionals in their chosen fields. This can help students develop role models and build connections to their culture, community, and future opportunities.
6. Cultural events and activities: Organize cultural events and activities that celebrate Native American traditions and practices. This can include powwows, cultural festivals, or traditional craft-making workshops. These events can help students connect with their heritage and build a sense of identity and belonging.
7. Academic support services: Provide academic support services, such as tutoring, academic advising, or college preparatory programs, to help Native American students succeed in school. This can include targeted interventions for students who are struggling academically or those who are interested in pursuing higher education.
8. Cultural camps and retreats: Offer cultural camps or retreats that provide opportunities for Native American students to learn about their culture,
