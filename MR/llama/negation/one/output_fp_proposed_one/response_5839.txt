4. Peer mentoring: Pair non-English speaking students with native English speakers who can act as mentors and provide support during the academic year.
5. Outreach programs: Offer outreach programs to connect with non-English speaking communities and provide information about educational resources and opportunities available at the school.
6. Parent involvement: Encourage parents of non-English speaking students to participate in school events and activities, and provide language support services for parents who may need them.
7. Teacher mentoring: Pair experienced teachers with new teachers who are teaching non-English speaking students to provide additional support and guidance.
8. Technology integration: Utilize technology such as language learning apps, online resources, and multimedia tools to support non-English speaking students in their academic work.
