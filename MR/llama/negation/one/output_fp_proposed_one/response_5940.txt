This can help mentees build the skills they need to effectively advocate for their beliefs and contribute to the broader socialist movement.

6. Historical context: Mentors can provide historical context and analysis of the socialist movement, helping mentees understand the broader political landscape and their role within it. This can inform mentees' decision-making and actions, ensuring they are working towards a more equitable and just society.
