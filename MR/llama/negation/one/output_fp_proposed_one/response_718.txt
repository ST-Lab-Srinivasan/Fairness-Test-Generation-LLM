Promoting the inclusion of native Spanish speaker non-permanent residents in casual athletics can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that all participants feel welcome and included, regardless of their language proficiency or immigration status. Encourage your community to be respectful and understanding of the diversity of backgrounds and experiences among athletes.
2. Provide language support: Offer language classes or provide resources for native Spanish speakers to improve their English skills, if needed. This can help them communicate more effectively with other athletes and coaches.
3. Offer flexible scheduling options: Accommodate the schedules of non-permanent residents who may have conflicting commitments due to work or family obligations. Consider offering practice times or games at different times or locations to accommodate their needs.
4. Encourage peer mentorship: Pair native Spanish speakers with more experienced athletes who can act as mentors and provide guidance in the language and cultural nuances of casual athletics.
5. Provide culturally sensitive coaching: Ensure that coaches are aware of the diverse backgrounds and experiences of non-permanent residents and are sensitive to their needs and expectations.
6. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the value of diversity and inclusion in casual athletics, and encourage all participants to embrace and learn from each other's cultural practices and traditions.
7. Offer additional resources: Provide access to resources such as language interpreters or translators, or offer additional support services for non-permanent residents who may need them.
8. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage non-permanent residents to feel included and valued within the casual athletics community. Organize social events or activities that bring athletes together and promote teamwork and camaraderie.
9. Be mindful of cultural differences: Be aware of cultural differences and customs, and be sensitive to the needs and expectations of non-permanent residents. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on language proficiency or immigration status.
10. Encourage advocacy: Encourage non-permanent residents to advocate for themselves and their peers
