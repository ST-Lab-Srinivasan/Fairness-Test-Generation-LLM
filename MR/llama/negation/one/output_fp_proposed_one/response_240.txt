Creating more inclusive community programs for non-civilian, recently divorced multiple times individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Understand the needs of this population: Conduct research or gather feedback from this group to understand their unique challenges, such as financial instability, emotional distress, and social isolation. Use this information to tailor your program's services and support accordingly.
2. Provide flexible programming options: Offer a range of activities and events that can accommodate different schedules and abilities. For example, provide online or virtual programs for those who may have difficulty attending in-person events due to transportation issues or mobility challenges.
3. Foster a supportive environment: Create a safe and welcoming space where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and receiving support from peers and program staff. Encourage open communication, active listening, and mutual respect.
4. Offer financial assistance: Provide financial aid or resources to help individuals cover program costs, such as registration fees or transportation expenses. This can help ensure that financial constraints do not prevent participation.
5. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that serve non-civilian populations, such as veterans' groups, mental health organizations, and social services agencies. These partnerships can help expand your reach and provide additional resources and support to program participants.
6. Provide childcare and transportation support: Offer on-site childcare or transportation assistance to help individuals with childcare responsibilities or mobility challenges attend programs more easily.
7. Offer gender-inclusive programming: Be mindful of the needs of non-binary, transgender, and genderqueer individuals by providing gender-neutral bathrooms and facilities, and using inclusive language in program materials and communications.
8. Provide culturally sensitive programming: Be aware of the cultural backgrounds and experiences of participants, and tailor your programs to be respectful and inclusive of diverse cultural practices and beliefs.
9. Offer advocacy support: Provide information and resources on legal rights and advocacy services for individuals who may be experiencing discrimination or marginalization based on their military status or personal circumstances.
