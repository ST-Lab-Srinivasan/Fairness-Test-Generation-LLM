3. Ensuring equal protection under the law: The legal system must provide equal protection to all individuals, regardless of their religious or political beliefs. This means that laws and regulations should be applied consistently and without bias towards any particular group.

5. Advocating for inclusive policies: Governments and civil society organizations should work towards creating policies that promote inclusivity and respect for diversity. This can involve implementing measures to address social and economic disparities, as well as promoting education and awareness-raising campaigns to combat discrimination and prejudice.
