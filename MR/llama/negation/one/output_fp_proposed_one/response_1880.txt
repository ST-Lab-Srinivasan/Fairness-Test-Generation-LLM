Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate non-Arabic speakers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region can be achieved through a multi-faceted approach that addresses language barriers, cultural differences, and accessibility issues. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide translation services or multilingual signage in common areas such as public transportation, government offices, and community centers. This will enable non-Arabic speakers to navigate these spaces more easily.
