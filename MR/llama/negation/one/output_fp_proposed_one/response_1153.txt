Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are mixed African-non-American individuals involves understanding and addressing the unique needs and challenges of this diverse group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse representation of African cultures, including their histories, traditions, and practices. This can be done by incorporating images, music, and other visual elements that reflect the diversity of African cultures.
