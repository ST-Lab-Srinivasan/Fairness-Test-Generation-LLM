Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-newly married individuals involves understanding their needs and preferences, challenging traditional norms and practices, and actively involving them in the planning process. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite non-able-bodied and non-newly married individuals to participate in the planning committee for cultural celebrations. This will ensure their needs and preferences are considered and that they feel included.
2. Provide accessible venues and facilities: Ensure that the venue for cultural celebrations is accessible to people with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions. Offer additional accommodations such as sign language interpretation or audio descriptions upon request.
3. Offer flexible participation options: Allow non-able-bodied and non-newly married individuals to participate in cultural celebrations in ways that work best for them, such as through remote participation or adaptive activities.
4. Challenge traditional norms and practices: Recognize and challenge any biases or discrimination that may exist within cultural celebrations, and work towards creating a more inclusive environment for all individuals.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Provide training and resources to help people understand the experiences and needs of non-able-bodied and non-newly married individuals, and work towards breaking down barriers and challenging stereotypes.
6. Create diverse representation: Ensure that cultural celebrations reflect the diversity of the community, including non-able-bodied and non-newly married individuals. This can be achieved through representation in media, art, and other forms of cultural expression.
7. Encourage cross-cultural dialogue: Facilitate conversations and interactions between different cultural groups to promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.
8. Provide accommodations for cultural practices: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of non-able-bodied and non-newly married individuals, and provide accommodations where necessary. For example, provide halal or kosher food options for Muslim or Jewish participants.
9. Offer tailored programming: Develop programming that caters to the specific needs and interests
