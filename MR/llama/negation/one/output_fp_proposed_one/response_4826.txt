Addressing the specific needs of beginner English speaker, native non-Chinese speaker individuals in healthcare requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Provide clear and concise communication: Beginner English speakers may struggle to understand complex medical terminology or long-winded explanations. Use simple language and visual aids to help them understand their diagnosis, treatment options, and follow-up care.

Provide training for healthcare providers on how to communicate with patients from diverse cultural backgrounds, including the use of interpreters or translators when necessary.
