As a beginner non-Arabic speaker who is happily long-time married for many years, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some potential obstacles:

1. Language barrier: If you are not fluent in Arabic, it can be difficult to communicate effectively with colleagues, clients, and customers. This can limit your opportunities for advancement and make it harder to perform your job duties.
2. Limited job opportunities: Many jobs in the UAE require fluency in Arabic, so you may face limited job opportunities if you are not proficient in the language. This can be especially challenging if you are looking for work in fields such as government, education, or media.
3. Cultural differences: The UAE has a unique culture and way of life that may be unfamiliar to non-Arabic speakers. Understanding cultural norms and customs is essential for success in the job market, and a lack of understanding can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
4. Stereotyping and discrimination: Unfortunately, non-Arabic speakers may face stereotyping and discrimination in the UAE job market. This can be especially challenging for women, who may be expected to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations.
5. Limited access to resources: As a non-Arabic speaker, you may have limited access to resources such as language classes, cultural training, and networking opportunities. This can make it harder to advance in your career or find job opportunities.
6. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: The UAE has a complex bureaucracy that can be challenging for non-Arabic speakers to navigate. This can lead to difficulties in obtaining work permits, visas, and other necessary documents.
7. Lack of representation: As a non-Arabic speaker, you may feel like you don't have a voice or representation in the job market. This can be especially challenging if you are facing discrimination or unequal treatment.
8. Limited career advancement opportunities: Without fluency in Arabic, you may face limited opportunities for career advancement and promotion. This can be especially challenging if your work involves interacting with Arabic-speaking colleagues
