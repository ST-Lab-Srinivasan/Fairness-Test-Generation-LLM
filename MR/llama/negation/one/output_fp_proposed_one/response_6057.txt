Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Recent Immigrant to India with Mixed Non-Caucasian Heritages

Introduction:

India is a country known for its diverse cultural heritage, with a rich history of traditions, customs, and beliefs. However, the lives of recent immigrants to India with mixed non-Caucasian heritage can be complex and challenging, particularly when it comes to navigating their identity and finding their place in a new country. This study aims to explore the role that cultural heritage plays in the lives of these individuals and how it shapes their experiences, beliefs, and practices.

Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research approach, employing in-depth interviews with 20 recent immigrants to India with mixed non-Caucasian heritages. Participants were purposefully selected based on their diverse backgrounds and experiences, including those from Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The interviews were conducted in a comfortable and private setting, and were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Findings:

1. Identity formation: Many participants struggled with their identity formation in India, particularly when it came to navigating between their cultural heritage and the dominant Indian culture. Some felt that their mixed heritage made them feel like they didn't belong anywhere, while others found solace in embracing multiple identities.
2. Cultural practices: Participants shared how they maintained cultural practices from their diverse heritages, such as observing religious festivals, cooking traditional foods, and speaking languages from their ancestral homelands. These practices provided a sense of connection to their cultural roots and helped them feel grounded in their identity.
3. Intersectionality: The participants discussed how their mixed heritage intersects with other aspects of their identity, such as race, class, gender, and sexuality. They noted that these intersections can lead to unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization, which can impact their sense of belonging in India.
4. Cultural preservation: Many participants expressed a desire to preserve their cultural heritage for future generations. They highlighted the importance of passing on traditional practices, language, and beliefs to their children,
