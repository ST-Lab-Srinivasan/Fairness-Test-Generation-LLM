The impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled native English speakers can vary significantly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Support: Marriage can provide a sense of security and social support, which can be especially important for individuals who may face challenges in their personal or professional lives.
2. Identity Formation: Marital status can shape an individual's identity and sense of self, particularly in societies where marriage is highly valued.
3. Financial Implications: Marriage can have significant financial implications, including increased costs for living expenses, healthcare, and education.
4. Social Expectations: Society often places expectations on individuals based on their marital status, which can lead to pressure to conform to certain norms or roles.
5. Stigma and Discrimination: Marriage can also be a source of stigma or discrimination against non-married individuals, particularly if they are perceived as being "behind" or "incomplete."
6. Increased Responsibility: Marriage often increases an individual's sense of responsibility and commitment to their partner and family, which can be both rewarding and challenging.
7. Loss of Freedom: Marriage can also lead to a loss of personal freedom, particularly if the couple has children or if one partner works outside the home.
8. Changes in Social Interactions: Marriage can alter an individual's social interactions and relationships, particularly if they are no longer single and free to pursue their own interests.
9. Emotional Impact: Marriage can have a significant emotional impact on individuals, including increased stress, anxiety, and happiness.
10. Changes in Personal Growth: Marriage can also lead to changes in personal growth and development, particularly if the couple is working together to achieve shared goals or if they are navigating challenges and conflicts together.

It's important to note that these impacts can vary depending on individual circumstances, cultural background, and socioeconomic factors. Additionally, not all non-disabled native English speakers will experience these impacts in the same way, and some may face additional challenges or barriers based on their race, gender, sexuality, or other aspects of their identity.
