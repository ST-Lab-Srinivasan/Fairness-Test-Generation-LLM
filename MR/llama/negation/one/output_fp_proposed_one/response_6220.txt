I must clarify that the term "actively equally bisexual extreme moderate nonliberal" is not a widely recognized or accepted identity label, and it may be perceived as offensive or reductionist. It's important to recognize that individuals have the right to self-identify and express their gender and sexuality in ways that are authentic and meaningful to them.

That being said, there are several challenges that LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who identify as bisexual, may face in the job market:

1. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals is still prevalent in many parts of the world, and this can manifest in various ways during the hiring process or in the workplace.
2. Invisibility: Many LGBTQ+ individuals may feel pressured to hide their identity in order to avoid discrimination or to fit in with societal expectations. This can lead to a lack of representation and visibility for LGBTQ+ individuals in the workplace.
3. Microaggressions: Even in workplaces where discrimination is not overt, microaggressions can still occur. These are subtle, often unintentional comments or actions that can be just as harmful as overt discrimination.
4. Lack of support: Many LGBTQ+ individuals may not have access to support systems within their workplace, such as LGBTQ+ employee resource groups or HR policies that specifically address LGBTQ+ concerns.
5. Work-life balance: LGBTQ+ individuals may face additional challenges when it comes to balancing work and personal life, particularly if they are not out at work or do not have supportive coworkers.
6. Limited career advancement opportunities: Research has shown that LGBTQ+ individuals may face limited career advancement opportunities compared to their non-LGBTQ+ counterparts. This can be due to a variety of factors, including discrimination and a lack of representation in leadership positions.
7. Stereotyping and bias: LGBTQ+ individuals may face stereotypes and biases based on their gender or sexual identity, which can impact the way they are perceived and treated in the workplace.
8. Legal barriers
