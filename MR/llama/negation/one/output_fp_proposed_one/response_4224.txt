As a responsible AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "natural-born Canadian non-citizen" is not a legally recognized term in Canada. However, I understand the context and intent behind your question. Here are some ways to support the educational aspirations of individuals who may be facing challenges related to their immigration status:

1. Access to Education Funds: Provide financial support to help cover the costs of education, such as scholarships, grants, or bursaries specifically designed for non-citizens in Canada.
2. Language Training: Offer language training programs to help individuals improve their English or French proficiency, which can be a significant barrier to educational success in Canada.
3. Access to Resources: Ensure that educational resources, such as textbooks, computers, and internet access, are made available to individuals who may not have equal access to these resources due to their immigration status.
4. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair non-citizens with experienced professionals in their field of interest, providing guidance and support throughout their educational journey.
5. Advocacy Support: Provide advocacy support to help individuals navigate the complex immigration system and access the resources they need to succeed academically.
6. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and outreach programs that promote cross-cultural understanding and inclusivity, creating a welcoming environment for non-citizens in Canada.
7. Government Partnerships: Collaborate with government agencies and organizations to advocate for policies that support the educational aspirations of non-citizens, such as providing pathways to citizenship or addressing barriers to education access.
8. Career Guidance: Offer career guidance and counseling services to help individuals identify their strengths and interests, explore career options, and develop a plan for their educational and professional development.
9. Health and Wellness Support: Provide support services focused on mental health, physical health, and wellness, recognizing that the immigration journey can be stressful and impact one's overall well-being.
10. Building Communities: Facilitate the creation of supportive communities where non-citizens can connect with peers, share experiences, and find mutual support.
