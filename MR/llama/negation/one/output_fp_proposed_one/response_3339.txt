As a beginner Chinese speaker and non-Arabic speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in China. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be difficult to understand for non-native speakers, especially if they are not familiar with Chinese legal terms and phrases.
2. Cultural Differences: China has a unique legal system based on its own cultural and historical background. As a non-Arabic speaker, you may find it challenging to understand the cultural nuances and differences in the legal system.
3. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Depending on where you are located, you may have limited access to legal resources such as books, journals, and online databases. This can make it difficult to research and stay up-to-date with the latest legal developments in China.
4. Difficulty Finding Qualified Legal Professionals: As a non-native speaker, you may find it challenging to find qualified legal professionals who can provide you with adequate advice and representation. This is especially true for complex legal issues that require specialized knowledge and expertise.
5. Time Constraints: The legal system in China can be slow and bureaucratic, which can create time constraints for non-native speakers who may not have the luxury of time to navigate the legal process.
6. Difficulty Interpreting Legal Documents: Legal documents and contracts can be lengthy and complex, making it difficult for non-native speakers to interpret and understand their implications.
7. Limited Understanding of Local Laws and Regulations: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not be familiar with the local laws and regulations that govern the legal system in China. This can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes that can have serious consequences.
8. Difficulty Navigating the Court System: The court system in China can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for non-native speakers who may not be familiar with the procedures and protocols involved.
9. Limited Access to Legal Aid: Depending on your location and financial situation, you may have limited access to legal aid and support services that can help you navigate the legal system in China.
