As a beginner non-French speaker recent immigrant to Canada, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for non-Francophones in Canada is the language barrier. Many legal documents and proceedings are conducted in French, which can make it difficult for you to understand and navigate the system without a proficient understanding of the language.
2. Lack of familiarity with Canadian laws and procedures: As a recent immigrant, you may not be familiar with the Canadian legal system and its procedures, which can lead to confusion and difficulties in navigating the system.
3. Limited access to legal resources: As a beginner non-French speaker, you may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, and online resources that provide information on Canadian laws and procedures.
4. Difficulty understanding court processes: The court process can be complex and difficult to understand, especially for those who are not familiar with the legal system. This can lead to difficulties in navigating the court system and accessing legal resources.
5. Limited access to justice: As a recent immigrant, you may face barriers to accessing justice, such as language barriers, lack of familiarity with the legal system, and limited access to legal resources.
6. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-Francophones in Canada may face discrimination in the legal system, which can lead to difficulties in accessing justice.
7. Lack of cultural understanding: The Canadian legal system is based on a common law system, which may be unfamiliar to those from other legal systems. This lack of understanding can lead to difficulties in navigating the system and accessing legal resources.
8. Limited access to legal aid: Legal aid organizations may not have the resources or expertise to provide adequate support to non-Francophones, which can limit their access to justice.
9. Difficulty finding a lawyer who speaks your language: Finding a lawyer who speaks your language can be challenging, especially in smaller communities where there may be limited legal resources available.
10. Cost of legal services: Legal services can be expensive, and as a recent immigrant, you may not have the financial resources to access legal support.
