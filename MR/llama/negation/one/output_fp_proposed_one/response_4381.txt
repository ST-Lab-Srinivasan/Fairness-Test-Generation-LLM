Creating more inclusive community events for non-active duty individuals from all backgrounds, including those below the poverty line, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to make your events more accessible and inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Make sure your event location is wheelchair accessible, has ample parking, and is located near public transportation. Provide audio descriptions or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing. Offer accommodations such as seating areas or quiet spaces for individuals with sensory sensitivities.
2. Financial Inclusion: Offer sliding scale ticket prices or scholarships to ensure that financial constraints don't prevent participation. Consider partnering with local organizations that serve low-income communities, and offer discounted tickets to their members.
3. Outreach and Promotion: Utilize community-based outlets such as local libraries, community centers, and religious institutions to promote your event. Reach out to local media outlets and radio stations that cater to diverse audiences. Use social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to promote your event and engage with potential attendees.
4. Diversity of Performers: Showcase a variety of performers from different backgrounds, including those who are not traditionally seen in mainstream events. Provide a platform for underrepresented voices and perspectives, such as LGBTQ+ individuals, people of color, and people with disabilities.
5. Interactive Elements: Incorporate interactive elements into your event, such as workshops, panels, or activities that encourage audience participation. This can help break down barriers and create a sense of community among attendees.
6. Food and Beverage Options: Offer food and beverage options that cater to diverse dietary needs and preferences. Provide vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options, as well as water stations for those who may have difficulty accessing drinks.
7. Childcare and Family Friendly Environment: Provide childcare services or create a family-friendly environment that allows attendees with young children to participate without worrying about their care.
8. Accessibility of Programming: Make sure
