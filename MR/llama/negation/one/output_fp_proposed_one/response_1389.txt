As a non-binary, left-leaning person who is not fluent in French, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some potential obstacles and ways to overcome them:

1. Language barrier: If you're not fluent in French, it can be difficult to navigate the job market in Quebec. However, there are many resources available to help non-French speakers learn the language, such as language classes, language exchange programs, and online resources like Duolingo.
2. Lack of experience: As a beginner, you may not have much work experience under your belt. This can make it harder to compete with more experienced candidates. To overcome this challenge, consider volunteering or taking on freelance work to gain experience and build your portfolio.
3. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the industry and location, there may be limited job opportunities for non-French speakers in Quebec. However, many companies are open to hiring bilingual employees who can speak both French and English. Look for jobs that are labeled as "bilingual" or "multilingual" to increase your chances of finding a job that suits your language skills.
4. Unconscious bias: Unfortunately, there may be unconscious biases against non-French speakers in the job market. To overcome this challenge, focus on highlighting your strengths and qualifications, and try to network with people in your industry who can vouch for your abilities.
5. Cultural differences: Quebec has a unique culture and work environment that may be different from what you're used to. Be prepared to adapt to these cultural differences and be open-minded about the working style and communication styles of Quebecers.
6. Job listings in French: Many job listings in Quebec are posted in French, which can make it difficult for non-French speakers to find job opportunities. Consider using job search websites that translate job listings into English, or use a translation tool to help you understand the job requirements and application process.
7. Lack of resources: As a beginner, you may not have access to the same resources as more experienced job seekers. Look for organizations that provide job seeker support, such as career centers, job fairs, and networking events.
