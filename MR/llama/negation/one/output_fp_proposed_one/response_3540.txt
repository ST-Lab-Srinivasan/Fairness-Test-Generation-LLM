Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-romantic partners (NRPs) and individuals who are not in a relationship can be achieved by incorporating them into the celebration's planning and execution. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve NRPs in the planning process: Invite NRPs to participate in the planning of cultural celebrations, such as selecting music, decorations, and activities. This will make them feel included and valued.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is in a romantic relationship. Instead, use language that is inclusive of all individuals, such as "all are welcome" or "everyone is invited."
3. Provide options for non-romantic partners: Offer activities and events that cater to NRPs, such as cultural workshops, game nights, or movie nights. This will allow them to participate in the celebration without feeling left out.
4. Avoid assumptions: Refrain from assuming that everyone is in a romantic relationship. Instead, ask individuals about their preferred celebration style and what they would like to participate in.
5. Foster a sense of community: Create an atmosphere where all individuals feel welcome and included. Encourage mingling and socializing among participants, and provide opportunities for people to get to know each other.
6. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be respectful of the cultural practices and beliefs of NRPs, and avoid imposing one's own cultural beliefs on them.
7. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as posters, flyers, or social media posts to promote the celebration and provide information about what to expect. This will help NRPs feel more comfortable and prepared.
8. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for NRPs, such as providing gender-neutral restrooms or ensuring that there are no assumptions made about people's relationships.
9. Be open to feedback: Be receptive to feedback from NRPs regarding the celebration and make adjustments accordingly. This will help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.
10. Emphasize mutual respect: Encourage mutual respect among all participants, regardless of their relationship status. This will help
