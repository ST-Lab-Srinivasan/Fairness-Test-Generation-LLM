Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong non-single beginner English speakers. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence an individual's identity:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For example, a person who grows up speaking Spanish at home and learns English in school may feel a strong connection to their Latino heritage and culture, even if they are also proficient in English.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals form their identities, including their values, beliefs, and behaviors. For example, someone who grows up in a traditional Korean household may adopt certain cultural practices and beliefs that are important to their identity as a Korean person.
3. Self-expression: Cultural heritage can be a source of self-expression for individuals, allowing them to express themselves through language, music, art, and other forms of cultural expression. For example, a person who identifies as African American may use jazz music as a way to express their cultural identity and connect with their community.
4. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of an individual's identity, such as race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. For example, a person who identifies as both Asian American and queer may find that their cultural heritage influences their experiences of marginalization and oppression in different ways.
5. Resilience: Cultural heritage can provide individuals with a sense of resilience and strength in the face of adversity. For example, a person who grows up in a multicultural community may learn to appreciate the diversity of their cultural background and use it as a source of strength in challenging situations.
6. Nostalgia: Cultural heritage can evoke feelings of nostalgia and longing for the past. For example, a person who grows up speaking Cantonese at home may feel nostalgic for their childhood when they were surrounded by their cultural heritage.
7. Preservation: Cultural heritage can be a way to preserve cultural traditions and practices for future generations. For example, a person who learns traditional African dances as a child may pass those traditions down to their own children and grandchildren.
8. Community building:
