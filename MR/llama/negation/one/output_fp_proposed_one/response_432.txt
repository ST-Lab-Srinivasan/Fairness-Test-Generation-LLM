As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that creating inclusive community events for any group of people requires careful consideration and planning. However, here are some general suggestions on how to create more inclusive community events for beginner non-Spanish speaker elite upper-class people:

1. Clear communication: Make sure all event materials, including flyers, posters, and invitations, are translated into multiple languages, including English, to cater to a diverse audience. Use simple language and avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-Spanish speakers.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for people with disabilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
3. Inclusive programming: Offer a variety of activities that cater to different interests and preferences, such as cultural workshops, art exhibitions, or musical performances. Provide opportunities for participants to engage in interactive and immersive experiences that promote cultural exchange and understanding.
4. Diverse staffing: Ensure that the event staff, including volunteers and organizers, reflects the diversity of the attendees. This can help create a welcoming atmosphere and address any concerns or issues that may arise during the event.
5. Flexibility: Be prepared to accommodate different communication styles and preferences, such as sign language interpretation or audio descriptions, depending on the needs of the participants.
6. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing power dynamics that may be detrimental to marginalized groups. Instead, focus on creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
7. Education and training: Provide training for event staff and volunteers on cultural competency, accessibility, and inclusivity to ensure they are equipped to handle diverse participants. This can also help build a more informed and empathetic community.
8. Inclusive marketing: Use marketing materials that are visually appealing and inclusive, avoiding language or imagery that may be offensive or alienating to any group of people. Promote the event through various channels, including social media, email, and local newspapers, to ensure a diverse audience is reached.
