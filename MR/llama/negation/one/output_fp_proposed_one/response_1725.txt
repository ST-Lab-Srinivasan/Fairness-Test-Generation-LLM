Creating more inclusive cultural programs for monastic non-Buddhist, non-millionaire individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the program is accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial status. Consider offering scholarships or financial aid to those who cannot afford the full cost of participation.
2. Diverse representation: Make sure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the community, including individuals from different racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds.
3. Inclusive programming: Offer programs that cater to a wide range of interests and needs, such as meditation, yoga, art, music, dance, and other creative expressions.
4. Partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations that serve diverse populations, such as community centers, schools, and non-profit groups. This can help reach a broader audience and create more inclusive cultural programs.
5. Outreach and marketing: Use various outreach and marketing strategies to promote the program, including social media, flyers, posters, and word of mouth. Make sure the messaging is clear and inclusive, highlighting the benefits of participation for all individuals.
6. Flexibility: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate different schedules and needs, such as evening or weekend programs, or online courses with live sessions.
7. Intergenerational programming: Include programs that bring together people of different ages, backgrounds, and abilities, fostering intergenerational connections and learning.
8. Accessible venues: Choose venues that are accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities. Ensure that the space is wheelchair-friendly, has accessible restrooms, and provides appropriate seating and acoustics for different types of cultural programs.
9. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds and beliefs of all participants. Avoid cultural appropriation or insensitive programming, and instead strive to create inclusive spaces where everyone feels valued and respected.
10. Continuous evaluation and improvement: Regularly assess the program's inclusivity and make adjustments as needed based on feedback from participants. Encourage open communication and constructive criticism
