Creating more inclusive social policies for non-high-income, non-divorced individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Addressing the gender pay gap: Non-high-income individuals, particularly women, often face significant barriers to economic mobility due to gender-based wage discrimination.
