There are several ways to ensure that the housing needs of non-temporary worker late 30s individuals are met:

1. Increase the supply of affordable housing: Governments can increase the supply of affordable housing by building more low-cost homes, apartments, and condominiums. This can be achieved through public-private partnerships or by providing incentives to developers who build affordable housing.
2. Implement rent control policies: Rent control policies can help keep rents affordable for non-temporary workers late 30s individuals who may not have the financial means to pay high rents. This can be achieved through local ordinances or state laws that regulate rent increases.
