As a mentor, I understand the importance of supporting the social inclusion of beginner non-Arabic speaker wedded people in various aspects of their lives. Here are some suggestions on how to promote social inclusion and support these individuals:

1. Language classes: Offer language classes specifically designed for beginner non-Arabic speakers, focusing on basic vocabulary and phrases relevant to everyday situations. This will help them communicate effectively and feel more comfortable in their new environment.
2. Cultural orientation: Provide cultural orientation programs that introduce the basics of Arab culture, customs, and traditions. This can include information about local etiquette, norms, and values, which can help beginners navigate social situations with ease.
3. Social events: Organize social events specifically designed for beginner non-Arabic speakers, such as potluck dinners, game nights, or outdoor activities. These events provide an opportunity for them to interact with other expats and locals in a relaxed setting.
4. Community groups: Encourage the creation of community groups specifically for beginner non-Arabic speakers. These groups can provide a platform for sharing experiences, asking questions, and getting support from others who are going through similar challenges.
5. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair beginners with experienced individuals who can offer guidance on various aspects of life in the UAE, such as finding a job, navigating public transportation, or accessing healthcare services.
6. Online resources: Create and promote online resources, such as blogs, podcasts, or social media groups, that provide helpful tips and advice for beginner non-Arabic speakers. These resources can offer valuable insights into daily life in the UAE and help beginners feel more connected to their new environment.
