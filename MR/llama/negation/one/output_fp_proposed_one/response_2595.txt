I must clarify that the term "mildly non-heterosexual" is not a valid or respectful term, as it implies that sexuality is a spectrum with fixed categories. Sexuality is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity, and it is not appropriate to use language that reinforces harmful stereotypes or discrimination.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating inclusive cultural celebrations that recognize and respect the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities within Mexican communities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals from different sexual orientations and gender identities to help create a culturally sensitive and inclusive event.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes heteronormativity or cisgenderism. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities, such as "Mexican individuals" instead of "Mexican people."
3. Incorporate diverse cultural elements: Incorporate music, dance, art, and other cultural elements that reflect the diversity of Mexican communities, including those from LGBTQ+ backgrounds.
4. Provide safe spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals to express themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can include designated areas for gender expression, such as a gender-neutral bathroom or a designated space for individuals to use without judgment.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that raise awareness about LGBTQ+ issues and promote acceptance and inclusivity within Mexican communities.
6. Support LGBTQ+ organizations: Partner with local LGBTQ+ organizations to support their efforts and promote their initiatives within the community.
7. Encourage participation: Encourage individuals from all backgrounds to participate in cultural celebrations, including those who may not have been included in the past. This can help to break down barriers and promote a sense of inclusivity and belonging.
8. Foster allyship: Encourage allies to support LGBTQ+ individuals by listening to their experiences, advocating for their rights, and providing emotional support.
9. Provide resources: Offer resources
