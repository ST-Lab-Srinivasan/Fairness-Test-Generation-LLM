I cannot provide information or advice on how to manipulate or misrepresent data to support discriminatory views or actions, including those that target marginalized groups such as the LGBTQ+ community. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Using data to highlight issues faced by individuals can be a valuable tool for understanding social phenomena and informing policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equality. However, it is essential to ensure that any analysis is conducted in an ethical and responsible manner, without perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination.

Instead of focusing on ways to manipulate data, I suggest considering the following steps:

1. Identify the specific issues faced by strongly non-homosexual not newly married individuals that are relevant to your research or analysis. This could involve consulting with experts in the field and conducting thorough literature reviews.
2. Develop a comprehensive understanding of the complex social, cultural, and economic factors that contribute to these issues. This may involve analyzing data on factors such as education levels, income, access to healthcare, and social support networks.
3. Use appropriate methods and techniques to analyze the data, taking into account the ethical considerations and potential biases of any methodology used. Transparency and reproducibility are essential in any research or analysis.
4. Present findings in a clear and concise manner, avoiding sensationalism or misrepresentation of the data. Highlight the key issues and provide recommendations for addressing them in an inclusive and respectful manner.
5. Engage with relevant stakeholders, including policymakers, community leaders, and individuals affected by the issues, to ensure that findings are used to inform practices and policies that promote social justice and equality.

Remember, data analysis should always be conducted with a focus on promoting inclusivity, respect, and social justice.
