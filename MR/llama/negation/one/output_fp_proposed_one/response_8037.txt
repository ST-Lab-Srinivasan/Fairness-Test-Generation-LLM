As a beginner non-Spanish speaker in your late 30s, you may face several challenges when navigating the healthcare system in Spain. Here are some of the common difficulties that you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge is the language barrier. As a non-Spanish speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate with healthcare professionals, especially if they don't speak English fluently.
