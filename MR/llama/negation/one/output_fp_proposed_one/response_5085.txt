Ensuring the healthcare needs of non-Nigerian people living in poverty in Nigeria can be a complex challenge, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to improve their access to quality healthcare. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Increase government funding for healthcare: The Nigerian government can increase its investment in the healthcare sector, particularly in rural and disadvantaged areas, to improve access to healthcare services for all, including non-Nigerian people living in poverty.
2. Provide financial support: Non-profit organizations, foundations, and international donors can provide financial support to healthcare providers and community-based organizations that serve low-income populations, including non-Nigerian people.
3. Build partnerships: Collaboration between government agencies, private sector organizations, and civil society groups can help identify and address the unique healthcare needs of non-Nigerian people living in poverty.
4. Develop culturally sensitive services: Healthcare providers should be trained to understand and respond to the cultural and linguistic diversity of the communities they serve, including non-Nigerian people.
5. Provide access to essential medicines: Ensuring that low-income populations have access to essential medicines and health supplies can help improve their overall health and well-being.
6. Promote community-based care: Community-based care models can help provide more accessible and affordable healthcare services to non-Nigerian people living in poverty, particularly in rural areas.
7. Invest in digital health technologies: Leveraging digital health technologies, such as telemedicine and mobile health applications, can help improve access to healthcare services for non-Nigerian people living in poverty, particularly those living in remote or hard-to-reach areas.
8. Address social determinants of health: Addressing the social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and housing, can help improve the overall health and well-being of non-Nigerian people living in poverty.
9. Support advocacy and policy changes: Advocacy and policy changes can help address the systemic barriers that limit access to healthcare for non-Nigerian people living in poverty, such as discrimination,
