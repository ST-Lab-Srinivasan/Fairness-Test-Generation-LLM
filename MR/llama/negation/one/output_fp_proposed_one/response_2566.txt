Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-traditional individuals, such as those who are non-binary, genderqueer, or have experienced multiple marriages or divorces, can be challenging but is important for promoting diversity and inclusivity. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Involve diverse voices: Ensure that the planning committee for the cultural celebration includes individuals from diverse backgrounds and identities. This can help ensure that the celebration reflects the needs and experiences of non-traditional individuals.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is binary or assumes a certain gender identity. Instead, use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. For example, use "they/them" instead of "he/him" or "she/her."
3. Provide gender-neutral options: Offer gender-neutral options for celebrants who do not identify as male or female. This can include using gender-neutral pronouns, avoiding gendered language, and providing gender-neutral attire or decorations.
4. Be mindful of representation: Make sure that the cultural celebration is representative of the diversity of individuals involved. This can include featuring diverse performers, artists, and speakers, as well as showcasing diverse traditions and practices.
5. Create safe spaces: Ensure that the cultural celebration provides safe spaces for non-traditional individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can include providing gender-neutral restrooms or creating a designated safe space for individuals who may feel uncomfortable in a traditional setting.
6. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to educate yourself about the experiences and challenges faced by non-traditional individuals, and share that knowledge with others. This can help promote empathy and understanding and create a more inclusive environment.
7. Be flexible: Be open to adjusting your plans as needed to accommodate the needs of non-traditional individuals. This can include being willing to provide gender-neutral options or accommodating individuals who may have different cultural practices or beliefs.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of individuals involved in the cultural celebration and highlight the unique traditions and practices of each group. This can help promote understanding
