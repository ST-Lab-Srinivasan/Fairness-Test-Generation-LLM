Ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-Nigerian lower-class people are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including access, affordability, quality of care, and social determinants of health. Here are some potential strategies to consider:

1. Increase access to healthcare facilities: Non-Nigerian lower-class people may face barriers in accessing healthcare facilities due to distance, transportation costs, or lack of knowledge about available services. Strategies could include establishing more healthcare facilities in underserved areas, providing transportation assistance, or launching public education campaigns to raise awareness about available services.
2. Improve affordability: Many lower-class people may struggle to pay for healthcare services due to financial constraints. Governments can implement policies to reduce out-of-pocket expenses, such as subsidizing care or implementing social insurance programs.
3. Enhance quality of care: Lower-class people may receive lower quality of care due to limited access to resources and specialized expertise. Strategies could involve investing in training for healthcare providers, improving infrastructure, or implementing quality improvement initiatives.
4. Address social determinants of health: Social factors such as poverty, education level, and living conditions can significantly impact health outcomes. Addressing these social determinants through policies aimed at reducing poverty, improving access to education, and promoting safe living conditions can help improve overall health.
5. Promote community-based care: Community-based care models can help reach lower-class populations that may have limited access to formal healthcare facilities. This could involve mobilizing community health workers, promoting home visits, or establishing community clinics.
6. Leverage technology: Telemedicine and other digital health technologies can help expand access to care for lower-class people living in remote or underserved areas. These interventions can also help reduce costs by minimizing the need for travel and facility infrastructure.
7. Strengthen collaboration between stakeholders: Collaboration between governments, NGOs, private sector actors, and community groups is crucial for addressing the healthcare needs of non-Nigerian lower-class people. This could involve jointly developing policies, sharing resources, or coordinating
