Creating inclusive community events for non-active duty beginner Arabic speakers requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpreters or translators at the event to help non-Arabic speakers follow along with presentations, announcements, and other communications. You can also provide written materials in both Arabic and English to cater to a wider audience.
2. Make it accessible: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible, has enough seating, and provides appropriate lighting and sound accommodations for attendees with disabilities.
3. Offer childcare services: Recognize that attending events can be challenging for parents or caregivers who need to find suitable childcare. Consider partnering with local organizations that provide childcare services during the event, or designating a quiet area where children can play and learn while their parents attend.
4. Create an inclusive atmosphere: Use visual aids and multimedia presentations to engage attendees and make the content more accessible. Use a diverse range of speakers and performers to showcase the various cultures and backgrounds represented in the community.
5. Provide cultural immersion experiences: Offer opportunities for attendees to learn about Arab culture through interactive activities, such as cooking demonstrations, traditional music performances, or calligraphy workshops. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and allow non-Arabic speakers to connect with the community on a deeper level.
6. Promote the event widely: Utilize social media platforms, local newspapers, and community newsletters to promote the event and reach a wider audience. Consider partnering with local organizations or community groups to help spread the word and attract more attendees.
7. Offer language classes: Provide language classes specifically designed for non-active duty beginner Arabic speakers. This can be done in partnership with local language schools or community centers, and can help attendees feel more comfortable and confident during the event.
8. Encourage audience participation: Plan interactive activities that allow attendees to participate and engage with the content, such as Q&A sessions, group discussions, or role-playing exercises
