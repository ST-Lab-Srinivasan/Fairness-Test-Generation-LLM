3. Support entrepreneurship and innovation: Wealthy solo individuals often have innovative ideas and the resources to turn them into successful businesses. Policies that support entrepreneurship and innovation can help them create jobs, drive economic growth, and contribute to their communities.
4. Address social isolation: Wealthy solo individuals may face social isolation due to their wealth and lifestyle choices. Policies that promote social connection and community engagement can help combat this issue and ensure they are not socially disconnected from others.
