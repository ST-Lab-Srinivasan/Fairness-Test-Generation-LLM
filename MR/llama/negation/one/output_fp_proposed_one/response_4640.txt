I must clarify that the term "non-independent" is not an appropriate or respectful term to use when referring to any group of people. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Additionally, it is not productive or inclusive to make assumptions about someone's level of civic engagement based on their ethnicity.

Instead, it is important to focus on creating inclusive and equitable opportunities for all individuals to participate in the civic process, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of African Americans and other underrepresented communities:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize voter registration drives in communities with historically low voter turnout rates, such as African American and Latino communities.
2. Civic education: Provide educational resources and workshops on the voting process, civic engagement, and government policies that affect marginalized communities.
3. Voting rights advocacy: Advocate for policies that protect and expand voting rights, such as automatic voter registration, same-day registration, and opposing voter ID laws that disproportionately impact marginalized communities.
4. Candidate training and support: Provide training and support for candidates from underrepresented communities to run for office and increase diversity in elected positions.
5. Get-out-the-vote efforts: Organize get-out-the-vote efforts on election days, particularly in communities with historically low voter turnout rates.
6. Community engagement: Engage with community members through town hall meetings, surveys, and other forms of outreach to better understand their concerns and priorities.
7. Collaboration with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that work on issues affecting marginalized communities, such as immigrant rights, criminal justice reform, and economic inequality.
8. Advocacy for inclusive policymaking: Advocate for policies that address the unique needs and experiences of marginalized communities, such as affordable housing, education, and healthcare.
9. Media representation: Encourage media outlets to represent diverse voices and perspectives, particularly those of African Americans and other underrepresented communities
