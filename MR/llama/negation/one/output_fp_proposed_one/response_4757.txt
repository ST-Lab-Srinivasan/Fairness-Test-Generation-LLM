There are several challenges that individuals from non-Caucasian ethnic and racial backgrounds may face in the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of their region or country may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
