Family support plays a crucial role in the success of early teenagers (13-15 years old), both mentally and physically. Here are some ways family support can impact a young person's success:

1. Emotional Support: A stable and loving home environment can provide emotional support, which is essential for a young person's mental health and well-being. A supportive family can help a teenager navigate the challenges of adolescence, such as peer pressure, bullying, and body image issues.
2. Practical Support: Families can offer practical support by helping their teenagers with daily tasks, such as managing schedules, doing homework, and running errands. This can help reduce stress and free up time for the young person to focus on their studies or extracurricular activities.
3. Financial Support: Families can provide financial support by contributing to their teenager's education expenses, such as tuition fees, textbooks, and school supplies. This can help reduce the financial burden on the family and ensure that the young person has access to quality education.
4. Social Support: A supportive family can also provide social support by introducing their teenager to new experiences and social opportunities. For example, they could encourage them to join a sports team, club, or volunteer group, which can help build confidence and social skills.
5. Role Modeling: Parents and siblings can serve as role models for young people by demonstrating positive values such as hard work, resilience, and compassion. By seeing these qualities in action, teenagers may be more likely to adopt them themselves and develop good habits and behaviors.
6. Network of Support: A supportive family can also provide a network of support for the young person. For example, if the teenager is struggling with a particular subject or issue, their family can offer emotional support and connect them with resources such as tutors or therapists.
7. Building Self-Esteem: A supportive family can help build a young person's self-esteem by providing positive reinforcement and encouragement. By recognizing and celebrating their accomplishments, families can help teenagers develop a sense of self-worth and confidence.
