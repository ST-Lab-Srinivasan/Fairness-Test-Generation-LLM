This can be achieved by incorporating a wide range of perspectives and voices in the curriculum, including those from marginalized communities.

3. Active Learning: Encourage active learning by providing opportunities for students to engage in discussions, debates, and problem-solving activities. This can help foster critical thinking and promote a deeper understanding of complex issues.
4. Inclusive Assessments: Develop assessments that are inclusive of all students' perspectives and voices. This can involve using a variety of assessment tools, such as written assignments, group projects, and presentations, to evaluate student learning.
5. Support Services: Provide support services, such as counseling and academic advising, to help non-elderly male non-libertarian students who may be struggling academically or personally.
6. Cultural Competence: Train teachers and educators in cultural competence to better understand and address the unique needs of diverse student populations. This can involve providing professional development opportunities on topics such as diversity, equity, and inclusion.
7. Family Engagement: Encourage family engagement by providing opportunities for parents and guardians to participate in educational activities and decision-making processes. This can help build a supportive learning environment for all students.
8. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with community organizations and businesses to provide students with real-world learning experiences and to promote social mobility.
