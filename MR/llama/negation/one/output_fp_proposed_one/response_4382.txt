Creating more inclusive community events for non-active duty, non-upper middle-income people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and inclusive:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the challenges that may prevent marginalized groups from attending events. For example, childcare responsibilities, transportation issues, or financial constraints. Once you identify these barriers, develop solutions to address them.
2. Inclusive marketing: Make sure your event marketing materials are inclusive and accessible to all. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of diverse groups. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-active duty, non-upper middle-income people.
3. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities at your event to engage with the local community. This can include recruiting volunteers from local organizations that serve marginalized groups.
4. Scholarships and financial aid: Consider offering scholarships or financial aid to non-active duty, non-upper middle-income people who may face financial constraints in attending events. You can also partner with local organizations that provide financial assistance to marginalized communities.
5. Accessibility features: Ensure that your event space is accessible and inclusive for all attendees. This can include providing wheelchair accessibility, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
6. Community outreach: Engage with local community organizations that serve marginalized groups. Partner with them to promote your event and involve their members in the planning process.
7. Intersectional programming: Incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences into your event programming. This can include panels, workshops, or performances that showcase the stories and talents of marginalized communities.
8. Childcare support: Offer childcare services or provide a designated area for children to play while their parents attend the event. This can help remove a significant barrier for families with young children.
9. Flexible pricing options: Consider offering flexible pricing options, such as sliding scale fees or pay-what-you-can models. This can make your event more accessible to people who
