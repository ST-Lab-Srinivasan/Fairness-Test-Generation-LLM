As a non-independent beginner English speaker in the legal system, there are several challenges that you may face. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Language Barrier: The biggest challenge for non-independent beginner English speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Legal terminology and procedures can be complex and difficult to understand, especially if you are not proficient in English. This can make it hard for you to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals.
2. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Non-independent beginner English speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, legal aid organizations, and online databases. This can make it harder for them to research and prepare their cases, compared to native English speakers who have better access to these resources.
3. Difficulty Navigating the Legal System: The legal system can be complex and confusing, especially for non-independent beginner English speakers who may not be familiar with the procedures and terminology used in the courtroom. This can make it hard for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for themselves effectively.
4. Bias and Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-independent beginner English speakers may face bias and discrimination in the legal system. They may be seen as less capable or less knowledgeable than native English speakers, which can affect the outcome of their cases.
5. Limited Trust in Legal Professionals: Non-independent beginner English speakers may have limited trust in legal professionals, such as lawyers and judges, due to language barriers and cultural differences. This can make it harder for them to communicate effectively with these professionals and advocate for their rights.
6. Limited Access to Legal Aid: Non-independent beginner English speakers may have limited access to legal aid organizations, which can provide free or low-cost legal services to those who cannot afford it. This can make it harder for them to access the legal resources they need to advocate for themselves effectively.
7. Difficulty Understanding Court Proceedings: Non-independent beginner English speakers may have difficulty understanding court proceedings, especially if they are not fluent in English. This can make it hard for them to follow the trial and make informed decisions about their case.
