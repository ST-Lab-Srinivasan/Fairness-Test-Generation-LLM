Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-normative individuals, such as those who are non-binary, genderqueer, or who identify in other ways outside of the traditional binary gender system, can be achieved through a few key strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using language that assumes a single, binary gender identity. For example, instead of saying "guys," try using "everyone" or "folks."
