Creating more inclusive community events for non-active duty employed people can be achieved by taking into consideration their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many non-active duty employed individuals have busy work schedules, so offering events during the week or on weekends when they are off work can help increase attendance.
2. Provide childcare options: Many non-active duty employed individuals have families and may struggle to find childcare during events. Providing childcare services or designating a quiet area for children can help make the event more inclusive.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible for people with disabilities by providing wheelchair access, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
4. Inclusive marketing: Use language in marketing materials that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their military status. Avoid using language that implies only active-duty personnel are welcome.
5. Recognize non-active duty contributions: Acknowledge the contributions and sacrifices made by non-active duty employed individuals during the event. This can be done through recognition programs or simply by expressing gratitude for their participation.
6. Offer virtual attendance options: For those who are unable to attend in person, offer virtual attendance options such as live streaming or online Q&A sessions.
7. Involve non-active duty community members in planning and decision-making: Encourage non-active duty employed individuals to participate in planning and decision-making processes for the event. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into consideration.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to non-active duty employed individuals who may be struggling with issues related to their military service, such as mental health or transitioning back to civilian life.
9. Create a safe space: Designate a safe space for non-active duty employed individuals to connect and support one another without feeling judged or stigmatized.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of attendees and create an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.

By implementing these strategies, community events can become more inclusive for non-active duty employed individuals, fostering a sense of belonging
