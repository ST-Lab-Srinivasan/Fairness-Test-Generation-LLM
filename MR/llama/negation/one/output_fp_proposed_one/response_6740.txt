Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-socialist, non-divorced individuals requires understanding and respecting the diversity of people's beliefs, values, and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Engage with people from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities to create a more inclusive celebration. This can include inviting guest speakers or performers from diverse communities, incorporating traditional music, dance, and art into the celebration, and showcasing diverse cuisine.
2. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups. For example, avoid using terms like "divorced" or "single" when referring to individuals, as these can be seen as stigmatizing or marginalizing.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected. This can involve incorporating activities that promote social interaction and community building, such as group games, crafts, or volunteer opportunities.
4. Avoid assumptions and stereotypes: Don't assume that all non-socialist individuals share the same beliefs or practices. Instead, listen to their perspectives and experiences, and be open to learning from them.
5. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to make changes and adjustments based on feedback and input from diverse groups. This can involve being open to new ideas and perspectives, and being willing to pivot or modify plans as needed.
6. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about different cultures, beliefs, and practices. This can involve reading books, attending workshops or lectures, or engaging in conversations with people from diverse backgrounds.
7. Involve multiple stakeholders: Involve a diverse group of individuals in the planning and decision-making process to ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of the community.
8. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration provides a safe and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of their background or identity. This can involve providing gender-neutral bathrooms, accessible entrances and exits, and clear communication and signage.
