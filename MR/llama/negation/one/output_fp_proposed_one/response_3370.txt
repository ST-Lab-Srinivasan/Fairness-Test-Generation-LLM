Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed Asian heritage devout non-Christian individuals requires a thoughtful and respectful approach that acknowledges and values their diverse backgrounds and beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Consult with members of the mixed Asian heritage community to understand their preferences and concerns. Involve them in the planning process to ensure that the celebrations are inclusive and respectful of their beliefs and practices.
2. Learn about their traditions: Take the time to learn about the cultural and religious traditions of each community represented. This will help you avoid cultural faux pas and ensure that the celebrations are sensitive to their needs.
3. Be mindful of language: Avoid using language or terminology that is offensive or insensitive to any particular group. Use inclusive language that respects the diversity of the community.
4. Offer vegetarian options: Many non-Christian Asian cultures have dietary restrictions, so it's important to offer vegetarian options for food and drinks. This will ensure that everyone feels included and catered to.
5. Incorporate diverse music and dance: Include music and dance from different Asian cultures in the celebrations. This will add depth and diversity to the cultural experience and make it more inclusive.
6. Respect religious practices: Make sure to accommodate the religious practices of each community, such as providing a quiet room for prayer or meditation. Be mindful of the dress code and avoid imposing any particular dress code on the community.
7. Create a diverse program: Develop a program that includes a variety of cultural activities, such as traditional dances, music performances, and art exhibitions. This will help create a more inclusive and diverse cultural experience.
8. Engage in interfaith dialogue: Organize interfaith dialogues or discussions that bring together members of different religious communities to share their beliefs and practices. This can help build bridges of understanding and respect between different cultures and religions.
9. Provide translation services: Offer translation services for those who may not speak the dominant language of the community. This will ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy the celebrations without barriers.
