9. Foster creativity and innovation: Encourage students to think creatively and develop innovative solutions to real-world problems through projects and competitions.
10. Celebrate successes: Recognize and celebrate the achievements of individuals from diverse backgrounds, highlighting their accomplishments as role models for others.
