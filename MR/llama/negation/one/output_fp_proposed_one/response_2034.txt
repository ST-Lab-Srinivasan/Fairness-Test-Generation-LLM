Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically full non-Hispanics requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Understand the audience: It is essential to understand the needs, preferences, and cultural backgrounds of the target audience. Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather information about their interests, language proficiency level, and cultural expectations.
2. Incorporate diverse content: Design cultural programs that include a variety of perspectives, experiences, and traditions. This can be achieved by incorporating music, art, literature, and historical events from different Spanish-speaking countries and communities.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes non-Hispanic individuals. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures.
4. Provide interpretation and translation services: Offer interpretation and translation services for non-Spanish speakers who may not be fluent in the language. This can help ensure that everyone can participate and understand the content.
5. Create a safe space: Establish a comfortable and inclusive environment where participants feel free to share their thoughts and experiences without fear of judgment or discrimination.
6. Foster collaboration: Encourage collaboration between participants from different cultural backgrounds. This can help build bridges of understanding and foster a sense of community and mutual respect.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in the cultural program. Be sensitive to the experiences and perspectives of non-Hispanic individuals and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or marginalizing them.
8. Involve diverse instructors: Hire instructors who are from diverse backgrounds and cultures. This can help ensure that the cultural program is representative of the community it serves.
9. Offer flexible scheduling options: Accommodate the schedules of participants by offering flexible scheduling options, such as online or evening classes.
10. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate the cultural program's inclusivity and effectiveness. Solicit feedback from participants and make necessary adjustments to create a more inclusive and engaging experience.
