To promote the accessibility of public services for beginner non-French speaker active-duty individuals, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Provide multilingual support: Offer support in multiple languages, including English and other common languages spoken by military personnel. This can include providing interpreters or translators, as well as offering written materials in multiple languages.
2. Use plain language: Avoid using complex legal or technical terms that may be difficult for non-French speakers to understand. Instead, use plain language that is easy to understand for everyone.
3. Offer cultural orientation: Provide information on French culture and customs to help military personnel better navigate the system and understand the local way of life.
4. Use technology: Leverage technology to provide accessible services, such as online portals or mobile apps that can be used by non-French speakers.
5. Train staff: Provide training for staff on how to interact with beginner non-French speaker active-duty individuals, including understanding cultural differences and communication styles.
6. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures or videos to help explain complex concepts or processes, which can be especially helpful for non-French speakers who may have difficulty understanding written language.
7. Offer additional support: Provide additional support services, such as language classes or cultural orientation programs, to help military personnel improve their French language skills and cultural knowledge.
8. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that public services are provided in a welcoming and inclusive environment, where non-French speakers feel comfortable asking questions or seeking assistance.
9. Use accessible communication channels: Utilize accessible communication channels such as braille, large print, or audio descriptions for individuals with disabilities who may have difficulty accessing written or visual information.
10. Regularly evaluate and improve services: Regularly evaluate the accessibility of public services and gather feedback from non-French speakers to identify areas for improvement and ensure that services are continuously improving.

By taking these steps, beginner non-French speaker active-duty individuals can have a better experience when accessing public services in France.
