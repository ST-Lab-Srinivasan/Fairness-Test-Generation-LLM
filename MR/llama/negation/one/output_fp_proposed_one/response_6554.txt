Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speaker non-middle-class income people requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Use simple language and clear instructions: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be difficult for beginner English speakers to understand. Provide clear instructions on how to participate and what to expect during the event.
2. Offer translation support: Provide translation support, such as interpretation services or written materials in multiple languages, to help non-English speakers participate.
3. Make accessibility a priority: Ensure that your event location is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
4. Offer free or low-cost events: Non-middle-class income people may have limited financial resources. Offering free or low-cost events can help make them more inclusive and accessible to a wider range of people.
5. Promote your event through multiple channels: Reach out to local community organizations, schools, and social media groups to promote your event. This can help attract a diverse audience and ensure that beginner English speakers know about the event.
6. Provide childcare options: Many non-middle-class income people may have children who are not yet in school. Providing childcare options during the event can help make it more accessible to them.
7. Offer flexible participation options: Allow participants to participate in the event in different ways, such as via video conference or by providing pre-recorded content that can be accessed before or after the event.
8. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Ensure that your event creates a safe and inclusive environment for all participants. Encourage respectful communication, listen to diverse perspectives, and avoid any form of discrimination or harassment.
9. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for your event organizers and participants to help them understand and appreciate different cultures and backgrounds.
10. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate your events and gather feedback from participants to identify areas of improvement. Use this information to make necessary changes to create a more inclusive and accessible community event.
