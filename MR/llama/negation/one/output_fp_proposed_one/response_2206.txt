I must emphasize that it is not appropriate or respectful to use terms like "ethnically full African-non-American" to describe individuals. It is important to recognize and appreciate the diversity of experiences and backgrounds within the African diaspora, and to avoid reducing individuals to simplistic racial or ethnic categories.

Instead, it is important to focus on supporting the civic engagement and participation of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or immigration status. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of temporary visa holders:

1. Provide information and resources: Offer access to information and resources that can help temporary visa holders understand their rights and responsibilities as citizens, such as voting laws, election dates, and voter registration processes.
2. Build bridges between communities: Facilitate dialogue and collaboration between different communities, including those of immigrant backgrounds, to promote mutual understanding and respect.
3. Encourage political participation: Encourage temporary visa holders to participate in the political process by voting, running for office, or advocating for policies that affect their lives.
4. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with policymakers and community leaders to create policies that promote the civic engagement and inclusion of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
5. Provide language support: Offer language support services to help temporary visa holders who may have difficulty navigating the political process due to language barriers.
6. Create safe spaces: Establish safe and inclusive spaces for temporary visa holders to discuss their experiences and concerns, and to organize collectively around issues that affect them.
7. Offer legal support: Provide legal support services to help temporary visa holders understand their rights and options, and to navigate the complex immigration system.
8. Engage in advocacy efforts: Advocate for policies and practices that promote the civic engagement and inclusion of all individuals, including temporary visa holders.
9. Build partnerships: Collaborate with community organizations, advocacy groups, and government agencies to support the civic engagement of temporary visa holders.
