I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their religion, race, or socioeconomic status. Every individual has their own unique experiences, beliefs, and values, and it is important to treat them with dignity and respect regardless of their background.

It is also worth noting that the concept of "elite upper-class secular non-Jewish people" is a social construct that can be problematic as it can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination. It is important to recognize that people from all walks of life have the potential to achieve great things, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead of focusing on broad generalizations, it may be more productive to consider the specific factors that can influence an individual's success, such as access to education and opportunities, social support networks, and cultural norms. By understanding these factors and working to address any inequalities or barriers, we can help create a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
