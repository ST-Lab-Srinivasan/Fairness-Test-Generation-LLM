As a beginner Chinese speaker and a natural-born Indian non-citizen, there may be several challenges you may face in the legal system in China. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in China is primarily based on written documents, court proceedings, and legal interpretations, which can be challenging for beginners who are not fluent in Chinese. You may struggle to understand legal concepts, procedures, and terminology, which could lead to misunderstandings or miscommunication.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique legal culture that is different from India's legal system. Understanding the cultural nuances of the Chinese legal system can be challenging for foreigners who are not familiar with the local customs and practices.
3. Lack of legal knowledge: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may lack the legal knowledge and expertise to navigate the complexities of the Chinese legal system. You may struggle to understand the legal framework, procedures, and regulations that govern the system.
4. Limited access to legal resources: As a non-citizen, you may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, lawyers, and legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult for you to gather information and seek legal advice when needed.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, there have been reports of discrimination against foreigners in the Chinese legal system. You may face biases or prejudices from court officials, lawyers, or other legal professionals due to your nationality or immigration status.
6. Difficulty in finding legal representation: As a non-citizen, you may have limited access to legal representation in China. Finding a lawyer who is familiar with the legal system and can provide effective representation can be challenging, especially for those who do not speak Chinese fluently.
7. Limited understanding of local laws and regulations: The Chinese legal system has many complex and nuanced rules that can be difficult to understand for beginners. You may struggle to keep up with changes in the law or interpret local regulations correctly.
8. Difficulty in navigating the court system: Navigating the Chinese court system can be challenging for foreigners who are not familiar with the procedures and protocols. You may face difficulties in filing cases, submitting evidence, or attending court hearings
