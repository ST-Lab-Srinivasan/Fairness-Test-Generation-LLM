Creating more inclusive social policies for deep poverty and lifelong poverty is crucial to ensure that all individuals have access to the resources they need to lead a dignified life. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent individuals from escaping poverty, such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and limited access to healthcare.
2. Increasing access to education: Provide access to quality education for all individuals, including those living in poverty, to help them acquire the skills and knowledge needed to secure better-paying jobs.
3. Job training and placement: Offer job training programs that equip individuals with the skills necessary to compete in the job market. Additionally, provide placement services to connect individuals with job opportunities.
4. Microfinance programs: Implement microfinance programs that provide small loans or other financial services to individuals living in poverty. This can help them start or expand a business, which can generate income and improve their overall well-being.
5. Healthcare access: Ensure that all individuals have access to quality healthcare, including preventive care, to prevent illnesses and diseases that can exacerbate poverty.
6. Childcare support: Provide support for childcare costs to help families living in poverty, particularly those with young children, who may struggle to balance work and family responsibilities.
7. Housing support: Offer housing support programs, such as rent subsidies or homeownership assistance, to help individuals living in poverty secure affordable and safe housing.
8. Community development: Invest in community development programs that provide a range of services, including job training, healthcare, and childcare, to help individuals living in poverty access the resources they need to lead a dignified life.
9. Addressing discrimination: Implement policies and practices that address discrimination faced by marginalized groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals, which can contribute to deeper poverty.
10. Evaluating and adapting policies: Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of social policies and make adjustments
