1. Language barrier: The legal system in France is primarily conducted in French, which can create a significant challenge for non-native English speakers. This language barrier can make it difficult for them to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents.
2. Cultural differences: Legal systems vary across countries, and cultural differences may affect how non-native English speakers approach the legal system in France. For example, some legal concepts or practices may be unfamiliar to non-native speakers, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.

9. Difficulty understanding court procedures: The legal system in France has its own unique procedures and protocol
