Ensuring the educational needs of non-Arabic speaking students who have been widowed for an extended period of time can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to support these individuals. Here are some suggestions:

Provide Arabic language classes: Offering regular Arabic language classes specifically designed for non-Arabic speakers can help them acquire the language skills they need to succeed in their studies. These classes can cover basic vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, as well as provide opportunities for practice and feedback.
