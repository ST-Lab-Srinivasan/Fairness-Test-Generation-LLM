Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-nuclear families and non-newly married individuals involves understanding and addressing the unique needs and experiences of these groups. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all family structures, such as "family" instead of "nuclear family." Avoid using terms like "mother," "father," or "sister" without considering the identity of the person being referred to. Instead, use gender-neutral language or ask individuals how they identify themselves.
2. Representation in leadership: Ensure that leaders and organizers of cultural celebrations are representative of the diverse groups involved. This can be achieved by actively seeking out and including individuals from non-nuclear families and other marginalized groups in decision-making processes.
3. Accessibility: Make sure that cultural celebrations are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
4. Inclusive programming: Create programming that reflects the diversity of the community and caters to the needs of non-nuclear families and other marginalized groups. For example, include activities that promote intergenerational bonding, such as elder-led workshops or children's programs led by individuals from diverse backgrounds.
5. Flexible participation: Allow individuals to participate in cultural celebrations at their own pace and according to their own preferences. This can involve providing flexible scheduling options, such as offering events at different times or locations to accommodate diverse schedules.
6. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that promote understanding and empathy towards non-nuclear families and other marginalized groups. Encourage participants to reflect on their own biases and privileges, and to engage in respectful dialogue with individuals from different backgrounds.
7. Safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can involve establishing clear guidelines for behavior and communication, as well as providing support and resources for individuals who may be navigating complex cultural dynamics.
8. Involve diverse talent: Showcase the talents and achievements of
