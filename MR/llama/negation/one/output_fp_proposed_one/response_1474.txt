Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-independent lifelong single individuals requires recognizing and addressing the unique challenges they face. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Recognize singleness as a valid relationship status: Challenge societal norms that view marriage and partnership as the only legitimate relationship status. Embrace the diversity of relationships and acknowledge the value of singlehood.
2. Involve singles in planning and decision-making: Include singles in the planning process for cultural celebrations to ensure their needs and preferences are taken into account. This can be done by creating a diverse planning committee or involving singles in focus groups.
3. Provide accommodations for singles: Offer options for singles to participate in cultural celebrations without feeling pressure to find a partner. For example, provide single-friendly seating areas or offer activities that are accessible for singles.
4. Challenge gendered expectations: Many cultural celebrations have gendered expectations that can be alienating for singles who don't identify with traditional gender roles. Challenge these expectations by creating more inclusive and gender-neutral activities.
5. Emphasize the importance of community: Highlight the value of community and inclusivity during cultural celebrations. Encourage participants to connect with others and form new relationships, regardless of relationship status.
6. Offer mentorship opportunities: Provide mentorship opportunities for singles who may be looking for guidance on how to navigate cultural celebrations as a single person. This can be done through workshops or one-on-one mentoring sessions.
7. Create virtual participation options: For singles who may feel isolated or unable to participate in cultural celebrations due to location or mobility issues, create virtual participation options. This can include online events, video conferencing, or social media campaigns.
8. Address ableism and accessibility: Ensure that cultural celebrations are accessible to all participants, regardless of ability. Provide accommodations for participants with disabilities and challenge ableist attitudes within the planning process.
9. Emphasize the value of singleness: Highlight the unique benefits and experiences of being a single person during cultural celebrations. Encourage participants to embrace their singleness and find joy in their individuality.
