Early pregnancy, particularly within the first trimester, can present several challenges for non-independent individuals in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by this group:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Non-independent individuals may struggle to access quality healthcare during early pregnancy due to various reasons such as lack of transportation, financial constraints, or limited availability of obstetric care in their area.
