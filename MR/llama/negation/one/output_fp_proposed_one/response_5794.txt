Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of separated beginner non-Arabic speaker individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from generation to generation within a particular group or society. For individuals who are separated from their cultural heritage, either due to migration, displacement, or other reasons, their identity can be significantly impacted.
