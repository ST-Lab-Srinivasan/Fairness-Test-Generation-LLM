Creating more inclusive cultural programs for monastic non-Buddhist individuals from lower middle-income backgrounds requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural programs are accessible to all, regardless of their economic status. Offer flexible pricing options or free admission for those who cannot afford it.
2. Inclusive marketing: Use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful of diverse cultures and beliefs. Avoid stereotyping or tokenizing particular groups.
3. Diverse programming: Offer a variety of cultural programs that cater to different interests and preferences, such as music, dance, art, literature, and film. Ensure that the programs are representative of diverse cultures and perspectives.
4. Community engagement: Involve the local community in the cultural program's development and implementation. Encourage feedback and suggestions from diverse groups to ensure that the programs are inclusive and relevant.
5. Collaborations: Collaborate with organizations that serve marginalized communities, such as community centers, schools, and social service agencies. This can help to reach a broader audience and create more inclusive cultural programs.
6. Education and training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can help to ensure that the cultural programs are respectful and inclusive of all participants.
7. Safe spaces: Create safe and welcoming spaces for individuals from diverse backgrounds to participate in cultural programs. Ensure that the environments are free from discrimination, harassment, or marginalization.
8. Intersectional approach: Adopt an intersectional approach when developing cultural programs, considering the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class, and other factors that impact access to culture.
9. Partnerships with marginalized communities: Form partnerships with organizations that serve marginalized communities to co-create and co-deliver cultural programs. This can help to ensure that the programs are relevant and inclusive of diverse perspectives.
10. Evaluation and assessment: Regularly evaluate and assess the cultural programs to ensure that they are inclusive and effective in reaching their intended goals.
