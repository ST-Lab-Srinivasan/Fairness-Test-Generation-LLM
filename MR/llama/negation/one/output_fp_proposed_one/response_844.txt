Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, regardless of their cultural or religious background. Here are some potential impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of non-Jewish people:

1. Emotional and psychological effects: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, particularly when there is limited understanding or support from family, friends, or society at large. Non-Jewish individuals may face discrimination, stigma, or social isolation, which can exacerbate the emotional burden of their condition.

These barriers could include limited availability of specialized care, inadequate insurance coverage, or lack of access to diagnostic tests and treatments.
