Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are mixed African-non-Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the participants. This can include learning about the different cultures and traditions of the participants, as well as understanding the nuances of identity and belonging.
2. Inclusive programming: Develop cultural programs that are inclusive of all participants, regardless of their background or identity. This can include programs that celebrate diverse cultures, traditions, and languages, as well as programs that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
3. Participatory programming: Involve participants in the planning and implementation of cultural programs to ensure that they are inclusive and reflect their interests and needs. This can include participatory activities such as workshops, discussions, and creative projects.
4. Safe space creation: Create a safe and welcoming environment for all participants, free from discrimination and marginalization. This can involve setting clear expectations and guidelines for behavior, providing support and resources for participants, and fostering a sense of community and belonging.
5. Intersectionality awareness: Acknowledge and address the intersectional identities and experiences of participants, including their race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexuality, ability, and other factors. This can involve incorporating intersectional perspectives into cultural programs and activities, as well as providing support and resources for participants who may face additional barriers or challenges.
6. Collaboration with community organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations and cultural centers to develop cultural programs that are grounded in the needs and interests of the participants. This can involve partnering with organizations that serve diverse communities, as well as involving community leaders and experts in the development and implementation of cultural programs.
7. Flexibility and adaptability: Be flexible and adaptable in response to the changing needs and preferences of participants. This can involve continuously evaluating and improving cultural programs, as well as being open to new ideas and perspectives.
8. Accessibility and accommodation: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible and inclusive for all participants,
