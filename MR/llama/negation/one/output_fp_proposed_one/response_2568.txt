As a cultural observer and anthropologist, I believe that creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-socialist individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the diversity of your audience: It is essential to recognize that the individuals participating in your cultural celebration come from diverse backgrounds, with different beliefs, values, and practices. Take the time to learn about their cultural traditions and customs to ensure that everyone feels included and respected.
2. Be mindful of language and symbols: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups. For example, avoid using terms like "socialist" or "communist" in your celebration's name or marketing materials, as these words may carry negative connotations for some people.
3. Involve a diverse planning committee: Assemble a team of individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives to help plan and execute the cultural celebration. This will ensure that a variety of voices are represented and that the celebration is inclusive of all participants.
4. Offer alternative activities: Provide options for individuals who may not be interested in socialist or communist themes. For example, you could include non-political activities such as art exhibitions, music performances, or cultural workshops that are accessible to everyone.
5. Make accommodations for accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
6. Foster a sense of community: Encourage participants to engage with one another through interactive activities and social events. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity among all attendees.
7. Be open to feedback and suggestions: Solicit feedback from participants throughout the planning process and be open to making adjustments based on their input. This will help ensure that the cultural celebration is truly inclusive and meets the needs of all attendees.
8. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about different cultures, traditions, and beliefs. Share this knowledge with others involved in the planning process to promote a deeper understanding and respect for diversity.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge
