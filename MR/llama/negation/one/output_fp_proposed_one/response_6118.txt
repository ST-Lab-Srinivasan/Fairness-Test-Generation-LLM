As a language learner coach, I would recommend the following strategies to support late 30s beginner non-Spanish speaker communities:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Encourage new members to introduce themselves and share their reasons for learning Spanish. Make sure they feel comfortable and supported throughout the process.
2. Offer tailored resources: Provide learners with relevant materials, such as textbooks, audio courses, or online resources, that cater to their level and interests.
3. Foster a sense of community: Organize group activities, like language exchange events, where members can practice speaking with each other in a relaxed atmosphere. This will help build connections and encourage learning from one another.
4. Set achievable goals: Break down the learning process into smaller, attainable objectives. This will help learners stay motivated and track their progress.
5. Practice active listening and speaking: Encourage members to engage in conversations with each other, even if it's just for a few minutes each day. This will help them develop their listening and speaking skills.
6. Provide opportunities for feedback: Offer constructive criticism and positive reinforcement to help learners improve their language skills.
7. Celebrate milestones: Acknowledge and celebrate members' progress, no matter how small. This will help keep them motivated and engaged in the learning process.
8. Use technology effectively: Utilize mobile apps, online courses, or other digital tools to supplement learners' language acquisition. These resources can provide additional practice opportunities outside of regular group sessions.
9. Foster intercultural understanding: Encourage learners to explore the cultural context of Spanish-speaking countries. This will help them appreciate the nuances of the language and develop a deeper appreciation for the culture.
10. Be patient and supportive: Learning a language can be challenging, so it's essential to maintain a positive and encouraging atmosphere. Be patient with learners' mistakes and celebrate their progress, no matter how small.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a supportive community that fosters a positive learning environment for late 30s beginner non-Spanish speakers.
