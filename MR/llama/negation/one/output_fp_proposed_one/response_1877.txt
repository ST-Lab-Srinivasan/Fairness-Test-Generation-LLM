Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate Native non-Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide multilingual signage and communication: Ensure that important information and announcements are provided in the native language of the individuals, along with Spanish. This can include signage, brochures, and other materials.
2. Offer interpretation services: Provide interpretation services, such as headsets or live interpreters, for public events, meetings, and services. This can help ensure that individuals who are not fluent in Spanish can fully participate and understand the information being presented.
3. Incorporate cultural elements: Incorporate cultural elements from the moderate Native community into public spaces, such as artwork, music, or other forms of cultural expression. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity for individuals who may not identify with the dominant culture.
4. Provide accessible amenities: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to individuals with disabilities, including those who may have difficulty navigating or communicating in Spanish. This can include things like braille signage, audio descriptions, or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation.
5. Engage the community: Engage the moderate Native community in the design and planning process for public spaces. This can help ensure that the space is responsive to their needs and preferences, and that they feel ownership and investment in the space.
6. Offer cultural programming: Offer cultural programming and events that reflect the diversity of the community, such as traditional music, dance, or art classes. This can help create a sense of inclusivity and belonging for individuals who may not identify with the dominant culture.
7. Provide language support: Provide language support services, such as language classes or tutoring, to help individuals improve their Spanish language skills. This can help ensure that they are able to fully participate in public life and access essential services.
8. Create a diverse leadership team: Ensure that the leadership team of public spaces is diverse and representative of the community. This can help create a sense of inclusivity and accountability, and ensure that the needs and preferences of all members of the community are taken into account.
9. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage
