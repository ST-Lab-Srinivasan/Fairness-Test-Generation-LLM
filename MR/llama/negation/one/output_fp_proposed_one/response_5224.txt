Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and well-being of older, non-independent individuals aged 90 and above. Here are some ways mentorship can benefit this age group:

1. Social interaction: Older adults who live alone or have limited social interaction may feel isolated or lonely. A mentor can provide regular social interaction, which is essential for mental health and well-being.
