I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, but it is important to recognize that each person has their own unique identity that is influenced by a variety of factors, including their personal experiences, values, and beliefs.

It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's identity based on their race or ethnicity, and it is important to treat each person as an individual rather than making generalizations about them based on group membership. Additionally, it is important to respect people's right to hold different political beliefs and values, and to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with those who may hold different views.

In short, cultural heritage can play a role in shaping the identities of individuals, but it is important to approach each person as an individual and to avoid making assumptions or generalizations based on group membership.
