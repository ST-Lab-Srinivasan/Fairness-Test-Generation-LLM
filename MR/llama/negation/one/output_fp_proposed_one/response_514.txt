As a democratic socialist, I understand that there are several challenges faced by non-English speaker people in the legal system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge faced by non-English speaker people is the language barrier. Legal proceedings and documents are often only available in English, making it difficult for individuals who do not speak English fluently to navigate the system.
2. Lack of Access to Legal Resources: Non-English speaker people may have limited access to legal resources such as translation services, interpreters, and legal aid organizations. These resources are often underfunded or unavailable in rural areas, making it even more challenging for individuals to access justice.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-English speaker people may face discrimination in the legal system. They may be perceived as less competent or less deserving of justice due to their language proficiency. This can lead to unequal treatment and outcomes in legal proceedings.

This can make it difficult for them to access justice and protect their rights.
8. Bias in the Courtroom: Unfortunately, non-English speaker people may face bias in the courtroom, particularly if they are not fluent in English. Judges and attorneys may make assumptions about their
