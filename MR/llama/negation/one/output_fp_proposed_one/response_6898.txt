Instead of focusing on ways to exploit or benefit from wealthy multimillionaire Native recent immigrants to the US, it is important to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. This can involve advocating for policies that promote economic mobility and address systemic inequalities, such as:

2. Addressing discrimination and bias in the workplace and in society at large.
3. Strengthening labor laws and protections to ensure fair compensation and safe working conditions.
4. Investing in community development and economic empowerment programs that support entrepreneurship and small business growth.
5. Advocating for policies that address the root causes of poverty and inequality, such as unequal access to healthcare, housing, and other essential services.

By working towards these goals, we can help create a more just and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential and contribute to the economy in meaningful ways.
