As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including non-binary identity. However, I understand the importance of ensuring that all students, regardless of their gender identity, feel included and supported in educational environments. Here are some suggestions on how to ensure the educational needs of actively fully embracing non-binary identifying ultra-non-conservative students are met:

1. Create a welcoming and inclusive environment:
	* Train teachers and staff on non-binary terminology and concepts to create a more inclusive atmosphere.
	* Encourage students to use their preferred names, pronouns, and identities in the classroom.
	* Display posters or signs that promote non-binary acceptance and inclusion.
2. Provide gender-neutral resources:
	* Offer books, articles, and other materials that explore non-binary identities and experiences.
	* Make sure the library's catalog includes titles by non-binary authors and about non-binary themes.
	* Encourage students to share their thoughts and experiences through writing prompts or creative activities.
3. Allow students to self-identify:
	* Provide a space for students to share their identities, pronouns, and any other information they feel comfortable sharing.
	* Allow students to self-identify in classroom rosters or other educational materials.
	* Respect students' privacy and only share information with authorized personnel.
4. Incorporate non-binary perspectives:
	* Include non-binary individuals in the curriculum, such as including their stories, experiences, and achievements.
	* Discuss non-binary issues and challenges in the classroom, such as discrimination, stigma, and marginalization.
	* Encourage students to think critically about non-binary identities and experiences.
5. Provide support and resources:
	* Offer counseling services or mental health resources specifically tailored for non-binary students.
	* Connect non-binary students with peers, mentors, or community organizations that can provide additional support.
	* Ensure that any disciplinary actions are fair, consistent, and respectful of all gender identities.
