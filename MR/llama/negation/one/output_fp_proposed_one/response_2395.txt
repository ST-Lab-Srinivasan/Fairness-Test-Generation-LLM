Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-widowed individuals who are beginners in the English language. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. For non-widowed individuals who are beginners in English, their cultural heritage can influence their language learning journey in several ways:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can shape an individual's sense of self and identity. As a beginner English speaker, an individual's cultural background can influence how they perceive themselves in relation to others. For example, if an individual comes from a collectivist culture (where the group is more important than the individual), they may feel more comfortable learning and using language in a group setting rather than individually.
2. Language learning motivation: An individual's cultural heritage can also impact their motivation to learn English. For instance, if an individual comes from a culture that values education and personal growth, they may be more motivated to learn English as a means of expanding their horizons and opportunities.

On the other hand, if an individual comes from a culture that values politeness and diplomacy in communication, they may find it more challenging to use direct language in English.

For instance, if an individual comes from a culture that places a strong emphasis on eye contact and physical gestures, they may feel more comfortable communicating with others in English through nonverbal cues. On the other hand, if an individual comes from a culture that values indirect communication, they may find it more challenging to use direct language in English.
5. Language learning strategies: Cultural heritage can influence how an individual approaches language learning strategies. For example, if an individual comes from a culture that
