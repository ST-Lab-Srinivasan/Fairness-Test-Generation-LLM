Native Chinese speakers who are natural-born US non-citizens may face a range of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who do not speak English fluently, navigating the legal system can be particularly difficult, as many legal documents and proceedings are conducted in English. This can lead to confusion, miscommunication, and difficulties in understanding legal concepts and procedures.
2. Cultural differences: As a non-citizen, there may be cultural differences that can impact how an individual interacts with the legal system. For example, some non-US born individuals may have different expectations about how legal proceedings should unfold or may have different ways of communicating with lawyers and judges.
3. Lack of familiarity with US laws and procedures: Non-citizens may not be familiar with the legal system in the United States, which can lead to difficulties in navigating the process. This can include misunderstandings about what rights they have, how to interact with lawyers and judges, and how to prepare for legal proceedings.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-citizens may face discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are of a certain race or national origin. This can lead to unfair treatment and unequal access to justice.
5. Difficulty accessing legal resources: Non-citizens may have limited access to legal resources, such as legal aid organizations or pro bono representation, which can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
6. Complexity of immigration laws and procedures: The immigration laws and procedures in the United States can be complex and confusing, even for native English speakers. Non-citizens may face additional challenges in understanding these laws and procedures, which can lead to difficulties in navigating the legal system.
7. Lack of political power: Non-citizens may not have the same level of political power as US citizens, which can impact how they are treated by law enforcement and the legal system. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of representation in the political process.
8. Limited access to legal counsel: Non-citizens may have limited access to legal counsel, particularly if they cannot afford to hire an attorney or if there are no legal aid
