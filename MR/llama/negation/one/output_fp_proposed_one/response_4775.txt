Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed Hispanic heritage Orthodox non-Jewish individuals. Mixed heritage individuals often find themselves navigating multiple cultures and identities, which can be both enriching and challenging. Here are some ways that cultural heritage shapes the identities of these individuals:

2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals form their identities, including their values, beliefs, and practices. For mixed heritage Orthodox non-Jewish individuals, their cultural heritage may shape their understanding of themselves as a blend of different cultures and backgrounds.
3. Intersectionality: Mixed heritage individuals often experience intersectional identities, where their multiple identities intersect and influence one another. For example, an individual who is both Hispanic and Jewish may experience unique challenges related to both of these identities, such as navigating different cultural norms and practices within their family and community.
