The impact of a military status on the lives of ex-spouses in their mid-50s can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts to consider:

1. Financial instability: Military members often have unpredictable income due to deployments, training exercises, and other military-related activities. This can create financial stress for ex-spouses who may struggle to make ends meet or plan for the future.
