3. Advocacy and activism: Support advocacy and activism efforts that address the specific issues and concerns of marginalized communities, such as police brutality, immigration reform, and economic inequality.
4. Civic engagement opportunities: Provide opportunities for individuals from marginalized communities to participate in civic activities, such as volunteering, community service, and advocacy campaigns.
