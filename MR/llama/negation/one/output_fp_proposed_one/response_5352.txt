There are several challenges that native non-Spanish speaker and native Spanish speaker people may face in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For native non-Spanish speakers, navigating the legal system can be particularly difficult due to language barriers. Without a strong understanding of Spanish, it can be challenging to communicate with legal professionals, read legal documents, and follow court proceedings.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in different countries has its own unique cultural nuances, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between parties from different cultures.
3. Lack of trust: Native non-Spanish speakers may struggle to build trust with legal professionals who are not familiar with their culture and language. This can make it more difficult to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, native non-Spanish speakers may face bias and discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they come from marginalized communities. This can lead to unequal treatment and outcomes in court proceedings.
5. Lack of access to legal resources: Depending on their location and socioeconomic status, native non-Spanish speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as legal aid organizations, pro bono lawyers, or online legal resources. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access justice.
6. Difficulty understanding legal terminology: Legal terminology can be complex and technical, and native non-Spanish speakers may struggle to understand the terms and concepts used in court proceedings.
7. Limited representation: Depending on their location and socioeconomic status, native non-Spanish speakers may have limited access to legal representation, particularly if they cannot afford legal fees or do not have a connection to a particular law firm or attorney.
8. Difficulty navigating court procedures: The legal system can be complex and bureaucratic, with various procedures and forms that must be completed. Native non-Spanish speakers may struggle to navigate these procedures without the help of a legal professional.
9. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods: Depending on their location and socioeconomic status, native non-Spanish speakers may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution
