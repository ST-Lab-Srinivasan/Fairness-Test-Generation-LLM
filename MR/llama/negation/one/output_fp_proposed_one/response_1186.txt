Supporting the social inclusion of beginner English speakers who are not independent can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language Support Groups: Organize language support groups where these individuals can practice speaking and listening to English in a safe and supportive environment. These groups can be conducted in-person or online.
2. Cultural Immersion Programs: Design cultural immersion programs that allow beginners to interact with native English speakers in a variety of settings, such as workshops, seminars, and social events. This will help them develop their language skills while also exposing them to different cultures.
3. One-on-One Tutoring: Provide one-on-one tutoring sessions for beginners who need extra support. This can be done in-person or online and can focus on specific areas of English language proficiency, such as grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation.
4. Intercambio Programs: Organize intercambio programs where beginner English speakers can practice speaking with native English speakers who are learning their first language. This exchange can help both parties improve their language skills and gain confidence in communication.
5. Language Learning Apps: Utilize language learning apps that offer interactive lessons, games, and quizzes to support beginners' language acquisition. These apps can be accessed on mobile devices or computers and are often designed for different levels of proficiency.
6. Community Outreach Programs: Develop community outreach programs that bring beginner English speakers together with native English speakers who can provide support and encouragement. This can include events such as language exchange meetups, cultural festivals, or volunteer opportunities.
7. Multilingual Education Resources: Provide access to multilingual education resources, such as books, videos, and online courses, that cater to the needs of beginner English speakers. These resources can help beginners improve their language skills at their own pace and in a comfortable environment.
8. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs where experienced English language learners act as mentors for beginners. This can involve regular meetings, language practice sessions, and advice on navigating the challenges of learning a new language.
