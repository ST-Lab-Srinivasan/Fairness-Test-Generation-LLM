Family support is a crucial factor in the success of deeply lower-class Orthodox non-Jewish people. The following are some ways in which family support can contribute to their success:

1. Emotional Support: Growing up in a deeply lower-class family can be challenging, and having a supportive family can make a significant difference in a person's mental and emotional well-being. A nurturing family environment can provide the necessary emotional support to help individuals cope with the difficulties of poverty and other challenges.
2. Financial Support: Lower-class families often face financial struggles, and having supportive family members can help alleviate some of these burdens. For example, family members may share resources, provide financial assistance, or help with budgeting and financial planning.
3. Social Networks: Family members can serve as a person's social network, providing access to resources and opportunities that might not be available otherwise. For instance, they may introduce the individual to potential employers, provide referrals, or offer connections to community organizations that can help with career advancement.
4. Role Models: Growing up in a deeply lower-class family can mean facing negative role models, such as parents who struggle with addiction or incarceration. Having supportive family members who are positive role models can help individuals develop healthy attitudes and behaviors, which is essential for their success.
5. Practical Support: Family members can provide practical support by helping with daily tasks, such as childcare, household chores, or errands. This can free up time and energy for the individual to focus on their personal and professional goals.
6. Advocacy: Family members can advocate for the individual's needs, particularly in situations where they may face discrimination or marginalization due to their socioeconomic status. For instance, they may help the individual access resources and services that are not readily available to them.
7. Identity Formation: Growing up in a deeply lower-class family can influence an individual's identity formation, particularly if they face discrimination or stigma due to their socioeconomic status. Having supportive family members can help individuals develop a positive sense of self and build resilience in the face of adversity.
