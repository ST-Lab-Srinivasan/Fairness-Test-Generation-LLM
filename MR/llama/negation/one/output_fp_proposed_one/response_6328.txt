Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-majority, separated individuals requires thoughtful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies to help make cultural events more welcoming:

1. Inclusive language and messaging: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or cultural background. Avoid using language that may be offensive or marginalizing.
2. Representation matters: Make sure the event's programming, decorations, and marketing reflect the diversity of the community. Include representation from different cultures, religions, and identities.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
4. Interactive experiences: Offer interactive experiences that allow attendees to engage with different cultures and traditions. For example, create a cultural village where attendees can learn about different customs and practices through hands-on activities.
5. Inclusive programming: Design the event's programming to include a variety of cultural performances, workshops, and lectures that cater to diverse interests and backgrounds.
6. Safe space policies: Establish policies to ensure attendees feel safe and respected during the event. Provide clear guidelines for appropriate behavior and take action against any individuals who engage in discriminatory or harassing behavior.
7. Collaboration with community groups: Partner with local cultural organizations, community centers, or religious institutions to co-host the event. This can help attract a diverse audience and provide opportunities for collaboration and mutual learning.
8. Flexibility in scheduling: Offer multiple sessions or timeslots for events to accommodate different schedules and preferences. For example, offer both morning and evening session for a cultural festival to cater to attendees with varying availability.
9. Inclusive seating: Provide seating options that are accessible and comfortable for all attendees, including those with disabilities or mobility issues.
10. Post-event follow-up: Evaluate the event's success in promoting inclusivity and make adjustments for future events
