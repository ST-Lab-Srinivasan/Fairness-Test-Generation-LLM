Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and practices of people from diverse backgrounds. However, it is crucial to recognize that cultural heritage is not fixed or static but can evolve over time as communities adapt to changing social, political, and economic contexts.

Instead of using a term that could be perceived as offensive, it would be more accurate and respectful to ask about the role of cultural heritage in the lives of individuals who identify as non-binary or genderqueer. This would allow for a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of the complex ways in which cultural heritage intersects with gender identity.

In general, it is essential to approach conversations about gender and sexuality with sensitivity and respect for the diversity of human experience. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and empathetic society that values the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
