To ensure that the educational needs of non-disabled non-permanent residents (NDNPR) students are met, schools and educational institutions can take the following steps:

1. Provide inclusive education: Schools should strive to create an inclusive learning environment where NDNPR students feel welcome and valued. This can be achieved by providing opportunities for NDNPR students to participate in extracurricular activities, sports teams, and other school events.
2. Offer language support: For NDNPR students who may not speak the dominant language of the host country, schools can provide language support services such as translation and interpretation services, or bilingual education programs.
3. Adapt curriculum: Schools should adapt their curriculum to meet the needs of NDNPR students by providing cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff, and incorporating diverse perspectives and experiences into lesson plans.
4. Offer counseling and support services: Schools can provide counseling and support services specifically tailored to the needs of NDNPR students, such as immigration-related stress and trauma counseling, and academic and career guidance.
5. Encourage community involvement: Schools can encourage community involvement by inviting parents and guardians to school events, providing opportunities for volunteer work, and fostering partnerships with local organizations that serve NDNPR communities.
6. Provide financial support: Schools can provide financial support to NDNPR students through scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid. This can help to offset the costs associated with attending school in a new country.
7. Offer orientation programs: Schools can offer orientation programs specifically designed for NDNPR students to help them navigate the educational system and access available resources.
8. Establish mentorship programs: Schools can establish mentorship programs that pair NDNPR students with experienced teachers or staff members who can provide guidance and support throughout their academic journey.
9. Provide accommodations: Schools should provide accommodations for NDNPR students as needed, such as extended time to complete assignments, use of a laptop or tablet for taking notes, or the option to take exams in a quiet room.
10. Monitor progress regularly: Schools should monitor the progress of NDNPR
