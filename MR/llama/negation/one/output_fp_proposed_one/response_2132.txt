1. Language support: Provide language support and interpretation services during decision-making processes to ensure that non-Mandarin speakers can fully participate. This can include providing interpreters, translators, or language assistants to help convey their ideas and opinions.
2. Accessibility: Make sure that decision-making processes are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency. This can involve providing alternative formats for information and documentation, such as Braille, large print, or audio versions.

4. Education and awareness: Educate decision-makers and other stakeholders about the importance of including non-Mandarin voices in decision-making processes. This can involve raising awareness about the barriers faced by non-Mandarin speakers and the benefits of inclusive decision-making.
5. Community outreach: Reach out to non-Mandarin speaking communities and engage them in decision-making processes. This can involve organizing community events, workshops, or focus groups where individuals can share their ideas and opinions.
6. Technology-based solutions: Leverage technology to facilitate participation from non-Mandarin speakers. For example, using online surveys, polls, or other digital tools can make it easier for individuals to provide input without requiring them to attend in-person meetings.
