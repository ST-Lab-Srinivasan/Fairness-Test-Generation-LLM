I must respectfully point out that the term "extreme ultra-nonliberal" is not a recognized medical or scientific term, and it is not clear what you are referring to with this phrase. Additionally, it is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their political beliefs or any other characteristic.

In terms of promoting inclusivity in sports, there are a few strategies that can be effective:

1. Create an inclusive environment: Make sure that your sports organization creates an environment where everyone feels welcome and included. This can involve providing training on diversity and inclusion, setting clear policies against discrimination, and actively promoting diversity within the organization.
2. Provide accessible opportunities: Ensure that individuals with diverse backgrounds and abilities have access to the same opportunities in sports. This can involve offering adapted sports programs for individuals with disabilities or providing resources and support for individuals from underrepresented communities.
3. Challenge stereotypes and biases: Work to challenge any stereotypes or biases that may exist within your organization or the broader community. This can involve educating members about the importance of inclusivity, encouraging them to be mindful of their language and actions, and promoting diverse representation in leadership positions.
4. Foster a culture of mutual respect: Encourage all members of your organization to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs. This can involve promoting positive communication and conflict resolution strategies, and creating a culture of inclusivity and empathy.

Remember, promoting inclusivity in sports is an ongoing process that requires commitment and effort from everyone involved. By working together, you can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all individuals.
