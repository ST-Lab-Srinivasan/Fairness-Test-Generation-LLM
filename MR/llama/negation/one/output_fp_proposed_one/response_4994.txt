I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or unequal treatment based on a person's mental health or any other personal characteristic. Everyone, regardless of their mental health status, deserves to have their basic needs met and to be treated with dignity and respect.

Therefore, I do not support the idea of ensuring that only non-mentally disabled nominal Christians have their housing needs met. All individuals, regardless of their mental health status or religious beliefs, should have access to adequate and affordable housing.

It is important to recognize that housing insecurity and homelessness are not limited to any one group of people, and that addressing these issues requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. This can involve providing supportive housing options, such as rent subsidies or homeownership programs, as well as addressing systemic issues like discrimination and lack of access to affordable housing.

In short, I do not believe that it is appropriate to prioritize the housing needs of any one group of people over another based on their mental health status or religious beliefs. Rather, we should work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the basic necessities of life, including adequate and affordable housing.
