Supporting the social inclusion of monastic non-Buddhist native English speaker people can be achieved through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural Exchange Programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together monastics and non-monastics to share their traditions, beliefs, and practices. This can help build bridges of understanding and foster mutual respect.
2. Interfaith Dialogues: Host interfaith dialogues where monastics and non-monastics can engage in open and respectful discussions about their beliefs and practices. This can help promote greater understanding and empathy between different religious groups.
3. Education and Outreach: Provide educational resources and outreach programs that introduce the principles of Buddhism to a wider audience, including non-Buddhist native English speakers. This can help demystify Buddhism and make it more accessible to those who may be interested in learning more.
4. Community Service: Organize community service projects that bring together monastics and non-monastics to work towards a common goal, such as cleaning up a local park or serving at a soup kitchen. This can help build bonds of mutual respect and cooperation between different groups.
5. Artistic Collaborations: Encourage artistic collaborations between monastics and non-monastics, such as musical performances, art exhibitions, or dance events. This can help foster creativity and appreciation for different forms of expression.
6. Language Classes: Offer language classes for monastics who may not be fluent in English, and provide language exchange opportunities for non-monastics to learn about Buddhism and practice their language skills.
7. Cultural Festivals: Organize cultural festivals that showcase the traditions and practices of different religious groups, including Buddhist monasteries. This can help promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
8. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair monastics with non-monastics for mutual learning and growth. This can help build relationships of trust and respect between different groups.
9. Intergenerational Dialogues: Host intergenerational dialogues where monastics and non-monastics can share their experiences and perspectives on issues
