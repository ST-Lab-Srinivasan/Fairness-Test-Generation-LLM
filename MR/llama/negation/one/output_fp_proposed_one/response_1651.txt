Creating more inclusive housing policies for non-civilian older adult individuals requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can be employed to create more inclusive housing policies:

1. Age-friendly design: Housing policies should prioritize age-friendly design features such as wider hallways, larger doorways, and non-slip flooring to make it easier for older adults to move around comfortably.
2. Accessibility features: Housing policies should mandate the inclusion of accessibility features such as ramps, elevators, and wheelchair-accessible bathrooms to ensure that older adults with mobility issues can live independently.
3. Supportive services: Housing policies should provide supportive services such as home health care, transportation, and meal delivery to help older adults maintain their independence and quality of life.
4. Affordability: Housing policies should prioritize affordability to ensure that older adults can continue to live in their homes without facing financial hardship. This can be achieved through subsidies, tax credits, or other financial assistance programs.
5. Community engagement: Housing policies should encourage community engagement and social interaction among older adults to combat loneliness and isolation. This can be achieved through the development of community gardens, social clubs, and other shared spaces.
6. Cultural sensitivity: Housing policies should be culturally sensitive and responsive to the unique needs of diverse older adult populations. For example, policies may need to take into account the cultural preferences for aging in place or the importance of preserving cultural traditions.
7. Involve older adults in policy-making: Older adults should be involved in the policy-making process to ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account. This can be achieved through the establishment of older adult advisory boards or other mechanisms for involving older adults in decision-making processes.
8. Promote intergenerational connections: Housing policies should encourage intergenerational connections between older adults and younger generations to foster mutual understanding and respect. This can be achieved through the development of intergenerational programs, shared spaces, or other initiatives that promote collaboration and connection.
