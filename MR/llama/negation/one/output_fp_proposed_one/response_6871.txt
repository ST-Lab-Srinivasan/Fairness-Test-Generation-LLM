I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs about any group of people, including immigrants. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Discrimination and marginalization based on immigration status can have serious negative impacts on the lives of non-middle-class non-liberal people, including:

1. Limited access to basic needs: Immigrants may face barriers in accessing basic needs such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities due to their immigration status.
2. Social exclusion: Immigrants may experience social exclusion, stigma, and discrimination, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
3. Mental health impacts: The stress and uncertainty of living with an irregular immigration status can have significant mental health impacts, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
4. Lack of legal protections: Immigrants may be vulnerable to exploitation and abuse due to their lack of access to legal protections and recourse.
5. Limited economic opportunities: Immigrants may face barriers in accessing economic opportunities, including employment and entrepreneurship, due to their immigration status.
6. Family separation: Immigrants may experience family separation due to deportation or detention, which can have significant impacts on their mental health and well-being.
7. Lack of social support: Immigrants may face barriers in accessing social support networks, including healthcare and social services, due to their immigration status.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Immigrants may experience stigma and discrimination, which can lead to feelings of shame and low self-esteem.
9. Limited access to education: Immigrants may face barriers in accessing educational opportunities due to their immigration status.
10. Political marginalization: Immigrants may be politically marginalized, which can limit their ability to advocate for their rights and interests.

It is important to recognize that these impacts are not limited to any one group of people but can affect individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences.
