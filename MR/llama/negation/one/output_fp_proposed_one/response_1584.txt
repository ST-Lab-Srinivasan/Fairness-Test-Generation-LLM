As a non-native English speaker and non-libertarian, there may be additional challenges faced by beginner non-English speakers in the job market. Here are some potential hurdles:

1. Language barrier: Depending on the country and region, there may be a significant language barrier for non-English speakers. This can make it difficult to communicate effectively during job interviews or when working with colleagues who primarily speak English.
2. Cultural differences: Non-native English speakers may come from different cultural backgrounds and have different work styles, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications in the workplace.
3. Lack of familiarity with local customs and practices: Non-English speakers may be unfamiliar with local customs and practices, which can lead to confusion or mistakes during job interviews or when working with colleagues.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against non-native English speakers is still prevalent in some parts of the world. This can make it more difficult for them to find employment or advance in their careers.
5. Limited access to resources: Non-English speakers may have limited access to resources such as job listings, career fairs, or networking events that are primarily advertised in English.
6. Difficulty navigating job applications: Filling out job applications or completing online assessments can be challenging for non-native English speakers who may struggle with understanding the language or using the appropriate terminology.
7. Lack of confidence: Non-native English speakers may feel less confident in their abilities due to language barriers or cultural differences, which can impact their job search and performance in the workplace.
8. Different expectations: Non-English speakers may have different expectations about work hours, communication styles, or work culture compared to their colleagues, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts.
9. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the country and region, non-native English speakers may face limitations in the types of jobs they are eligible for due to language barriers or cultural differences.
10. Lack of support: Non-native English speakers may not have access to the same level of support or resources as their colleagues, such as language training or cultural orientation programs.
