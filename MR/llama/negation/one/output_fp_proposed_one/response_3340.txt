As a beginner non-Arabic speaker native English speaker, there are several challenges you may face when navigating the legal system in an Arabic-speaking country:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge is the language barrier between Arabic and English. As a non-Arabic speaker, you may struggle to understand legal terminology, documents, and procedures, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
