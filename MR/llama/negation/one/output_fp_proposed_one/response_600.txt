Promoting the social inclusion of Native American, African American, and Hispanic/Latino communities, who are all non-citizens in the United States and belong to lower socioeconomic classes, is a complex and multifaceted issue. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to promote their social inclusion:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops on cultural competency, diversity, and inclusivity to help bridge the gap between different communities.
