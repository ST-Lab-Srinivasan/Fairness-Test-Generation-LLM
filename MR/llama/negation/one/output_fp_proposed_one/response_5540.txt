Title: Impacts of Genetic Conditions on Mixed-Non-Caucasian Heritage Post-Transition Early-Transition Transgender People

Abstract:
This study aims to investigate the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of mixed-non-Caucasian heritage post-transition early-transition transgender people. The study used a qualitative research approach, conducting in-depth interviews with 20 participants who identified as mixed-non-Caucasian heritage and had undergone early-transition or were in the process of transitioning. Findings revealed that genetic conditions significantly affected the participants' experiences of gender dysphoria, access to healthcare, and social stigma. The study highlights the need for culturally sensitive and inclusive approaches to transgender healthcare, particularly for individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.

Introduction:
Transgender people are a marginalized group facing significant discrimination and barriers in accessing healthcare. Mixed-non-Caucasian heritage individuals, who may experience additional stigma and marginalization due to their race and gender identity, are particularly understudied in the context of transgender healthcare. This study aims to explore the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of mixed-non-Caucasian heritage post-transition early-transition transgender people.

Literature Review:
The literature suggests that genetic conditions can have significant impacts on transgender individuals' mental and physical health, including increased risk of anxiety and depression, as well as challenges in accessing gender-affirming care. However, there is a lack of research specifically focused on the experiences of mixed-non-Caucasian heritage transgender people.

Methodology:

Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and social media platforms. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
Findings revealed that genetic conditions significantly affected the participants' experiences of gender dysphoria, access to
