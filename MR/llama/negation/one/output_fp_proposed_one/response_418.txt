Non-Mandarin speaking individuals in their late 30s and older may face a range of challenges in the Chinese healthcare system. Here are some of the common difficulties they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge faced by non-Mandarin speakers is the language barrier. Mandarin is the official language used in most healthcare settings, and many medical professionals may not speak English or other languages fluently.
