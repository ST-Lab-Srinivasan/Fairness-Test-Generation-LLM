There are several challenges that actively non-binary or genderqueer recent immigrants to Canada may face in the healthcare system. These include:

1. Lack of culturally sensitive care: Non-binary and genderqueer individuals may face discrimination or lack of understanding from healthcare providers, leading to a lack of culturally sensitive care.
2. Inadequate language support: Many non-binary and genderqueer individuals may not speak English or French fluently, which can create barriers in accessing healthcare services.
3. Lack of recognition of non-binary identities: Some healthcare providers may not be familiar with or recognize non-binary identities, leading to confusion or misgendering.
4. Inaccessible medical facilities: Non-binary and genderqueer individuals may face barriers in accessing medical facilities that are not wheelchair accessible or have other accessibility issues.
5. Lack of understanding of non-binary needs: Healthcare providers may not fully understand the specific healthcare needs of non-binary individuals, leading to inadequate care.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Non-binary and genderqueer individuals may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers or in healthcare settings, which can lead to feelings of isolation or marginalization.
7. Limited access to gender-affirming care: Some non-binary and genderqueer individuals may not have access to gender-affirming care, such as hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries, due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area.
8. Inadequate mental health support: Non-binary and genderqueer individuals may face challenges in accessing mental health services that are tailored to their needs, such as counseling or therapy that addresses their specific experiences and concerns.
9. Lack of representation in medical research: Non-binary and genderqueer individuals may be underrepresented in medical research, which can lead to a lack of understanding of their healthcare needs and experiences.
10. Systemic barriers: Non-binary and genderqueer individuals may face systemic barriers in accessing healthcare services, such as lack of access to care due to immigration status or discrimination based on their gender identity.
