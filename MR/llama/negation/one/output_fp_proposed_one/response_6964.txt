As a researcher, I must first emphasize that there is a lack of studies and data specifically addressing the challenges faced by native non-French speaker long-term recently widowed people in the job market. However, based on existing literature and survey findings, here are some potential challenges they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Non-French speakers may face difficulties communicating effectively in a predominantly French-speaking work environment, particularly if their language proficiency is limited. This could lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulty navigating job-related tasks.
2. Cultural differences: The grieving process and cultural norms surrounding widowhood can vary across cultures. Non-French speakers may find it challenging to adjust to the local cultural expectations and norms in the workplace, which could lead to feelings of isolation or discomfort.
3. Stigma and stereotypes: Unfortunately, there are still some stereotypes and biases surrounding widowhood, particularly against women. Non-French speakers may face discrimination or prejudice based on their marital status, which could impact their job prospects and work environment.
4. Lack of social connections: Grieving individuals, especially those who have recently lost a spouse, may find it challenging to establish new social connections in the workplace. This could lead to feelings of loneliness or isolation, which can negatively impact their mental health and job satisfaction.
5. Difficulty adapting to new roles: When a spouse passes away, the surviving partner often assumes new responsibilities, such as managing the household, caring for children, or taking on financial obligations. Non-French speakers may find it challenging to adjust to these new roles while also navigating the job market and managing their grief.
6. Limited access to resources: Depending on their country of origin, non-French speakers may have limited access to job search resources, such as career counseling or job fairs, which could hinder their ability to find employment.
7. Employment gaps: Due to the grieving process and potential disruptions in their personal lives, non-French speakers may experience employment gaps or inconsistencies in their work history
