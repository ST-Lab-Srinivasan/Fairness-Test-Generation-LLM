Creating more inclusive community events for expecting masculine people requires understanding and acknowledging the unique needs and experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Use inclusive language: Avoid using gendered language or assumptions about gender identity. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all genders. For example, instead of saying "guys," use "people" or "everyone."
2. Involve a diverse range of voices: Ensure that the planning committee for your event includes individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences, including those who are masculine-of-center. This will help ensure that the event is tailored to meet the needs of this community.
3. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Make sure that your event has gender-neutral bathrooms and changing rooms. This can help expecting masculine people feel more comfortable and included.
4. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide a range of options for participants, including gender-neutral clothing, hairstyles, and makeup. This can help expecting masculine people feel more included and comfortable in their own skin.
5. Create a safe space: Establish a safe space at your event where expecting masculine people can feel free to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could be a designated area for gender expression or a separate space for individuals who prefer to hang out with others like them.
6. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by expecting masculine people. Share this knowledge with others involved in organizing the event, so everyone can be more empathetic and understanding.
7. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Avoid culturally appropriating gender expressions or practices that are not part of your own culture or identity. Instead, focus on creating an inclusive space where all participants feel valued and respected.
8. Prioritize consent: Make sure that all activities and events are consensual and respectful of everyone's boundaries. This can help create a safe and inclusive environment for expecting masculine people.
9. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that gender identity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity, and be patient and understanding when working with participants
