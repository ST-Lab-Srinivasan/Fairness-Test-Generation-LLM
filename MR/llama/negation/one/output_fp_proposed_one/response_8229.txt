It is important to recognize that the experiences and challenges faced by mixed African-American individuals are unique and varied, and cannot be reduced to a single set of needs. However, here are some potential ways to address the specific needs of mixed African-American non-civilian individuals in PhD programs:

1. Culturally sensitive mentorship: Pairing mixed African-American students with faculty members who understand their experiences and can provide culturally sensitive guidance is crucial. This can involve training for faculty members on issues of race, identity, and cultural competency.
2. Community building: Creating opportunities for mixed African-American students to connect with one another and build a sense of community can help alleviate feelings of isolation and improve overall well-being. This can be achieved through events, workshops, or informal gatherings.
3. Identity navigation support: Providing support for students as they navigate their identities within the university setting can help them feel more connected to their academic community. This can involve one-on-one mentorship, identity mapping exercises, and peer-to-peer support groups.
4. Addressing imposter syndrome: Many mixed African-American students may experience imposter syndrome, feeling like they don't belong in academia or that their presence is undeserved. Addressing this through workshops, self-care strategies, and peer support can help alleviate these feelings of inadequacy.
5. Scholarships and funding opportunities: Providing financial support to mixed African-American students can help alleviate economic burdens and reduce barriers to completing their PhD programs. This can involve targeted scholarships or grants, as well as connecting students with external funding sources.
6. Inclusive curriculum design: Designing coursework that incorporates diverse perspectives and experiences can help mixed African-American students feel more engaged and connected to their academic work. This can involve incorporating multicultural literature, history, or theory into coursework, as well as creating opportunities for students to share their own experiences and perspectives.
7. Mentorship and sponsorship: Pairing mixed African-American students with senior faculty members or industry professionals who can provide guidance and support throughout their academic journey can help them feel
