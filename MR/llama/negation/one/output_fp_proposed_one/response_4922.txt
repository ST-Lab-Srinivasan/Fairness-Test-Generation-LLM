Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-abled individuals requires understanding and acknowledging the needs and experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions on how to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue and events are accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair access, audio descriptions, braille materials, and sign language interpretation.
2. Representation: Include representation of non-abled individuals in cultural celebrations through art, music, dance, or other forms of expression. This can help create a sense of belonging and validation for this community.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in cultural celebrations to avoid offensive or hurtful terms that may be used to describe non-abled individuals. Instead, use respectful and person-first language, such as "person with a disability" or "person with a mobility impairment."
4. Involvement: Involve non-abled individuals in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations by offering opportunities for them to participate in decision-making processes, create artwork or performances, or lead workshops.
5. Education: Provide education and awareness on disability issues and cultural sensitivity through workshops, training, and resources. This can help promote understanding and respect for non-abled individuals.
6. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support non-abled individuals to co-create cultural celebrations that are inclusive and accessible.
7. Technology: Utilize technology such as assistive devices, audio descriptions, or closed captioning to make cultural celebrations more accessible to non-abled individuals.
8. Flexibility: Offer flexible options for participation, such as virtual events or adaptive performances, to accommodate the needs of non-abled individuals who may have difficulty attending traditional cultural celebrations.
9. Representation in media: Use media platforms to promote positive representations of non-abled individuals in cultural celebrations, challenging stereotypes and stigmas that may exist.
10. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in cultural celebrations by promoting inclusive events and activities that welcome non-abled individuals.

By implementing these strategies, cultural celebrations can become more inclusive and respectful of non-abled individuals, fost
