Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identity Among Recently Divorced Multiple Times Non-Spanish Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly among those who have experienced multiple divorces. This study aims to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of recently divorced multiple times non-Spanish speaker individuals. By exploring the ways in which cultural heritage influences identity formation, this research can provide insights into the complex interplay between cultural background and personal identity.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity. For example, studies have found that cultural values and beliefs can shape an individual's worldview, self-concept, and social relationships (Hong & Kim, 2014). Moreover, cultural heritage can influence an individual's sense of belonging and connection to their community (Warf, 2006). However, the impact of cultural heritage on identity formation may be particularly pronounced among recently divorced individuals who have experienced multiple marriages and divorces.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, utilizing in-depth interviews with recently divorced multiple times non-Spanish speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. The interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
