As a beginner non-French speaker, navigating the French legal system can present several challenges. Here are some of the common difficulties that you may face:

1. Language barrier: The legal language used in France is primarily French, which can make it difficult for non-French speakers to understand and navigate the system. Even if you know some French, the legal terminology and concepts can be complex and challenging to grasp.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in France is deeply rooted in French culture and history, which means that there are certain expectations and norms that may not be familiar to non-French speakers. For example, the concept of "savoir vivre" (the art of living) is highly valued in French society, and this can impact how legal proceedings are conducted and resolved.
3. Lack of knowledge about the system: As a beginner, you may not be familiar with the French legal system or its procedures. This can make it difficult to navigate and understand the different steps involved in the process, such as filing a complaint, appearing in court, or negotiating a settlement.
