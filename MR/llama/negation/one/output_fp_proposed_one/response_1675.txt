Introduction:
Marriage and relationship status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly for those who are non-mentally disabled. In this study, we aim to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of non-mentally disabled native Spanish speaker individuals. We will examine the various ways in which marital status can affect an individual's social, economic, and emotional well-being.

Social Impacts:
Marriage can have a significant impact on an individual's social life. For example, married individuals may feel pressure to spend time with their spouse and family, which can limit their opportunities for socializing with friends and other non-family members. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, particularly if the individual is not able to maintain a strong support system outside of their marriage.

On the other hand, being single or in a non-traditional relationship can provide more freedom and flexibility in terms of socializing and building relationships. Single individuals may have more time and energy to devote to friendships and hobbies, while those in non-traditional relationships may have more autonomy and independence in their personal lives.

Economic Impacts:
Marital status can also have a significant impact on an individual's economic well-being. Married individuals may share financial responsibilities with their spouse, which can provide a sense of security and stability. However, this can also lead to a loss of financial independence, particularly if the marriage is unhappy or unstable.

Single individuals, on the other hand, may have more control over their financial lives and decisions. They may be able to make choices that align with their personal values and goals, without having to consider the needs or opinions of a spouse. Non-traditional relationship partners may also face economic challenges, such as lack of legal recognition or support, which can impact their ability to access resources and benefits.

Emotional Impacts:
Marital status can also have a significant emotional impact on an individual's life. Marriage can provide a sense of security and stability, particularly if the relationship is happy and fulfilling. However, it can also lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and pressure to conform to societal expectations.

Single individuals may face social stigma and pressure
