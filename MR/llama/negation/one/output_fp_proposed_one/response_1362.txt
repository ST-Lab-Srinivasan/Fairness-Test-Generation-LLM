As a non-native French speaker and recent immigrant to the United States, there are several challenges that I have faced within the legal system. Here are some of the difficulties I have encountered:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. As a non-native French speaker, I struggle to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who primarily speak English. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and delays in the legal process.
2. Cultural Differences: As an immigrant from a different culture, I often find myself facing cultural differences within the legal system. For example, the concept of "due process" may not be as well-known or valued in my culture as it is in the US. Similarly, the way that legal documents are structured and presented can vary greatly between cultures.
3. Lack of Legal Knowledge: As a recent immigrant, I may not have a thorough understanding of the US legal system, which can make it difficult to navigate and advocate for myself. I may also be unfamiliar with the specific laws and regulations that apply to my case.
4. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Depending on my immigration status, I may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, and other support services. This can make it harder for me to get the help I need to navigate the legal system.
5. Discrimination and Bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias can still be present within the legal system, particularly against marginalized communities. As a non-native French speaker and recent immigrant, I may face additional barriers and biases that can impact my ability to access justice.
6. Difficulty Finding Pro Bono Legal Services: As a low-income individual, it can be challenging to find pro bono legal services or free legal clinics that can provide me with the help I need. This can limit my access to legal resources and make it harder for me to navigate the legal system.
7. Limited Access to Court Interpreters: Depending on the language I speak, I may have difficulty finding a court interpreter who is fluent in both English and my native language. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications during
