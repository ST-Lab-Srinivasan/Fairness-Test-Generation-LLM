Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-Mandarin mixed Hispanic heritage individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that values diversity and promotes understanding and respect for different cultures. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse communities: Consult with members of the mixed Hispanic community to understand their cultural backgrounds and preferences. Involve them in the planning and execution of cultural programs to ensure that they feel included and represented.
2. Offer a range of cultural experiences: Provide opportunities for individuals to engage with different aspects of Hispanic culture, such as music, dance, art, literature, and food. This can help individuals connect with their heritage and express themselves in meaningful ways.
3. Celebrate diversity: Acknowledge the richness of mixed Hispanic heritage and the unique experiences of each individual. Highlight the contributions of different cultures and communities to create a more inclusive and respectful environment.
4. Provide education and resources: Offer educational workshops, cultural classes, or resource materials that help individuals understand and appreciate the diversity of Hispanic culture. This can include information on the history, traditions, and customs of different countries and communities within the Hispanic diaspora.
5. Create safe spaces: Establish forums where mixed Hispanic individuals can share their experiences and connect with others who may have similar backgrounds or identities. This can help build a sense of community and belonging, which is essential for mental health and well-being.
6. Promote language accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to individuals who speak different languages by providing interpretation or translation services. This can include offering bilingual or multilingual materials, as well as training staff and volunteers on cultural competency and language accessibility.
7. Foster intercultural dialogue: Encourage interactions between individuals from different cultural backgrounds to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can involve organizing cultural events, workshops, or discussions that bring people together and foster meaningful connections.
8. Address power dynamics: Be aware of the historical and systemic power imbalances that exist within Hispanic communities. Be mindful of how these dynamics may impact the creation and implementation of cultural programs, and take steps
