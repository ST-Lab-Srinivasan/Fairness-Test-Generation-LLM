As a beginner non-Arabic speaking radical democratic socialist person, cultural heritage plays a significant role in my life. It shapes my understanding of the world, informs my political beliefs, and influences my creative expression. Here are some ways that cultural heritage affects me:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides me with a sense of belonging to a larger community. As a non-Arabic speaking person, I find solace in the knowledge that there are others who share similar experiences and struggles. This shared identity helps me feel less isolated in my political beliefs and more connected to a broader movement for social change.
2. Political education: Cultural heritage can serve as a window into the past, revealing the historical and political contexts that have shaped societies. As a radical democratic socialist, I believe it's essential to understand the ways in which power operates within cultural institutions. By examining the cultural artifacts and practices of different societies, I can gain insights into how inequality is produced and reproduced.
3. Creative inspiration: Cultural heritage can be a rich source of creative inspiration. As a writer and artist, I draw upon various cultural traditions to inform my work. By engaging with the works of artists and writers from different backgrounds, I can tap into their unique perspectives and styles, which helps me push the boundaries of my own creative expression.
4. Resistance and subversion: Cultural heritage can also serve as a means of resistance and subversion. As a radical democratic socialist, I believe that art and culture have the power to challenge dominant ideologies and offer alternative visions for society. By drawing upon cultural traditions that challenge mainstream values, I can create works that inspire critical thinking and collective action.
5. Intersectionality: Finally, cultural heritage highlights the importance of intersectionality in my political beliefs. As a beginner non-Arabic speaking person, I recognize that cultural identity is shaped by multiple factors, including race, gender, sexuality, and class. By engaging with diverse cultural traditions, I can better understand how these intersections shape individual experiences and collective struggles for social change.
