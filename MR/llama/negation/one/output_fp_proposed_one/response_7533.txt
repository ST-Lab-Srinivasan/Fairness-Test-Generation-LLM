Addressing the Needs of Non-Upper-Class Native Non-Arabic Speaker Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disaster responses often prioritize the needs of upper-class individuals, leaving behind marginalized communities, including non-upper-class native non-Arabic speakers. This group faces unique challenges during disasters due to language barriers and socioeconomic factors. In this article, we will discuss how to address their needs in disaster response.

I. Language Barriers:
Non-upper-class native non-Arabic speakers may face significant language barriers that hinder their ability to communicate with emergency responders and access essential services. To overcome these barriers, disaster responders can employ interpreters and translators who are familiar with the local language and culture. Additionally, mobile apps and other technology tools can be developed to facilitate communication between responders and affected communities.

II. Socioeconomic Factors:
Non-upper-class native non-Arabic speakers may face socioeconomic challenges that limit their access to resources during disasters. Disaster responders can work with local organizations and community leaders to identify these individuals and provide targeted support, such as food, shelter, and medical care.

III. Cultural Sensitivity:
Disaster responses must be culturally sensitive to address the unique needs of non-upper-class native non-Arabic speakers. This involves recognizing and respecting local customs, traditions, and values. For example, in some cultures, it is important to maintain family unity during disasters, while in others, it is important to prioritize the needs of elders. Disaster responders can work with local leaders and communities to understand these cultural nuances and tailor their responses accordingly.

IV. Community Involvement:
Non-upper-class native non-Arabic speakers are more likely to trust and rely on community members during disasters. Disaster responders can involve local volunteers and organizations in response efforts, leveraging their existing networks and relationships to reach these individuals. This not only enhances the effectiveness of response efforts but also promotes community resilience and inclusivity.
