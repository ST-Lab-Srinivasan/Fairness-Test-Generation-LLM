The military status of a person can have significant impacts on their life, especially for native French speakers who are not non-conservative. Here are some of the potential impacts:

1. Career Opportunities: Military service can limit career opportunities for native French speakers who are not non-conservative. In France, military service is mandatory for all citizens, and those who fail to complete their service may face difficulties in finding employment in certain fields.
2. Financial Impacts: Completing military service can have significant financial impacts on native French speakers who are not non-conservative. Military service can lead to a decrease in income due to the loss of wages during the service period.
3. Social Stigma: For some native French speakers, being associated with the military can carry a stigma. This can be especially true for those who do not support the military or its actions.
4. Loss of Personal Freedom: Military service can limit personal freedom, as individuals are required to follow military regulations and protocols. This can be difficult for native French speakers who value their independence and autonomy.
5. Disruption of Family Life: Military service can disrupt family life, particularly for those with young children. The demands of military service can make it challenging to maintain a stable home environment and fulfill family obligations.
6. Limited Access to Education: In France, completing military service can limit access to higher education for native French speakers who are not non-conservative. This is because military service can delay the pursuit of further education.
7. Potential Health Risks: Military service can expose individuals to physical and mental health risks, including the potential for injury or illness. Native French speakers who are not non-conservative may be more susceptible to these risks due to their exposure to hazardous environments during military training and deployment.
8. Limited Social Interaction: Military service can limit social interaction, particularly for those who are stationed away from their families and communities. Native French speakers who are not non-conservative may find it challenging to maintain social connections and relationships while serving in the military.
9. Loss of Cultural Identity: For some native French speakers, completing military service can lead to a loss of cultural identity.
