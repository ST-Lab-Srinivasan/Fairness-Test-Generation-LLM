As a leadership development coach, here are some ways to support the leadership development of recently retired non-veterans who have been married for less than 10 years:

1. Reflective Practice: Encourage them to reflect on their previous work experiences and identify what skills they want to develop further or learn anew in retirement. Help them set goals that align with their interests, values, and aspirations.
2. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses: Assist them in recognizing their strengths and weaknesses as a leader. This self-awareness will enable them to focus on areas that need improvement and develop strategies for growth.
3. Build Self-Esteem: Help them cultivate a positive mindset by building their self-esteem and confidence. This can be done through various exercises such as journaling, meditation, or even creative pursuits like painting or writing.
4. Networking Opportunities: Arrange networking opportunities with other retired professionals, including those who have also recently retired. Encourage them to share their experiences and learn from one another's perspectives.
5. Mentorship: Pair them with a mentor who has extensive experience in leadership or a related field. This will provide them with valuable guidance, support, and accountability as they continue to develop their leadership skills.
6. Training Programs: Enroll them in training programs or workshops that focus on leadership development. These programs can cover various topics such as communication, problem-solving, decision-making, and team building.
7. Coaching: Offer one-on-one coaching sessions to help them identify and overcome any obstacles they may face in their personal or professional life. This will allow them to stay focused and motivated towards their leadership development goals.
8. Community Involvement: Encourage them to get involved in local community projects or initiatives that align with their interests and passions. This will provide them with opportunities to practice their leadership skills and make a positive impact on society.
9. Personal Development: Support their personal development by encouraging them to engage in activities that foster emotional intelligence, resilience, and adaptability. Examples include mindfulness practices, stress management techniques, or even learning a new language.
