Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US as non-civilian individuals in college requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account their unique experiences, cultural background, and academic challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive support services: Provide culturally responsive support services such as counseling, academic advising, and tutoring tailored to the needs of Native American students. These services should be delivered by trained professionals who understand the cultural nuances and challenges faced by this population.
2. Access to financial aid: Ensure that Native American students have access to financial aid and scholarships specifically designed for them. This can include federal and state-based programs, as well as private scholarships offered by organizations that support Native American education.
3. Cultural programming: Incorporate cultural programming into campus life, such as traditional dance and music performances, language classes, and cultural events. These initiatives can help foster a sense of belonging and connection to their heritage among Native American students.
4. Recognition of tribal status: Ensure that the college recognizes and respects the unique status of Native American students as members of their respective tribes. This can involve working with tribal leaders and organizations to develop policies and practices that support the academic success of these students.
5. Collaboration with tribal communities: Develop partnerships with local tribal communities to provide academic and cultural programming specifically tailored to the needs of Native American students. This can include internship and job shadowing opportunities, as well as collaborative research projects.
6. Inclusive hiring practices: Ensure that the college employs faculty and staff who are culturally competent in working with Native American students. This can involve training on cultural humility, inclusive hiring practices, and a commitment to diversity and inclusion.
7. Campus advocacy: Establish a campus-wide advocacy program that raises awareness about the unique challenges faced by Native American students. This can involve workshops, training sessions, and other initiatives designed to promote cultural understanding and inclusivity.
8. Community outreach: Develop relationships with local Native American communities to provide academic and cultural programming for high school students. This can help identify and recruit talented Native American students
