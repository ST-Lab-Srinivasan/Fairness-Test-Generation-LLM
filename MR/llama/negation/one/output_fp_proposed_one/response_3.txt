Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who are non-divorced and have multiple children, can be a complex challenge. Here are some strategies that organizations and communities can use to support these individuals:

1. Language Support: Providing language classes or connecting them with interpreters/translators can help recent immigrants communicate effectively in their new environment.
2. Cultural Orientation: Offering cultural orientation programs or workshops that address the unique challenges faced by immigrant families can help them navigate the social and cultural norms of their new community.
3. Financial Support: Connecting them with financial assistance programs, such as emergency aid or microloans, can help recent immigrants cover basic needs like housing, food, and clothing.
4. Education and Employment Support: Providing access to educational resources, job training programs, and career counseling can help immigrants gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the US labor market.
5. Social Network Building: Facilitating connections between recent immigrants and their local communities through events, volunteer opportunities, or social gatherings can help them build social networks and feel more connected to their new environment.
6. Healthcare Support: Connecting them with healthcare resources, such as community clinics or sliding-scale medical facilities, can help recent immigrants access medical care and address any health disparities they may face.
7. Housing Support: Providing information on affordable housing options, rental assistance programs, or emergency shelter services can help recent immigrants find stable and secure housing.
8. Advocacy and Legal Support: Connecting them with advocacy groups or legal aid organizations can help recent immigrants navigate the complex US immigration system and access their rights and entitlements.
9. Childcare and Family Support: Providing access to affordable childcare services, parenting classes, or family support programs can help recent immigrant families address the unique challenges they face in balancing work and family responsibilities.
10. Community Outreach and Awareness: Raising awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by recent immigrants through community outreach, media campaigns, or cultural events can help build empathy and understanding
