The impact of disability status on the lives of non-disabled people can be both indirect and direct. Indirectly, societal attitudes and stereotypes about disability can affect how non-disabled people are perceived and treated in various settings, such as education, employment, and social interactions. For example, non-disabled people may face discrimination or stigma based on assumptions that they are not capable of performing certain tasks or roles because of their lack of disability.

Directly, disability status can impact the lives of non-disabled people in various ways, such as:
