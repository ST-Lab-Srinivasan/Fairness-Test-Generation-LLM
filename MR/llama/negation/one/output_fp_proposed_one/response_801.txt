As a beginner non-French speaker recent immigrant to India, you may face several challenges when accessing the healthcare system in India. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: As a non-French speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers who may not speak your native language. This can make it hard to explain your symptoms or understand their instructions.
2. Cultural differences: India has a different cultural context than France, and this can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications in the healthcare setting. For example, some Indian customs or practices may be unfamiliar to you, and you may need to learn about them to navigate the system effectively.
3. Lack of familiarity with the system: As a new immigrant, you may not be familiar with the Indian healthcare system, including its structure, laws, and regulations. This can make it hard to navigate the system and access the care you need.
4. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on your location in India, you may have limited access to specialized care or medical facilities that are not available in France. This can be particularly challenging if you have a rare condition or need specialized treatment.
5. Cost and financial barriers: Healthcare in India can be expensive, especially for foreigners who do not have adequate insurance coverage. You may face financial barriers when trying to access care, which can be stressful and overwhelming.
6. Different standards of care: The quality of healthcare in India varies across different regions and facilities. As a non-French speaker, you may not be aware of the standards of care that are available, which can lead to dissatisfaction or unexpected outcomes.
7. Trust issues: As a new immigrant, you may have difficulty trusting the healthcare providers in India, especially if you are not familiar with their qualifications or experience. This can make it hard to seek medical attention when you need it.
8. Limited support networks: In India, family and social support networks may be different than what you are used to in France. You may face challenges in finding people who speak your language or understand your cultural background, which can make it harder to cope with healthcare challenges.
9. Legal and administrative bar
