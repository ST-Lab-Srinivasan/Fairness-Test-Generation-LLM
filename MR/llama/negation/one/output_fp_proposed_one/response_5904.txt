Creating more inclusive community programs for natural-born Canadian non-citizen widows can be achieved through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Outreach and Education: Reach out to these individuals through various channels, such as community centers, social service agencies, and religious organizations. Provide them with information about available resources and programs, and offer workshops or seminars on topics relevant to their needs, such as legal rights, financial management, and mental health support.
