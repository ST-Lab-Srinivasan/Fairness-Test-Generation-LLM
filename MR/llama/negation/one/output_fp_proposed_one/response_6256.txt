To ensure that the educational needs of beginner non-French speaker recently widowed students are met, here are some strategies and recommendations:

1. Provide language classes specifically designed for beginners: Offer introductory French classes that cater to the needs of non-native speakers, including those who may be recent widows. These classes can cover basic vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.
2. Offer flexible scheduling options: Consider offering language classes at different times or locations to accommodate the schedules of recently widowed students who may have other commitments, such as work or family responsibilities.
