Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those from ethnic minority backgrounds, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and representation. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Create safe spaces: Establish platforms where beginners can feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could be through online communities, language exchange programs, or in-person events.
2. Foster mentorship: Pair beginners with more experienced speakers from similar backgrounds to provide guidance, support, and role models. This can help build confidence and encourage participation in decision-making processes.
3. Provide training and resources: Offer workshops, webinars, or online courses on topics such as language learning, cultural competency, and decision-making skills. These resources can empower beginners to contribute meaningfully in these processes.
4. Amplify marginalized voices: Use your platform to highlight the experiences and perspectives of ethnic minority groups, particularly those who may be underrepresented or overlooked. This can be done through storytelling, advocacy, or simply sharing their voices in decision-making processes.

7. Build alliances: Collaborate with organizations that support ethnic minority communities to amplify their voices in decision-making processes. These alliances can help leverage resources, expertise, and influence to ensure marginalized voices are heard.
8. Develop inclusive language policies: Create policies that promote inclusivity in language learning and usage. For example, consider developing glossaries or dictionaries that reflect the diverse linguistic and cultural heritage of beginner Arabic speakers.
9. Provide feedback mechanisms: Establish mechanisms for beginners
