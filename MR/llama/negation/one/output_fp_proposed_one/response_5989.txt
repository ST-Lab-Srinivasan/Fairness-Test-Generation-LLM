Addressing the specific needs of strictly party non-asexual recent immigrants to India in education requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique experiences, challenges, and cultural backgrounds. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural sensitivity training for educators: Provide training sessions for teachers and administrators on cultural sensitivity and how to create an inclusive learning environment for immigrant students. This can help them understand the diverse needs of their students and provide appropriate support.
2. Language support: Offer language support services such as English language proficiency testing, language classes, or bilingual education programs to help immigrant students improve their language skills. This can help them navigate the educational system more effectively.
3. Adaptive curriculum: Develop adaptive curricula that cater to the diverse needs of immigrant students. This can include modifying the content, pace, and method of instruction to meet the individual needs of each student.
4. Support groups: Create support groups for immigrant students where they can connect with peers who share similar experiences. This can provide a sense of belonging and help them navigate the challenges of adapting to a new culture and education system.
5. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair immigrant students with experienced educators or peers who can provide guidance and support throughout their academic journey.
6. Sensitivity to religious practices: Be sensitive to the religious practices and beliefs of immigrant students, and provide accommodations where necessary. This can help them feel more comfortable and included in the educational environment.
7. Addressing trauma: Recognize that many immigrant students may have experienced trauma related to their migration journey or experiences in their home country. Provide mental health support services and create a safe space for them to share their experiences and receive support.
8. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to connect with immigrant communities and provide information about educational opportunities and resources available to them.
9. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with community organizations that cater specifically to the needs of immigrant populations, such as language schools or cultural centers. These organizations can provide valuable support and resources for immigrant students.
