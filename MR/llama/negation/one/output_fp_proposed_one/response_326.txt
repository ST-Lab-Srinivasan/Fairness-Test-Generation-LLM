Non-independent ethnically full Hispanic people in the United States face several challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges can affect their access to quality healthcare and their overall health outcomes. Some of the specific challenges faced by this population include:

1. Language barriers: Many non-independent ethnically full Hispanic people may not speak English fluently, which can create communication barriers when seeking medical care. This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, and can make it more difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system.
2. Cultural barriers: Hispanic/Latino culture places a strong emphasis on family and community, which can affect how individuals seek and receive medical care. For example, some may be hesitant to seek medical care unless a family member or trusted healthcare provider recommends it.
3. Limited access to healthcare providers: Non-independent ethnically full Hispanic people may face barriers in accessing healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about their cultural beliefs and practices. This can lead to delays in receiving appropriate medical care, or receiving care that is not tailored to their individual needs.
4. Limited access to specialized care: Non-independent ethnically full Hispanic people may face barriers in accessing specialized care, such as cancer treatment or mental health services. This can be due to a lack of availability of these services in their area, or because they cannot afford them.
5. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against Hispanic/Latino individuals still exist within the healthcare system. This can lead to lower quality care, and can make it more difficult for non-independent ethnically full Hispanic people to access the care they need.
6. Lack of representation in research: Historically, there has been a lack of representation of Hispanic/Latino individuals in medical research studies. This can lead to a lack of understanding of the unique healthcare needs and experiences of this population, which can affect the development of treatments and interventions.
7. Limited access to preventive care: Non-independent ethnically full Hispanic people may face barriers in accessing preventive care, such as routine check-ups or screenings for chronic diseases.
