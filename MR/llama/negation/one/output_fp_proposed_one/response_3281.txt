4. Encourage entrepreneurship: For individuals with non-genetic conditions who have a business idea or passion, providing resources and support for starting a business can help them achieve financial stability. This could include access to small business loans, mentorship opportunities, and training on how to navigate the entrepreneurial landscape.
5. Create support groups: Connecting individuals with non-genetic conditions to support groups can provide emotional support and practical advice on managing their condition while also promoting financial stability. These groups could be online or in-person and could include individuals who have successfully navigated similar challenges.
6. Advocate for policy change: Advocating for policies that promote financial stability for individuals with non-genetic conditions can help create a more inclusive society. This could involve advocating for access to affordable healthcare, job accommodations, and disability benefits.
