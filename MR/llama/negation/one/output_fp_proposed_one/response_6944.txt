Title: Impacts of Immigration Status on the Lives of Recently Pregnant, Non-Married People in the First Trimester

Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on various aspects of an individual's life, particularly during pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the experiences and challenges faced by recently pregnant, non-married people who are undocumented or have temporary or permanent residence in the United States. We will explore how immigration status affects their lives in the first trimester of pregnancy, including access to healthcare, emotional wellbeing, and financial stability.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that immigrants face numerous barriers when accessing healthcare services, including language barriers, lack of cultural competency among healthcare providers, and fear of deportation (1-3). These challenges are particularly pronounced for undocumented immigrants, who may avoid seeking medical care due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities (4). Additionally, research has shown that stress related to immigration status can have a profound impact on an individual's emotional wellbeing and mental health (5-7).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with recently pregnant, non-married people who are undocumented or have temporary or permanent residence in the United States. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers serving immigrant populations. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted in a language that is comfortable for the participants, and interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
Our findings indicate that immigration status has a significant impact on the lives of recently pregnant, non-married people. Undocumented immigrants reported difficulty accessing prenatal care due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities or lack of knowledge about their rights (8). Temporary and permanent residents faced similar challenges, but also struggled with the financial burden of medical expenses and the uncertainty of their immigration status during pregnancy (9-11). Emotional wellbeing was also affected, as participants reported feelings of anxiety, depression, and isolation related
