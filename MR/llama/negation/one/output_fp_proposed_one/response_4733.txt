Instead of focusing on specific cultural contributions of a particular group, it's important to recognize and celebrate the richness and complexity of African diasporic cultures as a whole.

1. Learn about their culture: Research and learn about the history, traditions, and customs of mixed African-non-American non-socialist communities. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, and engaging in conversations with members of these communities.
2. Appreciate their contributions: Acknowledge and appreciate the contributions that mixed African-non-American non-socialist people have made to society, such as their artistic, literary, musical, or culinary achievements.
