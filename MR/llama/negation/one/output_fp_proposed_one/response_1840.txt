Creating more inclusive community events for non-civilian working-class people requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify the needs of the community: Start by understanding the needs, interests, and challenges faced by the non-civilian working-class population in your area. Conduct surveys, focus groups, or interviews to gather insights and create a comprehensive picture of their needs.
2. Involve the community in planning and decision-making: Encourage members of the non-civilian working-class community to participate in the planning and decision-making process for community events. This can be done by creating a diverse planning committee or through other participatory techniques such as workshops, focus groups, or online surveys.
3. Choose accessible venues: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for people with disabilities or mobility issues. This could include selecting venues with wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible parking.
4. Provide affordable food options: Offer a variety of food options at the event, including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free choices, to cater to different dietary needs and preferences. Consider offering free or low-cost meals for those who cannot afford them.
5. Promote the event through multiple channels: Utilize a range of promotion channels to reach a broader audience, including social media, flyers, posters, and word of mouth. Ensure that the promotional materials are accessible and easy to understand for people with different levels of literacy or language proficiency.
6. Offer childcare and transportation options: Provide childcare services during the event, such as a play area or babysitting services, to enable parents to participate without worrying about their children's care. Also, consider offering transportation options for those who may not have access to reliable transportation.

8. Provide cultural activities and entertainment:
