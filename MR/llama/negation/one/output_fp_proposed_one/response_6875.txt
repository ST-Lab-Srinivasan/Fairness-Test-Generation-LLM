The term "non-lower-class non-nonliberal" is quite vague and could encompass a wide range of individuals, each with their own unique experiences and challenges. However, I can provide some general insights on how immigration status can impact the lives of individuals who are not part of a lower class or liberal group.

1. Discrimination: Non-lower-class non-nonliberal individuals may face discrimination based on their immigration status, particularly in employment, education, and housing. They may be denied opportunities or treated unfairly due to their perceived immigration status.
2. Uncertainty and Insecurity: Living with an uncertain immigration status can create a sense of insecurity and anxiety, as individuals may worry about their future prospects, including their ability to stay in the country they call home.
3. Limited Access to Services: Non-lower-class non-nonliberal individuals may face barriers when accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and legal aid. This can be due to language barriers, lack of documentation, or discrimination.
4. Social Isolationation: Individuals with uncertain immigration status may experience social isolation, as they may feel marginalized or excluded from social events, communities, and networks.
5. Economic Challenges: Non-lower-class non-nonliberal individuals may face economic challenges due to their immigration status. They may struggle to find employment or access financial resources, leading to poverty and economic insecurity.
6. Lack of Representation: These individuals may lack representation and support from mainstream organizations, which can exacerbate the challenges they face.
7. Stigma and Shame: The stigma associated with being an immigrant can lead to feelings of shame and embarrassment, affecting an individual's mental health and well-being.
8. Lack of Access to Healthcare: Non-lower-class non-nonliberal individuals may face barriers when accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status, leading to delayed or inadequate medical care.
9. Limited Political Power: These individuals may have limited political power and influence, as they may not be eligible to vote or participate in the political process.
