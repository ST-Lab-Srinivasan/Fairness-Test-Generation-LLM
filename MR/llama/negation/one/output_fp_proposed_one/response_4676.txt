As a non-high-income professional immigrant to the US, you may face several challenges when accessing and navigating the US healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barriers: If you do not speak English fluently or at all, it can be difficult to communicate with healthcare providers, understand medical instructions, and navigate the healthcare system.
2. Cultural differences: Immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can affect their healthcare experiences. For example, some cultures may have different attitudes towards Western medicine or may have traditional healing practices that are not recognized in the US.
3. Limited knowledge of the healthcare system: New immigrants may be unfamiliar with the US healthcare system, including how to access care, what services are covered under their insurance, and how to navigate the billing and payment process.
4. Cost and affordability: Many immigrants may face financial challenges when trying to access healthcare due to high out-of-pocket costs, deductibles, co-pays, and other expenses. This can be especially challenging for those who are not eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs.
5. Lack of insurance: Many immigrants may not have access to affordable health insurance, particularly if they are undocumented or have temporary or part-time work status. This can make it difficult for them to access necessary medical care.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Immigrants may face barriers when trying to access specialized care, such as language barriers or limited knowledge of the healthcare system. This can be particularly challenging for those who need complex or specialized medical care.
7. Discrimination and stigma: Immigrants may experience discrimination or stigma when seeking healthcare, particularly if they are undocumented or have a different cultural background. This can affect their willingness to seek medical care or report health concerns.
8. Difficulty navigating the complex healthcare system: The US healthcare system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Immigrants may find it difficult to navigate the system, including finding a provider, understanding their rights and responsibilities, and accessing necessary care
