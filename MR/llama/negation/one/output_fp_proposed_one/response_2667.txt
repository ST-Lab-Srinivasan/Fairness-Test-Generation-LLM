Creating more inclusive social policies for Nigerian secular non-Jewish individuals requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach. Here are some steps that can be taken:

1. Understand the diverse needs and experiences of different communities: It is essential to recognize that the Nigerian population is made up of various ethnic and religious groups, each with their unique cultural practices, beliefs, and values. To create inclusive policies, it is important to listen to and understand the specific challenges faced by these communities.
2. Promote interfaith dialogue and mutual understanding: Encouraging interfaith dialogue and promoting mutual understanding between different religious groups can help to build bridges of empathy and respect. This can be achieved through educational programs, community events, and other initiatives that bring people together.
3. Address social and economic inequalities: Many Nigerian communities face significant social and economic challenges, including poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and limited job opportunities. Policies that address these inequalities can help to promote greater inclusivity and social cohesion.
4. Advocate for the rights of marginalized groups: Marginalized groups such as women, children, and LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination and exclusion from mainstream society. Advocating for their rights and promoting their inclusion can help to create a more equitable and just society.
5. Promote civic education and political participation: Encouraging civic education and political participation can help to ensure that all citizens have a voice in the policy-making process and can hold their leaders accountable. This can be achieved through initiatives such as voter registration drives, community organizing, and advocacy campaigns.
6. Support community-based initiatives: Community-based initiatives such as volunteer programs, community gardens, and cultural festivals can help to foster a sense of community and promote inclusivity. These initiatives can also provide opportunities for citizens to come together and work towards common goals.
7. Address cultural and religious intolerance: Discrimination and violence against certain religious or cultural groups can be a significant barrier to inclusivity. Addressing these issues through education, advocacy, and community outreach can help to promote greater understanding and respect.
