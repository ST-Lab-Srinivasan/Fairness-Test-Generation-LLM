Ensuring that the voices of non-mentally disabled recent immigrants to Canada are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Reach out to non-mentally disabled recent immigrant communities through culturally sensitive outreach efforts. This can be done through community events, door-to-door canvassing, or partnering with local organizations that serve these communities. Engage them in discussions about their experiences and concerns, and ensure that their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
2. Language Accessibility: Provide language interpretation and translation services during consultations and decision-making processes to ensure that non-mentally disabled recent immigrants can fully participate. This can include providing bilingual staff, interpreters, or translators to facilitate communication.
3. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and stakeholders involved in the decision-making process. This can help increase awareness and understanding of the cultural practices, values, and beliefs of non-mentally disabled recent immigrant communities.
4. Inclusive Participation Mechanisms: Develop inclusive participation mechanisms that allow non-mentally disabled recent immigrants to participate fully in decision-making processes. This can include providing accessible formats for input, such as surveys or focus groups, and ensuring that these mechanisms are widely promoted within the communities being consulted.
5. Collaboration with Advocacy Groups: Partner with advocacy groups that represent non-mentally disabled recent immigrant communities to amplify their voices in decision-making processes. These groups can provide valuable insights and expertise in promoting inclusivity and equity in policy-making.
6. Public Education Campaigns: Launch public education campaigns to raise awareness about the experiences and concerns of non-mentally disabled recent immigrants. This can help shift attitudes and behaviors towards greater inclusivity and empathy, and promote greater understanding of the issues faced by these communities.
7. Accountability Mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms to ensure that decision-makers are held responsible for promoting inclusivity and equity in policy-making
