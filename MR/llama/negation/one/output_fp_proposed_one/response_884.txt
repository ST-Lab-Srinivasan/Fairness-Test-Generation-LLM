Creating more inclusive cultural events for agnostic and non-conservative individuals involves understanding and addressing the unique needs and preferences of these groups. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and respect individual beliefs and values: Make sure that the event is welcoming to people of all belief systems, including those who identify as agnostic or non-religious. Avoid promoting any one religion or ideology over others, and be sensitive to the feelings of those who may not align with these beliefs.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the event includes a variety of voices and viewpoints, representing different cultures, ethnicities, and backgrounds. This can be done by including a diverse lineup of performers, speakers, or artists, as well as incorporating different art forms and mediums.
3. Avoid religious or cultural appropriation: Be mindful of the cultural and religious practices of the communities you are inviting to the event. Avoid using elements of these cultures without proper understanding, respect, and permission. Instead, focus on creating a space where everyone can feel comfortable and included.
4. Provide accommodations for different needs: Consider the accessibility needs of attendees, including those with disabilities, older adults, or individuals who may need language support. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, or bilingual materials.
5. Encourage participation and engagement: Create opportunities for attendees to participate and engage with the event, such as through interactive performances, workshops, or discussions. This can help build a sense of community and inclusivity among attendees.
6. Foster a respectful and open-minded atmosphere: Encourage attendees to be open-minded and respectful of one another's beliefs and practices. Promote a culture of mutual understanding and empathy, where everyone can feel valued and included.
7. Offer educational opportunities: Provide educational opportunities throughout the event, such as workshops or lectures, that highlight different cultures, histories, and perspectives. This can help attendees gain a deeper understanding of the communities they are engaging with.
8. Encourage collaboration
