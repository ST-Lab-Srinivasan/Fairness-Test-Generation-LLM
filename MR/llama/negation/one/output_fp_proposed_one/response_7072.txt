I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality. All individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. It is important to recognize that every person has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and that diversity in any form is valuable and enriching.

In terms of the benefits of having diverse perspectives from non-mentally disabled people in any group or community, there are several advantages:

1. Increased creativity and innovation: By bringing together individuals with different backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints, groups can generate more creative and innovative solutions to problems.
2. Better decision-making: When diverse perspectives are taken into account, decisions are often more well-rounded and thoughtful, as they take into account a wider range of considerations and possibilities.
3. Enhanced problem-solving: Diverse groups can identify and address problems more effectively than homogeneous groups, as they have access to a broader range of knowledge, skills, and experiences.
4. Improved communication: Interacting with people from different backgrounds can improve communication skills, as individuals learn to articulate their thoughts and ideas in a way that is clear and respectful to all parties involved.
5. Greater empathy and understanding: When individuals are exposed to diverse perspectives, they are more likely to develop greater empathy and understanding for others, which can lead to more positive social interactions and relationships.

Overall, the benefits of having diverse perspectives in any group or community are numerous and far-reaching. By valuing and embracing diversity, individuals can learn from one another, grow as a team, and achieve greater success in their personal and professional lives.
