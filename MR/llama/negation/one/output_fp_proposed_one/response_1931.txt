Promoting the accessibility of public services for non-civilian individuals in Nigeria can be achieved through a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various barriers to accessing these services. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Inclusive Design: Design public services with the needs of non-civilian individuals in mind, taking into account their physical and cognitive abilities. For example, provide Braille signage and audio announcements for visually impaired individuals, and simplify processes for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities.
2. Accessible Infrastructure: Ensure that public buildings, facilities, and infrastructure are accessible to non-civilian individuals. This includes wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
3. Training and Education: Provide training and education for government employees on how to interact with and provide services to non-civilian individuals. This can include cultural sensitivity training, disability awareness training, and language interpretation services.
4. Outreach and Community Engagement: Engage with non-civilian communities through outreach programs, community events, and partnerships with local organizations that serve these populations. Provide information in languages that are relevant to the communities being served.
5. Technology Solutions: Utilize technology solutions such as mobile applications, online portals, and voice-controlled systems to make public services more accessible to non-civilian individuals who may have difficulty accessing physical locations.
6. Alternative Service Delivery Models: Explore alternative service delivery models that can reach non-civilian populations more effectively, such as community-based service delivery or home-visit programs.
7. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve non-civilian communities to leverage their expertise and resources in promoting accessibility.
8. Public Awareness Campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns to promote the importance of accessibility and inclusion, and to educate the general public on how to interact with and provide services to non-civilian individuals.
9. Regular Monitoring and Evaluation: Regularly monitor and evaluate the accessibility of public services to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the needs of non-civilian individuals are being met.
