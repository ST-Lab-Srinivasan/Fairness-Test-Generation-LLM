Ensuring the educational needs of binary not upper middle-income students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some possible ways to address this issue:

1. Scholarships and Financial Aid: Providing financial aid in the form of scholarships, grants, or loans can help binary not upper middle-income students pay for their education. This can include government-funded programs, institutional scholarships, and private scholarships.
2. Need-based aid: Institutions can offer need-based aid to students who demonstrate financial need. This can include federal student aid, such as the Pell Grant, as well as institutional aid.
3. Income share agreements: Income share agreements (ISAs) are a relatively new type of financial aid that allow students to receive funding in exchange for agreeing to pay back a percentage of their income after graduation. ISAs can be particularly helpful for binary not upper middle-income students who may struggle to afford the full cost of tuition.
4. Targeted outreach and recruitment: Institutions can target their recruitment efforts towards binary not upper middle-income students, through outreach programs and partnerships with organizations that serve these populations.
5. Flexible learning options: Offering flexible learning options such as online or part-time programs can help binary not upper middle-income students who may have work or family obligations that make it difficult to attend classes on a full-time basis.
6. Priority admissions: Institutions can prioritize the admission of binary not upper middle-income students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. This can help ensure that these students have access to educational opportunities that they may not have otherwise had.
7. Culturally responsive teaching: Teachers and educators can incorporate culturally responsive teaching practices into their classes, which can help binary not upper middle-income students feel more connected and supported in their academic journey.
8. Mentorship programs: Institutions can establish mentorship programs that pair binary not upper middle-income students with successful professionals from underrepresented groups. This can provide valuable guidance and support for these students as they navigate their academic and professional paths.
