Creating inclusive cultural programs for fully non-asexual recently single individuals requires understanding and accommodating their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that all single people are asexual or that they don't enjoy socializing. Recognize that singlehood can come in many forms, and some may be seeking social connections just like anyone else.
2. Use inclusive language: When promoting cultural programs, use language that is inclusive of all genders and orientations. Avoid using language that implies sexuality or relationships, such as "date night" or "couples only."
3. Focus on community building: Instead of organizing events around romantic partners, focus on creating opportunities for people to connect with each other based on shared interests or identity. This can include events specifically for singles, such as game nights, book clubs, or volunteer opportunities.
4. Offer alternative activities: Provide options for cultural programs that don't involve romantic partners, such as art classes, language exchange meetups, or outdoor adventures.
5. Be mindful of gendered spaces: Be aware of the gender dynamics in cultural programs and make sure they are inclusive of all genders. For example, avoid hosting events in spaces that are traditionally associated with masculinity or femininity.
6. Prioritize consent: Make sure that all participants have given their full and informed consent to participate in any cultural program. This can involve asking for participants' preferences regarding physical touch, gendered language, or other aspects of the event.
7. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt your programming based on feedback from single individuals. For example, if someone expresses discomfort with a particular activity, consider modifying it to make it more inclusive.
8. Highlight diverse representation: Include representations of diverse genders and orientations in any cultural programs or marketing materials. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusion for all participants.
9. Offer support: Provide resources or support for single individuals who may be facing unique challenges, such as social isolation or discrimination.
10. Listen and learn: Engage in ongoing dialogue with single individuals to understand their experiences and preferences. Use this feedback to continually improve and expand your cultural programs
