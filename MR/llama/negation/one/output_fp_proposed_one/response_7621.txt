Native Chinese speakers who are natural-born US non-citizens may face a number of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who do not speak English fluently, navigating the legal system can be particularly difficult. They may struggle to understand legal documents, communicate with lawyers and judges, and participate in court proceedings.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the US is based on common law, which may differ significantly from the legal systems in other countries, including China.
