As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the question you have asked is not appropriate or respectful. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to access quality healthcare regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality. Discriminating or making assumptions based on someone's age, race, or nationality is not acceptable and can lead to harmful consequences.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to improve the healthcare system for all individuals, regardless of their background. This can involve advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as increasing funding for healthcare services in underserved communities or promoting culturally sensitive care practices.

Remember, everyone deserves access to quality healthcare, and it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable system for all.
