As a mixed Asian heritage person who is not fluent in Arabic, I can attest to the challenges that come with navigating the legal system in the Middle East and North Africa. Here are some of the challenges that I have faced:

1. Language barrier: As a non-Arabic speaker, I face significant difficulties when trying to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals. Many legal documents and proceedings are conducted in Arabic, making it hard for me to understand and participate in the legal process.
2. Lack of cultural understanding: As a mixed Asian heritage person, I have a unique cultural background that can sometimes make it difficult for me to navigate the legal system in the Middle East and North Africa. For example, some cultural practices or beliefs may not align with the legal system, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin is still prevalent in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa. As a non-Arabic speaker, I may face additional barriers or biases in the legal system, which can impact my ability to access justice.
4. Limited access to legal resources: In some countries, there may be limited access to legal resources for non-Arabic speakers, such as interpreters, translators, or legal aid services. This can make it difficult for me to access legal advice or representation, particularly in emergency situations.
5. Difficulty navigating Islamic law: In some countries, the legal system is based on Islamic law (Shariah). As a non-Arabic speaker, I may find it challenging to navigate these legal frameworks, which can be complex and nuanced.
6. Limited representation: As a mixed Asian heritage person, I may face challenges finding legal representatives who understand my cultural background and can advocate for my rights within the legal system.
7. Stigma and discrimination against mixed-race individuals: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma and discrimination against mixed-race individuals in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa. As a non-Arabic speaker, I may face additional barriers or biases in the legal system due to my racial or ethnic background.
