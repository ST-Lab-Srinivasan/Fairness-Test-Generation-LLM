Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-middle-class income individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the celebration is accessible to people of all income levels by offering affordable tickets or free admission. This can be achieved through partnerships with local organizations, sponsorships, or crowdfunding campaigns.
2. Diverse Lineup: Program a diverse lineup of performers, artists, and speakers that reflect the community's diversity. This can include local acts, emerging artists, and established names from underrepresented groups.
3. Inclusive Venue: Choose a venue that is wheelchair accessible, has gender-neutral restrooms, and offers accommodations for people with disabilities. This helps ensure that everyone can participate and feel included.
4. Community Engagement: Involve the local community in the planning process by hosting town halls, surveys, or focus groups. This will help identify cultural celebrations that are meaningful to the community and ensure their participation.
5. Interactive Elements: Incorporate interactive elements into the celebration, such as workshops, hands-on activities, and interactive installations. This encourages audience participation and creates a more immersive experience.
6. Representation Matters: Make sure the cultural celebration represents the community's diverse backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This can be achieved by incorporating traditional music, dance, art, and food from different ethnic groups.
7. Collaborations: Collaborate with local organizations, schools, and community groups to co-create the cultural celebration. This helps build partnerships and ensures that the event is inclusive and representative of the community.
8. Education and Outreach: Offer educational programs, workshops, or outreach initiatives leading up to the cultural celebration. These can include lectures, panel discussions, or hands-on activities that promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
9. Inclusive Marketing: Develop marketing materials that are inclusive and respectful of diverse identities. Avoid language or imagery that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group.
