Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled mixed Asian heritage individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach that takes into account the unique experiences and challenges faced by this community. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive public policies:

1. Consult with mixed Asian heritage communities: Conduct research and engage in consultations with mixed Asian heritage communities to better understand their experiences and identify the specific barriers they face. This will help policymakers develop policies that are tailored to their needs.
2. Challenge stereotypes and assumptions: Disability and race-based stereotypes can perpetuate discrimination against mixed Asian heritage individuals. Policymakers must challenge these stereotypes and assumptions by recognizing the diversity of experiences within the mixed Asian heritage community.
3. Focus on individualized support: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may face unique challenges that are not addressed by one-size-fits-all policies. Policymakers should focus on providing individualized support and accommodations to ensure equal access to opportunities and resources.
4. Address intersectionality: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may experience intersecting forms of discrimination based on their race, disability status, and other aspects of their identity. Policymakers must consider the intersections of these identities when developing policies to ensure that they are inclusive of all individuals.
5. Advocate for representation: Ensure that mixed Asian heritage individuals are represented in decision-making processes and have a voice in shaping public policies. This can be achieved through targeted recruitment initiatives or by providing opportunities for participation in policy-making forums.
6. Develop cultural competency training: Provide cultural competency training for policymakers and service providers to better understand the experiences and needs of mixed Asian heritage individuals. This can help reduce cultural barriers and improve the delivery of services.
7. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with community organizations and advocacy groups representing mixed Asian heritage communities to develop policies that are responsive to their needs. These partnerships can help identify gaps in service provision and ensure that policies are grounded in community perspectives.
8. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent mixed Asian heritage individuals from accessing opportunities and resources. For
