Addressing the needs of non-Mandarin speakers in disaster response requires a multi-faceted approach that considers their language barriers and other unique challenges. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Provide multilingual support: Ensure that communication materials, such as flyers, posters, and announcements, are available in multiple languages, including the non-Mandarin languages spoken by the affected population. Use visual aids and simple language to make them accessible to everyone.
