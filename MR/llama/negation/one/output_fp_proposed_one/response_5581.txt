Creating more inclusive community events for non-genetic, non-widowed individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming:

1. Use language that is inclusive: Avoid using language that implies exclusivity, such as "widows" or "widowers." Instead, use language that is more inclusive, such as "people who have experienced loss."
2. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities, such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
3. Promote diversity: Make sure your event promotes diversity in all aspects, including the advertising, speakers, and attendees. Use images and messaging that reflect the diversity of your community.
4. Involve diverse voices: Ensure that the perspectives of diverse individuals are represented on your planning committee or as speakers. This can help create a more inclusive event that reflects the needs and experiences of all attendees.
5. Create a safe space: Establish a safe space for attendees to share their experiences and connect with others who may be going through similar challenges. This can be done by providing a designated area for attendees to share their stories or by incorporating safe space protocols into your event.
6. Offer childcare: Provide childcare services or make arrangements for children to be cared for during the event, so that parents can focus on participating in the event without worrying about their children's needs.
7. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that your event is accessible to all attendees, including those with mobility issues or other disabilities. This may involve providing wheelchair accessibility, Braille materials, or audio descriptions.
8. Provide translators: Offer translation services for individuals who may not speak the dominant language of the event. This can help ensure that everyone has equal access to information and can participate fully in the event.
9. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt your plans based on feedback from attendees or as needs arise during the event. Being flexible and responsive to the needs of attendees can help create a more inclusive environment.
10. Follow best practices for accessibility:
