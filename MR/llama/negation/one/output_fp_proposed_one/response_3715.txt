Supporting child non-Arabic speaker communities in Arabic-speaking countries can be challenging, but there are several effective strategies that have been shown to improve their language acquisition and academic performance. Here are some of these strategies:

1. Immersion programs: Immersion programs involve surrounding children with the target language from an early age. This can be done through various means such as enrolling them in Arabic-language schools, hiring Arabic-speaking teachers, and using Arabic-language media and materials in the classroom. Research has shown that immersion programs are effective in promoting language acquisition and academic achievement among non-native speakers (Kraus et al., 2017).
2. Bilingual education: Bilingual education involves teaching academic content in two languages, one of which is the target language. This approach has been shown to be effective in promoting language acquisition and academic achievement among non-native speakers (Lim & Plass, 2016).
3. Language support classes: Providing language support classes for non-Arabic speaker children can help them catch up with their peers in terms of language proficiency. These classes can be offered before or after regular school hours and can include activities such as language games, songs, and stories (Al-Sowayan et al., 2017).
4. Parental involvement: Encouraging parents to be involved in their child's language learning process can have a positive impact on their language acquisition. This can be done through various means such as attending parent-teacher conferences, volunteering in the classroom, and practicing language skills with their children at home (Gardner & Lambert, 1972).
5. Use of technology: Utilizing technology such as language learning apps, videos, and games can be an effective way to support child non-Arabic speaker communities in learning the Arabic language. Research has shown that technology-based language learning can be as effective as traditional classroom instruction (Kiraly et al., 2014).
6. Focusing on communication rather than grammar: Children learn best when they are communicating and interacting with their environment, so focusing on communication rather than grammar can help them acquire the language more effectively
