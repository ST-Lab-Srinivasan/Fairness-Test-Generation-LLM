Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Time Married Beginner Non-French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have been married for many years and are beginner non-French speakers. This study aims to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of this demographic group. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews, we will explore how cultural heritage influences their sense of self, values, beliefs, and practices.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity in various ways. For instance, research has shown that cultural heritage can influence an individual's worldview, moral beliefs, and social behaviors (Hall, 1976). Additionally, cultural heritage can affect an individual's sense of belonging and attachment to a particular group or community (Gordon, 1995).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach using interviews with long-time married beginner non-French speakers. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, and the sample size will be purposefully limited to ensure depth of analysis. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted in a language that is comfortable for the participants, either English or French. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis. This method involves identifying and coding themes within the data, and then organizing these codes into broader categories (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The themes that emerge from the data will be related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of the participants.

Expected Findings:
Based on previous research and theoretical frameworks, we expect that cultural heritage will play a significant role in shaping the identities of long-time married beginner non-French speakers. Specifically, we anticipate that the participants' cultural heritage will influence their values, beliefs, and practices related to marriage, family, and community.

Conclusion:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding
