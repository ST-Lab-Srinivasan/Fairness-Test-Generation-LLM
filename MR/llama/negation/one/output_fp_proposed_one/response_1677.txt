Introduction:
Marriage and partnership are significant life events that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. In China, the traditional definition of marriage is based on the Confucian concept of "xiao" ( Filial piety), which emphasizes the importance of family obligations and social hierarchy. However, with the changing social norms and increasing awareness of mental health, the impact of marital status on the lives of non-mentally disabled beginner Chinese speakers is an area that requires attention. This study aims to investigate the effects of marital status on the daily lives of non-mentally disabled beginner Chinese speakers in China.

Literature Review:
The literature on the impact of marital status on mental health has shown mixed results. Some studies have found that married individuals experience better mental health outcomes compared to their unmarried counterparts (Koenen et al., 2015), while others have found no significant differences in mental health outcomes between married and unmarried individuals (Haines & Neale, 2006).

In the context of China, there is limited research on the impact of marital status on non-mentally disabled beginner Chinese speakers. However, studies have shown that marriage can have a positive impact on social integration and mental health in this population (Zhang et al., 2015). Additionally, research has found that the cultural expectations and societal pressures associated with marriage in China can have both positive and negative effects on the daily lives of non-mentally disabled beginner Chinese speakers (Chen & Xu, 2016).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods design, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. A total of 300 non-mentally disabled beginner Chinese speakers in China will be recruited for the study through convenience sampling. Participants will complete a survey assessing their marital status, social integration, and mental health outcomes. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences and perceptions of non-mentally disabled beginner Chinese speakers in relation to marital status.

Results:
The results of the study are expected to provide valuable insights into the impact of marital status on the daily lives of non-ment
