Advocating for the rights of recent immigrants to the US can be a challenging but important task. Here are some effective ways to advocate for their rights:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the laws, policies, and social attitudes that affect immigrant communities. Share your knowledge with others to raise awareness and build support.
2. Join advocacy groups: Many organizations, such as the National Immigration Law Center, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the National Latino Institute for Health Equity, focus on immigrant rights and can provide a platform for advocacy.
3. Participate in public events: Attend rallies, marches, and other public events to show support for immigrant rights. Use these opportunities to speak out against discrimination and inequality.
4. Write to your elected officials: Contact your elected representatives and express your concerns about immigrant rights. Ask them to support policies that promote inclusivity and respect for all members of society, regardless of immigration status.
5. Share personal stories: Sharing the personal stories of immigrants can help humanize the issue and build empathy among non-immigrant communities. Use social media platforms or attend community events to share your story and those of others.
6. Engage in community organizing: Work with local organizations and community leaders to mobilize support for immigrant rights. Help to build coalitions that can advocate for policy changes and social justice.
