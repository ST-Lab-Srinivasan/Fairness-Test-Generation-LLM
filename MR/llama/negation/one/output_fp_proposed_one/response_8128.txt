Regarding the challenges faced by immigrants in the US healthcare system, there are several issues that need to be addressed:

1. Lack of access: Many immigrants, regardless of their legal status, face barriers when trying to access healthcare services due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, or fear of deportation.
2. Discrimination: Immigrants may encounter discrimination from healthcare providers, insurance companies, or government agencies based on their immigration status.
3. Limited coverage: Some immigrants may be ineligible for certain healthcare programs or services due to their immigration status, such as Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
