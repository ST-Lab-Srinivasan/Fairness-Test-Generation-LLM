Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular non-Jewish recent immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that cultural institutions, organizations, and communities can adopt:

1. Inclusive programming: Design cultural programs that cater to a diverse audience, including non-Jewish immigrant groups. Offer events, exhibitions, and performances that reflect the rich cultural heritage of these communities, such as traditional music, dance, art, and food.
2. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve non-Jewish immigrant populations, such as ethnic community centers, to reach a broader audience. Work together to develop culturally sensitive programs that resonate with these communities.
3. Bilingualism and multilingualism: Offer programs in the languages spoken by the immigrant communities, such as Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic. Provide translation services for events, exhibitions, and performances to ensure accessibility.
4. Education and outreach: Develop educational materials and outreach strategies that explain the cultural significance of Jewish culture and its relevance to non-Jewish immigrants. Engage with local schools and community groups to promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
5. Accessibility and inclusivity: Ensure that all cultural programs are accessible and inclusive for everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
6. Intersectionality and social justice: Acknowledge the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and other forms of identity within immigrant communities. Develop programs that address these intersections and promote social justice and inclusivity.
7. Community engagement and participation: Encourage active participation from non-Jewish immigrant communities in the development and implementation of cultural programs. Involve them in decision-making processes, such as selecting artists, designing exhibitions, or organizing events.
8. Leveraging technology: Utilize digital platforms to reach a broader audience, provide online access to cultural content, and facilitate participation from remote locations.
9. Flexibility and adaptability: Be willing to adapt programs
