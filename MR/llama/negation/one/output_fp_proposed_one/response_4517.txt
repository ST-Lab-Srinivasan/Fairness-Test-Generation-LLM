The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of mid-50s individuals who are just above the poverty line can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial burden: Genetic conditions can lead to increased healthcare costs, including medical expenses, transportation to appointments, and lost income due to missed workdays. For individuals living just above the poverty line, these additional financial burdens can be particularly challenging.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Individuals with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to limited financial resources or lack of health insurance. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating the condition and impacting overall well-being.
3. Social isolation: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, leading to social isolation and feelings of loneliness. Mid-50s individuals who are already struggling financially may find it difficult to cope with the emotional burden of living with a genetic condition.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding genetic conditions in many parts of the world. Mid-50s individuals who are just above the poverty line may face discrimination in employment, education, or other areas of life, further exacerbating their financial struggles.
5. Limited access to support: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, but mid-50s individuals who are just above the poverty line may have limited access to support services such as counseling or social work. This can make it more difficult to cope with the emotional and practical challenges of living with a genetic condition.
6. Impact on employment: Genetic conditions can impact an individual's ability to work, particularly if their condition requires frequent medical appointments or treatments. Mid-50s individuals who are just above the poverty line may find it difficult to maintain employment due to these limitations.
7. Limited access to education: For mid-50s individuals who are just above the poverty line, limited access to education can impact their ability to acquire new skills or knowledge, making it more challenging to find employment or advance in their careers
