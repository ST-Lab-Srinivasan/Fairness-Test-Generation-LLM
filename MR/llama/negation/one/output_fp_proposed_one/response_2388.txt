Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly married beginner non-Chinese speakers. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence their identities:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For newly married individuals who are beginners in Chinese, feeling a sense of belonging to the Chinese culture can help them navigate their new roles and responsibilities as spouses and parents.
2. Values and beliefs: Cultural heritage shapes the values and beliefs of individuals, including their attitudes towards marriage, family, and social relationships. For example, in some cultures, marriage is seen as a union between two families rather than just a union between two individuals. This can affect how newly married individuals view their roles and responsibilities within their marriage.
3. Traditions and customs: Cultural heritage includes a wide range of traditions and customs, such as wedding ceremonies, holidays, and rituals. These traditions can influence how newly married individuals view themselves and their place in society. For example, if a newly married individual comes from a culture that places a strong emphasis on filial piety, they may feel pressure to prioritize their parents' needs and expectations within their marriage.
4. Language and communication: Cultural heritage can also influence how individuals communicate with each other and express themselves. For example, in some cultures, directness and assertiveness are valued in communication, while in others, indirectness and subtlety are more appropriate. Newly married individuals who are beginners in Chinese may need to navigate these cultural differences in order to effectively communicate with their spouses and in-laws.
5. Food and cuisine: Cultural heritage can also shape how individuals view and participate in food culture. For example, if a newly married individual comes from a culture that places a strong emphasis on food and mealtime traditions, they may feel pressure to incorporate these traditions into their marriage and family life.
6. Rituals and ceremonies: Cultural heritage includes a wide range of rituals and ceremonies, such as wedding ceremonies, holidays, and religious observances. These can influence how newly married individuals view themselves and their place in society, as well as their relationships
