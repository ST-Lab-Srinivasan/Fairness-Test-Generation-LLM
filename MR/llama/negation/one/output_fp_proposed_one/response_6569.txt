Creating more inclusive community events for financially disadvantaged non-Arabic speakers can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help make these events more accessible and welcoming. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer free or low-cost tickets: Consider offering free or low-cost tickets to individuals who cannot afford the regular ticket price. This can be done through partnerships with local organizations, sponsorships, or by applying for grants.
2. Provide financial assistance: Offer financial assistance to individuals who cannot afford the ticket price. This can be done through scholarships, grants, or crowdfunding campaigns.
3. Use inclusive language: Make sure that all promotional materials and event communications are translated into multiple languages to reach a wider audience. This can include using images and videos that reflect the diversity of the community.
4. Accessible venue: Choose a venue that is accessible to people with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, audio descriptions, and braille signage.
5. Childcare and transportation: Provide childcare services or offer free or low-cost transportation options to make it easier for financially disadvantaged individuals to attend the event.
6. Interpretation and translation: Provide interpretation and translation services during the event, including American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, live captioning, and translated materials.
7. Flexible pricing: Offer flexible pricing options, such as sliding scale tickets or pay-what-you-can models, to make the event more accessible to people with different financial means.
8. Community outreach: Reach out to local community organizations that serve financially disadvantaged populations and work with them to promote the event and provide information about how to access it.
9. Prioritize content: Make sure that the content of the event is relevant and meaningful to the target audience, and that it addresses their needs and interests.
10. Follow-up: After the event, follow up with attendees to gather feedback and assess the impact of the event on the community. Use this information to improve future events and make them more inclusive.
