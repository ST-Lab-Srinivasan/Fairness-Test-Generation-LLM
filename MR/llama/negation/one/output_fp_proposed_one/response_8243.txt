Creating more inclusive community programs for non-civilian, non-long-time married individuals requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies to help create a more welcoming environment:

1. Acknowledge the diversity of community members: Recognize that your community is diverse and includes individuals who may not fit into traditional societal norms, such as being non-civilian or non-long-time married. Embrace this diversity and make sure everyone feels included.
2. Involve community members in decision-making processes: Encourage non-civilian and non-long-time married individuals to participate in community events, meetings, and decision-making processes. This will help them feel valued and included in the community.
3. Provide flexible programming options: Offer programs and activities that cater to different schedules, needs, and preferences of community members. For example, offer flexible meeting times or online events to accommodate individuals with non-traditional work hours or who live in remote areas.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for community members to connect with each other, such as social events or volunteer opportunities. This will help foster a sense of belonging and inclusivity among all community members.
5. Address cultural or identity-based differences: Be aware of cultural or identity-based differences within the community and make sure that programs are accessible and inclusive to everyone. For example, provide translation services or adapt programming to accommodate different cultural practices.
6. Use inclusive language and marketing: Ensure that all communication materials and marketing campaigns use inclusive language and imagery that reflects the diversity of your community. Avoid language or imagery that may be offensive or exclusionary.
7. Provide accommodations for accessibility needs: Ensure that programs and events are accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
8. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair non-civilian and non-long-time married individuals with experienced community members who can provide guidance and support in navigating community programs and events.
