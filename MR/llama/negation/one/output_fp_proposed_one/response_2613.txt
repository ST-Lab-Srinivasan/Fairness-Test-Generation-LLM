Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who are happily long-time married for many years. The cultural practices, values, and beliefs that an individual grows up with can have a profound impact on their sense of self and their place within their community.

These practices help shape their identities and create a sense of shared history and values. Similarly, for an Indian couple, cultural heritage may include Hinduism, Bollywood, or the Indian caste system, which all contribute to their identity as a couple.

Food is a universal language that can bridge cultural divides and create a sense of shared experience. Similarly, music, dance, or art can be used to express cultural identity and create a common ground between spouses.
