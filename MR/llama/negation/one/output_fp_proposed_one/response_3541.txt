Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-traditional wedded individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs of diverse communities: It's essential to listen to and learn from the experiences of non-traditional couples, such as interracial, LGBTQ+, or polyamorous ones. This will help you tailor your celebrations to their specific needs and preferences.
2. Be mindful of language and terminology: Avoid using language that may be offensive or exclusive. Instead, use inclusive terms that acknowledge the diversity of relationships and families. For example, instead of saying "bride" or "groom," you could use "partner" or "spouse."
