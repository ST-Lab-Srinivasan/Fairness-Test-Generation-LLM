Ensuring the educational needs of Native American students, including those who are natural-born US citizens and not part of any civilian population, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses historical trauma, cultural barriers, and systemic inequalities. Here are some strategies to help meet their educational needs:

2. Indigenous language revitalization: Support the revitalization of Indigenous languages by integrating language programs in schools, providing language classes for teachers, and promoting language immersion programs.
3. Traditional knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and practices into science and other curricula to help students understand the interconnectedness of human and natural systems.
4. Community-based education: Collaborate with Native American communities to develop educational programs that are grounded in their cultural values, beliefs, and practices. This can involve co-teaching, community field trips, and other hands-on learning experiences.
