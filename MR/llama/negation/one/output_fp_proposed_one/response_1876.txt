Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-native English speakers requires intentional design and consideration of their needs. Here are some strategies to make public spaces more welcoming:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide language interpretation services, such as live interpreters or translated materials, to ensure that non-native English speakers can access information and services.
2. Multilingual Signage: Use signs and labels in multiple languages to help non-native English speakers navigate public spaces. This can include street names, building directions, and emergency instructions.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences when designing public spaces. For example, consider the importance of eye contact in some cultures versus direct address in others.
4. Accessible Technology: Ensure that technology, such as digital displays and kiosks, is accessible to non-native English speakers by providing multiple language options or using image-based navigation.
5. Diverse Staffing: Train staff and volunteers to be culturally sensitive and proficient in multiple languages to better serve non-native English speakers.
6. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities and organizations that represent non-native English speakers to gather feedback and insights on how to make public spaces more inclusive.
7. Flexible Spaces: Create flexible spaces that can accommodate different cultural practices and preferences, such as designated prayer areas or quiet rooms for contemplation.
8. Education and Awareness: Offer workshops and training programs for the general public on how to interact with non-native English speakers in a respectful and inclusive manner.
9. Collaborative Design: Involve diverse communities in the design process to ensure that public spaces meet their needs and are more representative of the local population.
10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly gather feedback from non-native English speakers to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to create a more inclusive environment.

By implementing these strategies, public spaces can become more inclusive and welcoming for non-native English speakers, promoting greater social cohesion and community engagement.
