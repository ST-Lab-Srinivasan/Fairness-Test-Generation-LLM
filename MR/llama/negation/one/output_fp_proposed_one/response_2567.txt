Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-recently widowed individuals requires understanding and addressing the specific needs and concerns of this group. Here are some suggestions on how to create a more inclusive environment:

1. Understand and acknowledge the experiences of non-liberal individuals: Listen to their stories, understand their perspectives, and recognize the challenges they face. Acknowledge the history of marginalization and exclusion that has affected this group.
2. Involve non-liberal individuals in decision-making processes: Give them a voice in planning and organizing cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed and that they feel included in the process.
3. Provide accommodations and modifications: Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision. Modifications can include providing larger fonts or auditory displays for those with cognitive or learning disabilities.
4. Create safe spaces: Designate areas where non-liberal individuals can feel safe and comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be particularly important for individuals who may face discrimination or harassment in mainstream cultural celebrations.
5. Offer diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural celebration reflects the diversity of the community, including non-liberal individuals. Use images, symbols, and language that are inclusive and respectful of all cultures and identities.
6. Provide education and resources: Offer workshops or training sessions on cultural competency, inclusion, and diversity. Provide resources on how to create more inclusive environments for non-liberal individuals.
7. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Facilitate conversations between younger and older generations to promote understanding and respect across different cultures and identities.
8. Build bridges with other marginalized communities: Collaborate with other marginalized groups, such as racial or ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, or people with disabilities. By building alliances and fostering mutual support, cultural celebrations can become more inclusive and respectful of diverse identities.
