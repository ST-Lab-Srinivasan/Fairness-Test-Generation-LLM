Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Right-Leaning Non-Arabic Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and beliefs of individuals and communities. For right-leaning non-Arabic speakers, cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and shared values.

3. Nostalgia for the past: Several participants expressed nost
