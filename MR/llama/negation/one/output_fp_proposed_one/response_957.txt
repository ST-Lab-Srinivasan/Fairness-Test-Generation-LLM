Promoting the cultural preservation of extreme hardcore libertarian advanced over 90 years old (over 85) communities requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges and opportunities faced by these communities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Documentation and archiving: Collect and preserve oral histories, documents, and other artifacts related to the community's history, culture, and values. This can be done through interviews with elderly members of the community, documentation of cultural practices and traditions, and the creation of an archive that can be accessed by future generations.
2. Community outreach and engagement: Organize events and activities that bring together members of the community and encourage intergenerational dialogue and collaboration. This can help to build bridges between different age groups and foster a sense of shared identity and purpose.
3. Capacity building: Provide training and support to community leaders and members, enabling them to develop skills and knowledge that can help them preserve their cultural heritage and promote it to others. This can include workshops on cultural documentation, digital storytelling, and community development.
4. Collaboration with other organizations: Partner with other community groups, cultural institutions, and government agencies to leverage resources and expertise. This can help to amplify the community's voice and reach a wider audience.
5. Advocacy and policy engagement: Work with local and national policymakers to advocate for policies that support the preservation of cultural heritage and the rights of indigenous peoples. This can include initiatives to protect traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, and cultural practices from exploitation or erasure.
6. Digital storytelling: Use digital technologies to create interactive stories, games, and other multimedia experiences that showcase the community's history, culture, and values. This can help to engage younger generations and make the cultural heritage more accessible and relevant to them.
7. Cultural festivals and events: Organize cultural festivals and events that celebrate the community's traditions and practices. These events can help to build intergenerational connections and promote cultural preservation to a wider audience.
8. Education and outreach: Develop educational programs that teach younger generations about the community's history, culture, and values
