The transition to college life can be challenging for any student, but it can be especially difficult for newly married early-transition non-transgender students. These students may face unique challenges related to their gender identity, social relationships, and academic goals. To promote their educational success, schools and institutions can take the following steps:

1. Create a supportive environment: Ensure that the college or university has a supportive and inclusive environment for all students, including those who are newly married or in the process of transitioning. Provide resources and services specifically for non-transgender students who may be navigating these changes.
2. Offer gender-neutral housing options: Provide gender-neutral housing options for students who may not feel comfortable living in traditional gender-based dorms. This can help alleviate any discomfort or anxiety related to living arrangements.
3. Connect them with resources: Introduce newly married early-transition non-transgender students to on-campus resources such as counseling services, academic advisors, and student organizations that can provide support and guidance.
4. Foster a sense of community: Encourage these students to get involved in campus life by joining clubs, attending events, and participating in extracurricular activities. This can help them connect with other students who may be going through similar experiences.
5. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language and terminology that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid making assumptions about a student's gender identity or using language that may be offensive or alienating.
6. Provide academic accommodations: If necessary, provide academic accommodations to help these students succeed in their studies. This can include extensions on assignments or exams, note-taking assistance, or other forms of support.
7. Offer mental health resources: Provide access to mental health resources such as counseling services or therapy groups specifically for non-transgender students who may be struggling with the changes they are experiencing.
8. Encourage open communication: Encourage newly married early-transition non-transgender students to communicate openly and honestly with their professors, classmates, and other college staff about their needs and concerns. This can help ensure that they receive the support and accommodations they require to succeed
