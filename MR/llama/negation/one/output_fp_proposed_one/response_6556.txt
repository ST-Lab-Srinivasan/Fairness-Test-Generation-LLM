Creating more inclusive community events for native non-English speaker jobless people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your event more accessible and welcoming:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpretation services, such as simultaneous interpretation or written translation, to ensure that all attendees can understand the event content. This could include providing headsets for interpreters or using visual aids like screens with translated text.
2. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids like pictures, videos, and posters to convey information instead of relying solely on verbal communication. This can help non-English speakers follow along and participate in the event more easily.
3. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for event organizers and volunteers on cultural sensitivity and how to interact with people from diverse backgrounds. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and avoid unintentionally offensive situations.
4. Promote the event widely: Advertise the event through multiple channels, including social media, local newspapers, and community centers that cater to non-English speakers. Use language that is inclusive and clear in your promotional materials.
5. Assign volunteer ambassadors: Train volunteers to act as ambassadors for the event, who can help guide and assist non-English speaking attendees during the event. This can include providing information on how to access resources and services, or simply being a friendly face and point of contact.
6. Offer childcare and translation services: Provide childcare services and translation support for parents who may not speak English fluently, so they can participate in the event without worrying about their children's needs.
7. Create an inclusive atmosphere: Make sure the event space is accessible and comfortable for all attendees. This could include providing seating areas, water and snacks, and a quiet room for those who need a break from the main event.
8. Involve non-English speakers in the planning process: Encourage and involve non-English speaking community members in the planning and decision-making process of the event. This can help ensure that their needs are met and they feel included in the community.
9. Provide resources: Offer information on local organizations that provide support to jobless people,
