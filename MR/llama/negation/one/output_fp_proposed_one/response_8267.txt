Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent native Arabic speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive public spaces:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to non-independent native Arabic speakers by providing Braille signage, audio signals for important announcements, and large print materials. Provide assistive technology devices such as screen readers or voice recognition software to help individuals with disabilities navigate the space.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual staff to help non-independent native Arabic speakers communicate effectively in public spaces. Provide language classes or workshops to teach Arabic language skills to staff and volunteers who interact with this group.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural sensitivities and practices when designing and managing public spaces. For example, provide separate spaces for men and women, or ensure that food and drink are Halal-certified. This can help non-independent native Arabic speakers feel more comfortable and included in the space.
4. Social Inclusion: Create opportunities for social inclusion by hosting cultural events, workshops, or activities that cater to the needs of non-independent native Arabic speakers. Encourage intergenerational interactions and mentorship programs to foster a sense of community and belonging.
5. Technology Integration: Leverage technology to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces. For instance, provide interactive kiosks or tablets with visual or audio instructions for individuals who prefer to communicate through these means. Utilize virtual reality or augmented reality technologies to create immersive experiences that cater to the needs of non-independent native Arabic speakers.
6. Collaboration and Training: Work with organizations that specialize in serving non-independent native Arabic speakers to identify best practices and tailor solutions to their unique needs. Provide training for staff and volunteers on working with this population, including cultural competency and language support.
7. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from non-independent native Arabic speakers on how to improve public spaces
