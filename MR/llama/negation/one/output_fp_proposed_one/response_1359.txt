Regarding the challenges faced by native non-French speaker mixed African-American people in the legal system, it is important to acknowledge that the legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate for anyone, regardless of their background. However, there are specific challenges that may arise for individuals who are native non-French speakers in a predominantly French-speaking country, particularly when it comes to accessing legal services and resources.

Some of the challenges that native non-French speaker mixed African-American people may face in the legal system include:

1. Language barriers: As a non-French speaker, an individual may encounter difficulties in communicating with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who only speak French. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact the outcome of legal proceedings.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in France is influenced by French culture and values, which may not be familiar or comfortable for individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. This can lead to feelings of isolation or disconnection from the legal process.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or language proficiency still exists in many parts of the world, including France. Native non-French speaker mixed African-American people may face discrimination in the legal system, which can impact their access to justice.
4. Lack of representation: In some cases, native non-French speaker mixed African-American people may not have access to legal representation that speaks their language or understands their cultural background. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
5. Difficulty accessing resources: Depending on where they live in France, native non-French speaker mixed African-American people may face challenges accessing legal resources such as translation services, interpreters, or cultural sensitivity training
