Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native English speakers who are not independent, as it provides them with a sense of identity and belonging. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes the lives of these individuals:

1. Sense of Identity: Cultural heritage helps non-independent people form their identities. It influences how they perceive themselves, their values, beliefs, and behaviors.
