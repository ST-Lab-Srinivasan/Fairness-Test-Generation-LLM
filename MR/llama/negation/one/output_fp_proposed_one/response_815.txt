To ensure that the educational needs of deep-in-poverty, aged 65 and over 85 individuals are met, several strategies can be implemented:

1. Community-based programs: Develop community-based programs that cater to the specific needs of this population, such as literacy classes, computer training, or social activities. These programs can help older adults build social connections, improve their cognitive functioning, and enhance their overall well-being.
2. Collaboration with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that specialize in serving older adults to provide educational opportunities tailored to their needs. This could include working with senior centers, housing complexes, or other community hubs.
3. Online resources: Utilize online resources such as video tutorials, webinars, and e-learning courses to reach deep-in-poverty older adults who may face barriers in accessing traditional educational settings. This can help them access educational opportunities from the comfort of their own homes.
4. Outreach and referral services: Establish outreach programs that actively engage with deep-in-poverty older adults, identifying their educational needs and connecting them with appropriate resources. Referral services can also be established to connect these individuals with community-based programs or online resources.
5. Financial support: Offer financial assistance to deep-in-poverty older adults to cover the costs of educational programs or resources, such as tuition fees, textbooks, or technology expenses. This can help remove economic barriers that might prevent them from accessing education.
6. Personalized learning plans: Develop personalized learning plans tailored to the unique needs and goals of each individual. This could involve identifying areas of interest, developing a plan to address any cognitive challenges, or providing resources for mental health support.
7. Intergenerational programs: Create intergenerational programs that bring together older adults and younger generations, fostering mutual understanding and respect. These programs can help deep-in-poverty older adults build social connections and gain confidence in their abilities.
8. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address the systemic issues contributing to deep poverty among older adults, such as inadequate social safety nets
