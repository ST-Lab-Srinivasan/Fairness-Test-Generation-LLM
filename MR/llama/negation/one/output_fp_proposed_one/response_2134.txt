Here are some possible ways to ensure their voices are heard:

This can be especially important in situations where critical information is being discussed, such as financial decisions or legal matters.
2. Offer language support services: Organizations can offer language support services, such as language classes or interpretation services, to help non-Mandarin speaking individuals improve their language skills and participate more effectively in decision-making processes.

This can involve providing a comfortable and inclusive environment where individuals feel free to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination.
4. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encouraging a culture of inclusion within organizations can help ensure that the voices of non-Mandarin speaking, divorced multiple times individuals are heard. This can involve promoting diversity and inclusion initiatives, providing training on cultural competence and unconscious bias, and creating opportunities for individuals to share their experiences and perspectives.

For example, video conferencing tools can allow individuals to participate in meetings remotely, while translation software can help bridge language gaps.
