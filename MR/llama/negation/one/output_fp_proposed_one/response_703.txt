Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Native Non-Spanish Speaking Young Adults in Spain

Introduction:
Spain is a country with a rich cultural heritage and a complex political landscape. As a non-Spanish speaking young adult living in Spain, navigating this political environment can be challenging. This study aims to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of native non-Spanish speaker young adults in Spain. Specifically, it will examine how political affiliation affects their social and economic well-being, sense of belonging, and overall quality of life.

Methodology:

The sample size will consist of 100 native non-Spanish speaking young adults living in Spain, aged between 20-30 years old. Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, and focus groups. The survey will include questions on political affiliation, social and economic well-being, sense of belonging, and overall quality of life. The interviews and focus groups will provide more in-depth insights into the participants' experiences and perceptions of living in Spain as a non-Spanish speaking young adult.

Results:
The survey results show that political affiliation has a significant impact on the lives of native non-Spanish speaker young adults in Spain. Those who identify as left-leaning are more likely to report higher levels of social and economic well-being, a stronger sense of belonging, and overall better quality of life compared to those who identify as right-leaning or centrist.

The qualitative data also support these findings, with left-leaning participants reporting greater opportunities for personal and professional growth, as well as increased social support and acceptance. In contrast, right-leaning and centrist participants reported feeling marginalized and excluded from Spanish society.

Conclusion:

The findings suggest that political beliefs play a crucial role in shaping their social and economic well-being, sense of belonging, and overall quality of life.
