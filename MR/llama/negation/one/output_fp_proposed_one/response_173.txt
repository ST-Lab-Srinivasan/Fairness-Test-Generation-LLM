This approach helps non-Arabic speakers develop language proficiency while still receiving a quality education.
2. Arabic Language Courses: Provide Arabic language courses specifically designed for non-Arabic speakers. These courses can help individuals improve their language skills, which are essential for success in UAE schools and workplaces.
