Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not part of the middle class after their spouse's death requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Income support: Provide financial assistance to individuals who have lost their spouse, particularly those who are not part of the middle class. This could include a one-time payment or an ongoing monthly stipend to help them cover basic living expenses.
2. Housing support: Ensure that individuals have access to affordable and safe housing options, especially if they are facing financial difficulties after their spouse's death. This could involve providing rental subsidies or helping them find affordable housing options.
3. Healthcare support: Provide access to quality healthcare services, including mental health support, to help individuals cope with the loss of their spouse. This could involve providing free or low-cost healthcare services or connecting them with community resources that can provide emotional support.
4. Education and training: Offer educational and training opportunities to help individuals develop new skills and improve their employability. This could involve providing scholarships, vocational training programs, or job placement services.
5. Community support: Connect individuals with local communities and organizations that can provide emotional support, practical assistance, and social connections. This could involve organizing community events, creating support groups, or linking individuals with volunteer opportunities.
6. Legal support: Provide legal aid and support to help individuals navigate the legal system, including probate processes, estate administration, and inheritance rights.
7. Childcare support: Offer childcare services or financial assistance to help individuals who are raising children on their own after their spouse's death. This could involve providing subsidized childcare, parenting classes, or connecting them with community resources that can provide emotional support.
8. Transportation support: Provide transportation assistance, such as free or low-cost public transportation passes or car sharing services, to help individuals who are facing financial difficulties after their spouse's death.
