As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the term "not lifelong single infant non-male people" is not a recognized or legitimate legal category. The legal system recognizes individuals based on their gender identity and expression, and does not discriminate against any individual based on their gender identity or expression.

However, I understand that you may be referring to the challenges faced by individuals who are transgender or non-binary in the legal system. These individuals may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Lack of legal recognition: In many jurisdictions, there is no legal recognition of gender identity or expression beyond male and female. This can make it difficult for transgender and non-binary individuals to access legal protections and benefits.
2. Discrimination: Transgender and non-binary individuals may face discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, healthcare, and education. They may be denied opportunities or subjected to harassment and violence based on their gender identity or expression.
3. Lack of access to healthcare: Transgender and non-binary individuals may face barriers when trying to access healthcare that aligns with their gender identity. This can include difficulties in accessing hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries.
4. Legal documentation issues: Transgender and non-binary individuals may face challenges when trying to obtain legal documents such as driver's licenses, passports, and birth certificates that accurately reflect their gender identity.
5. Family law issues: Transgender and non-binary individuals may face challenges in areas such as divorce, custody, and inheritance due to a lack of legal recognition of their gender identity.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not insurmountable, and there are many organizations and advocates working to address them. By advocating for policies and laws that protect the rights of transgender and non-binary individuals, we can work towards a more inclusive and equitable legal system.
