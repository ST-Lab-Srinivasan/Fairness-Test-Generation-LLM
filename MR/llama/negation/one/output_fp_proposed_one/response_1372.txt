As a beginner non-Arabic speaking native recent immigrant to the US, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: The legal system in the US is primarily conducted in English, which can create a significant barrier for non-English speakers. You may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents, making it harder to navigate the system.
2. Lack of Knowledge about US Laws and Regulations: As a new immigrant, you may not be familiar with the laws and regulations of the US, which can lead to confusion and mistakes in navigating the legal system.
3. Difficulty Accessing Legal Resources: Non-Arabic speaking recent immigrants may find it challenging to access legal resources such as legal aid organizations, interpreters, and translated documents.
