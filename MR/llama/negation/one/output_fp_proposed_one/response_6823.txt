To promote the artistic talents of beginner non-French speaker late teenagers (ages 18-19), consider the following strategies:

1. Encourage creativity: Provide a supportive environment that fosters creativity and self-expression. Offer various art forms, such as drawing, painting, or writing, to explore different mediums and find what works best for each individual.

6. Showcase their work: Organize exhibitions, performances, or online showcases to display the learners' artwork. This will give them a platform to share their creations with a broader audience and gain recognition for their talents.
7. Provide feedback and constructive criticism: Offer regular feedback and constructive criticism to help the learners improve their skills. Be sure to highlight their strengths and provide actionable advice for growth.
8. Celebrate progress and achievements: Regularly acknowledge and celebrate the learners' progress and achievements, no matter how small. This will help build their confidence and motivation to continue learning and creating.
