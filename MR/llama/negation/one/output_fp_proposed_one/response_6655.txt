Creating more inclusive cultural events for freedom advocate non-mentally disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and inclusive:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals with different backgrounds, experiences, and abilities. This will help you better understand the needs of your attendees and create a more inclusive event.
2. Accessible venue: Choose a venue that is easily accessible for people with disabilities. This may include having wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
3. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as sign language interpreters, braille materials, or audio descriptions for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision.
4. Clear communication: Provide clear and concise information about the event through multiple channels, including social media, email, and website updates. Make sure to include details on accessibility features, schedules, and any other important information.
5. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by minimizing loud noises, bright lights, or strong smells that could be overwhelming for some attendees.
6. Flexible seating: Provide flexible seating options, such as designated quiet areas or sensory-friendly spaces, for attendees who may need a break from the main event.
7. Technology integration: Integrate technology, such as mobile apps or digital tools, to provide additional support and accessibility features for attendees. For example, you could use an app to provide real-time captions or audio descriptions.
8. Train staff: Provide training for staff and volunteers on disability etiquette, accessible event planning, and how to assist attendees with different needs.
9. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism to gather input from attendees on the accessibility of your events. Use this feedback to make improvements for future events.
10. Collaborate with disability organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to co-create and promote your events, ensuring that they are accessible and inclusive for all.
