To promote the artistic expression of non-elderly males and make it more inclusive, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Provide access to arts education: Ensure that schools and communities have access to quality arts education, including music, drama, and visual arts. This will help develop the skills and creativity of male artists at all levels.
2. Encourage diversity in arts programs: Make sure that arts programs are inclusive and representative of diverse voices and perspectives. This can be achieved by supporting initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion, such as mentorship programs, scholarships, and residencies for underrepresented artists.
3. Create platforms for non-elderly male artists: Establish platforms and opportunities for non-elderly male artists to showcase their work, such as exhibitions, festivals, and competitions. This will help increase visibility and recognition for these artists.
4. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent non-elderly male artists from fully participating in the art world, such as lack of access to resources, discrimination, or limited opportunities for networking and collaboration.
5. Support emerging artists: Encourage and support emerging non-elderly male artists by providing them with mentorship, resources, and opportunities for growth and development. This can be achieved through initiatives such as artist residencies, workshops, and exhibitions.
6. Promote intergenerational collaboration: Encourage collaboration between non-elderly male artists and older, more established artists to promote mentorship, knowledge sharing, and cross-generational creativity.
7. Foster a culture of support: Encourage a culture of mutual support and collaboration among non-elderly male artists, as well as with other stakeholders in the art world, such as curators, collectors, and critics. This can help create a more inclusive and nurturing environment for these artists to thrive.
8. Develop strategic partnerships: Establish partnerships with organizations that support the arts, such as government agencies, foundations, and cultural institutions. These partnerships can help provide resources, funding, and visibility for non-elderly male artists.
