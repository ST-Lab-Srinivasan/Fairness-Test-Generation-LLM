As a small-government advocate, cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of non-Mandarin individuals. Here are some ways:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage shapes the identity of non-Mandarin individuals by providing them with a sense of belonging and connection to their community. It helps them understand their place in society and their relationship with others.
2. Community engagement: Non-Mandarin individuals are more likely to participate in cultural events and activities that reflect their heritage, such as traditional festivals, music, and art. This fosters a sense of belonging and community engagement among these individuals.
3. Preservation of traditions: Small-government advocates often prioritize the preservation of cultural traditions and practices over government intervention. They believe that these traditions should be left to the communities themselves to preserve and pass down to future generations.
4. Economic growth: Cultural heritage can also play a role in economic growth by providing opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs to capitalize on cultural tourism. Non-Mandarin individuals may start their own cultural-themed businesses, such as museums, restaurants, or craft workshops, which can create jobs and stimulate local economies.
5. Resistance to government control: For small-government advocates, cultural heritage can serve as a symbol of resistance against government control and overreach. By preserving their cultural traditions and practices, non-Mandarin individuals can assert their independence and autonomy from the state.
6. Intercultural dialogue: Cultural heritage can facilitate intercultural dialogue and understanding among non-Mandarin individuals. By sharing and learning about each other's cultural practices, they can build bridges of mutual respect and empathy across linguistic and cultural divides.
7. Personal fulfillment: Non-Mandarin individuals may find personal fulfillment in preserving and passing down their cultural heritage to future generations. This can provide a sense of purpose and meaning in life, especially for those who feel marginalized or disconnected from mainstream society.
8. Community empowerment: By participating in the preservation and promotion of their cultural heritage, non-Mandarin individuals can feel empowered
