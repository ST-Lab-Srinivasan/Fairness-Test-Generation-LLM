Addressing the Needs of Bi-Orthodox Non-Jewish Individuals in Disaster Response: A Call to Inclusion and Respect

Disasters can affect anyone, regardless of their religious affiliation. However, bi-Orthodox individuals, who identify as both Jewish and not Jewish, may face unique challenges when seeking help during a disaster response. This article will explore the specific needs of bi-Orthodox individuals in disaster situations and provide recommendations for inclusive disaster response practices that respect their identities.
