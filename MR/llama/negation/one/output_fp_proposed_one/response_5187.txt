Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for late 30s native non-English speaker individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer multiple language support: Provide interpretation or translation services during events, such as live interpreters or pre-recorded translations. This will ensure that everyone can understand the content being presented.
2. Use visual aids: Incorporate visual aids, such as pictures and videos, to help convey information and cultural practices. This can be especially helpful for non-English speakers who may not be familiar with the language or customs of the host culture.
3. Provide accessibility accommodations: Make sure that event spaces are accessible to people with disabilities. This can include providing wheelchair access, audio descriptions, and braille materials.
4. Promote cultural exchange: Encourage cultural exchange between different groups by organizing events that bring people together. For example, host a potluck where participants can share their traditional dishes and learn about each other's culinary traditions.
5. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee represents a diverse range of cultures and backgrounds. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of all participants and that their needs are taken into account.
6. Create interactive experiences: Design events that allow participants to engage in interactive activities, such as cultural workshops or games. This can help non-English speakers learn about new cultures and customs in a fun and engaging way.
7. Use technology: Utilize technology to provide additional support for non-English speakers. For example, create virtual events or use online platforms to provide language translation services.
8. Foster inclusive language: Encourage the use of inclusive language during events. This can help create a welcoming environment for all participants and avoid unintentionally excluding non-English speakers.
9. Provide cultural orientation: Offer cultural orientation sessions or workshops to help non-English speakers understand the customs and practices of the host culture. This can include information on etiquette, traditions, and rituals.
10. Encourage feedback: Solicit feedback from participants throughout the planning process to ensure that their needs are being met and that the celebration is inclusive for everyone.
