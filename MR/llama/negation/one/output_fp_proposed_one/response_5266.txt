Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for Native American and recent immigrant communities in the US requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to and learn from the communities you aim to include. Understand their traditions, beliefs, and values, and be open to learning from them.
2. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be aware of the potential for cultural appropriation and avoid using elements of Native American or immigrant cultures in a way that is disrespectful or insensitive. Instead, seek to learn from and honor these cultures.
3. Involve community members: Involve community members in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that the celebrations are inclusive and representative of the diverse communities involved.
4. Create intercultural spaces: Create spaces where people from different cultural backgrounds can come together to share their traditions, practices, and beliefs. This can involve creating multicultural events or spaces where people can learn from and appreciate each other's cultures.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Foster cross-cultural understanding by promoting dialogue, mutual respect, and empathy between different cultural groups. Encourage people to share their experiences and perspectives with each other.
6. Avoid stereotypes: Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing dominant cultural narratives that marginalize Native American or immigrant communities. Instead, seek to challenge these narratives and promote a more inclusive and respectful understanding of these cultures.
7. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of cultures involved in the celebration by highlighting the unique traditions, practices, and beliefs of each community. This can involve showcasing traditional music, dance, art, and food from different cultural backgrounds.
8. Create inclusive language: Use inclusive language that acknowledges and respects the diverse cultures involved in the celebration. Avoid using language that is offensive or marginalizing to any particular group.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be mindful of power dynamics within the communities involved in the celebration. Seek to empower marginalized voices and
