Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native non-French speaker ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to the Community: Start by listening to the needs and concerns of the Asian community. Conduct surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews to understand their cultural preferences, values, and barriers to participation. This will help you design programs that are relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Involve the Community: Involve the Asian community in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. Encourage them to take an active role in shaping the content and delivery of the programs. This can be done by forming advisory committees or task forces made up of community representatives.
3. Provide Multilingual Materials: Provide multilingual materials, such as brochures, posters, and signage, to cater to the language needs of non-French speaker ethnically full Asians. This will help them navigate the cultural programs with ease.
4. Offer Cultural Workshops: Offer cultural workshops that are tailored to the specific needs and interests of the Asian community. These workshops can cover topics such as traditional music, dance, art, and cuisine from various Asian cultures.
5. Simultaneous Interpretation: Provide simultaneous interpretation services during cultural programs to enable non-French speaker ethnically full Asians to fully participate in the events. This can be done through the use of headsets or by providing interpreters on site.
6. Accessibility Features: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to people with disabilities by providing features such as wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and audio descriptions.
7. Flexible Programming: Offer flexible programming that caters to the diverse needs of the Asian community. For example, offering programs at different times or locations to accommodate different schedules and preferences.
8. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to raise awareness about the cultural programs and encourage participation from the Asian community. This can be done through flyers, posters, social media campaigns, or community events.
9. Collaboration with Community Organ
