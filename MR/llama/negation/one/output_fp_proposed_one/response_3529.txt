Creating more inclusive community events for very old (90s+) non-temporary workers requires careful consideration and planning to ensure their participation and well-being. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is accessible to older adults with mobility issues. Provide parking, ramps, and bathrooms that are easily accessible. Offer transportation options for those who may need it.
2. Programming: Offer programs and activities that cater to the interests and abilities of older adults. This could include arts and crafts, music, storytelling, or educational workshops. Consider offering modifications for individuals with hearing or vision impairments.
3. Volunteer Support: Recruit volunteers who are familiar with the needs and preferences of older adults. These volunteers can help with registration, guiding attendees around the event space, and providing support during activities.
4. Communication: Provide clear and concise communication about the event, including details on programming, schedules, and any necessary instructions. Consider using large print or Braille materials for individuals with visual impairments.
5. Food and Beverage: Offer a variety of food and beverage options that cater to dietary restrictions and preferences of older adults. Consider providing smaller portions or individual servings to accommodate different eating abilities.
6. Social Interaction: Create opportunities for social interaction, such as group activities or opportunities to connect with other attendees. This can help reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness among older adults.
7. Technology Support: Provide technology support, such as audio descriptions or closed captioning, to ensure that all attendees can fully participate in the event.
8. Inclusive Marketing: Promote the event through inclusive marketing materials, highlighting the accessibility features and accommodations available. Encourage word-of-mouth promotion from older adults who have attended previous events.
9. Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that serve older adults to promote the event and encourage attendance. This can help build a sense of community and support for older adults.
10. Evaluation and Feedback: Gather feedback from attendees,
