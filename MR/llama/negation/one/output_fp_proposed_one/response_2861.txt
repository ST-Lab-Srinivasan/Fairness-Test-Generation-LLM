Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Converted Devout Practicing Non-Hindus

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently converted devout practicing non-Hindus. As individuals convert to Hinduism, they bring with them their own cultural backgrounds and belief systems, which intersect with Hindu culture and shape their understanding and practice of the religion. This paper will explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of these newly converted individuals and how they navigate their dual identities as both non-Hindus and Hindus.

They may face challenges in reconciling their cultural heritage with their newfound religious identity.
