The impact of a family member's disability on the lives of non-mentally disabled active-duty personnel can be significant and varied. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Emotional toll: Caring for a family member with a disability can be emotionally challenging, particularly if the non-mentally disabled family member feels overwhelmed or frustrated by the caregiving responsibilities.
2. Financial strain: Disabilities can result in increased medical expenses, lost income due to reduced work hours or job loss, and higher living costs associated with accommodating the person's needs. These financial challenges can impact the non-mentally disabled family member's own well-being and ability to participate in activities they enjoy.

4. Impact on relationships: Disability can strain relationships within the family, particularly if the non-mentally disabled family member feels resentful about the added responsibilities or emotional burden of caring for a loved one.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Non-mentally disabled family members may experience stigma or discrimination due to societal attitudes towards disability, leading to feelings of shame or isolation.
6. Lack of support: Non-mentally disabled family members may feel unsupported by their military chain of command or other resources, particularly if they are not recognized as caregivers themselves.
