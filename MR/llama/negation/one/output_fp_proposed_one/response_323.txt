I must clarify that the term "mixed-Caucasian heritage" is a social construct, and it does not reflect the full complexity of an individual's identity or experiences. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are not binary or mutually exclusive categories, but rather a spectrum of identities that are shaped by a variety of factors, including ancestry, culture, history, and personal identity.

That being said, non-independent mixed-race individuals in the healthcare system may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis: Mixed-race individuals may be misclassified or underserved based on their race or ethnicity. For example, they may be assumed to be a different race or ethnicity than they identify with, leading to inaccurate diagnoses or treatments.
2. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of mixed-race individuals, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of their health needs.
3. Discrimination: Mixed-race individuals may experience discrimination in the healthcare system based on their race or ethnicity. This can include being perceived as less deserving of care or experiencing bias from healthcare providers.
4. Identity issues: Mixed-race individuals may struggle with their identity and sense of belonging, which can affect their mental and physical health. They may feel caught between different cultural worlds or feel like they don't fit into any one category.
5. Stigma: Mixed-race individuals may experience stigma based on their race or ethnicity, which can lead to feelings of shame or inadequacy. This can affect their ability to access healthcare services or disclose their identity to healthcare providers.
6. Limited access to care: Mixed-race individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to systemic issues such as lack of cultural competency, language barriers, or discrimination.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Mixed-race individuals may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system, particularly if they are not familiar with the language or customs of the healthcare providers.
8. Lack of representation
