Supporting the economic empowerment of Native natural-born US non-citizen upper lower middle-income individuals is crucial for promoting financial stability and reducing poverty in the United States. Here are some ways to support their economic empowerment:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many Native communities lack access to traditional banking services, making it difficult for individuals to save money, take out loans, or start a business. Implementing mobile banking services or partnering with local credit unions can help provide financial accessibility.
2. Business Development: Supporting entrepreneurship in Native communities can create jobs and generate income. Providing training and resources for starting and growing a business can help individuals build wealth and achieve financial stability.
3. Education and Job Training: Investing in education and job training programs can help individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability. This can lead to higher earning potential and increased economic mobility.
4. Housing Support: Many Native communities struggle with affordable housing, which can limit financial opportunities. Providing subsidies or support for homeownership can help individuals build wealth through home ownership.
5. Healthcare Access: Improving access to healthcare can help reduce medical expenses and improve overall well-being. Expanding Medicaid coverage or providing healthcare resources specifically tailored for Native communities can help achieve this goal.
6. Land Management: Many Native communities have limited control over their land, which can limit economic opportunities. Supporting land management initiatives that prioritize tribal sovereignty and self-determination can help create more economic opportunities for individuals within those communities.
7. Microfinance Programs: Providing microfinance programs that offer small loans or other financial services to entrepreneurs and start-ups in Native communities can help stimulate local economies and promote job creation.
8. Tax Credits: Offering tax credits or deductions specifically designed for Native-owned businesses can help stimulate economic growth within those communities.
9. Workforce Development: Investing in workforce development programs that prioritize the hiring and training of Native Americans can help increase employment opportunities and improve overall economic well-being.
