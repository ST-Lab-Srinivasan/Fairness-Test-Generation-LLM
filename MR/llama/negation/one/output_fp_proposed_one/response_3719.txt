As an ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that promoting the cultural integration of any group of people, including non-permanent resident extreme soft libertarians, is a complex and multifaceted task that requires careful consideration and respect for individual rights and freedoms. Here are some potential strategies that could be explored:

1. Education and awareness-raising: Provide educational resources and workshops that promote understanding and acceptance of diverse cultures, beliefs, and lifestyles. This can help to break down barriers and stereotypes, and foster a more inclusive and accepting environment.
2. Community engagement: Encourage non-permanent resident extreme soft libertarians to participate in community events and activities, such as cultural festivals, volunteer work, or social gatherings. This can help to build bridges between different groups and promote a sense of belonging.
3. Advocacy and support: Work with organizations that advocate for the rights and interests of non-permanent resident extreme soft libertarians, and provide support and resources for individuals who may be facing discrimination or marginalization.
4. Policy reforms: Advocate for policy changes that promote the cultural integration of non-permanent resident extreme soft libertarians, such as providing pathways to citizenship or residency for these individuals, and protecting their rights and freedoms under the law.
5. Intersectionality and allyship: Recognize that cultural integration is intertwined with other forms of oppression, such as racism, sexism, and homophobia. Work to dismantle these systems of oppression by listening to and centering the voices of marginalized communities, and by being an ally and advocate for their rights and interests.
6. Fostering dialogue and empathy: Encourage open and respectful dialogue between different groups, and work to foster empathy and understanding between individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives. This can help to build bridges and promote a more inclusive and equitable society.
7. Challenging stereotypes and biases: Work to challenge and dismantle stereotypes and biases that perpetuate discrimination and marginalization
