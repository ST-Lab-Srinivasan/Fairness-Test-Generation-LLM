3. Inclusive spaces: Create inclusive spaces for community gatherings, such as multipurpose rooms or outdoor spaces that are accessible and welcoming to all.
4. Interfaith dialogue: Organize interfaith dialogues and discussions that bring together members of different religious communities to promote mutual understanding and respect.
5. Community outreach: Reach out to Native recent immigrant communities through community events, outreach programs, and partnering with local organizations that serve these populations.
6. Support for religious practices: Be supportive of the religious practices and traditions of the Native recent immigrant community, such as providing space for prayer or meditation, or accommodating dietary restrictions.
7. Education and awareness: Educate community members about the customs and beliefs of the Native recent immigrant community through workshops, presentations, or cultural events.
8. Leadership opportunities: Provide leadership opportunities for members of the Native recent immigrant community to take on roles in the community, such as leading prayers or participating in decision-making processes.
