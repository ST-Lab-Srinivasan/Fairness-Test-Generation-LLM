Cultural competence is an essential aspect of healthcare, especially for beginner Chinese speakers who are immigrants or non-citizens of the United States. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds, including those who may not speak English fluently. Healthcare providers can use interpreters or translators to facilitate communication and build trust with their patients.
