The impact of immigration status on the lives of physically disabled, recently non-divorced individuals who have been married multiple times can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Disabled individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be concerned about seeking medical attention or experiencing delays in receiving necessary treatment.
2. Employment opportunities: Discrimination based on immigration status can limit the job opportunities available to disabled individuals, making it difficult for them to find stable and fulfilling employment.
3. Social isolation: Disabled individuals who are undocumented or have precarious immigration status may experience social isolation due to fear of deportation or stigma associated with their immigration status.
4. Housing instability: Disabled individuals may face difficulties in securing affordable and accessible housing, particularly if they are undocumented. They may be at risk of homelessness or housing insecurity.
5. Transportation challenges: Disabled individuals who are undocumented may face barriers in accessing transportation services, such as public transportation, due to their immigration status.
6. Limited access to social security benefits: Disabled individuals who are undocumented may be excluded from accessing social security benefits, such as disability benefits, due to their immigration status.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Disabled individuals who are undocumented may experience stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status, which can further marginalize and isolate them.
8. Limited access to education: Disabled individuals who are undocumented may face barriers in accessing education services, including higher education, due to their immigration status.
9. Lack of legal protection: Disabled individuals who are undocumented may lack legal protections, such as workers' compensation or disability rights laws, which can leave them vulnerable to discrimination and abuse.
10. Mental health impacts: The stress and uncertainty associated with living with precarious immigration status can have significant mental health impacts on disabled individuals, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
