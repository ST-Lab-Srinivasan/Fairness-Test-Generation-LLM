Long-term widows, especially those who are non-Arabic speakers, face significant challenges in the job market in the UAE. Here are some of the common difficulties they encounter:

1. Language barrier: Many long-term widows may not speak Arabic fluently, which can limit their job opportunities in a country where the official language is Arabic. This can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively with potential employers or colleagues.
2. Limited access to job opportunities: Widows may have limited access to job opportunities due to various factors such as lack of job experience, skills, or education. In addition, they may face discrimination or bias based on their marital status.
