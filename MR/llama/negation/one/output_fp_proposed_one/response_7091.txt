Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native non-Spanish speaker mixed Asian heritage individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning and implementation of cultural programs involve diverse perspectives, including those of mixed Asian heritage individuals themselves. This can be achieved by actively seeking out their input and feedback throughout the process.
2. Avoid stereotyping: Be mindful of avoiding stereotypes or assumptions based on an individual's race or ethnicity. Instead, focus on creating programs that celebrate the diversity of Asian cultures and promote understanding and appreciation of the unique experiences and perspectives of mixed Asian heritage individuals.
3. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services for cultural programs to ensure that non-Spanish speaker mixed Asian heritage individuals can fully participate and understand the content.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Design cultural programs and spaces that are welcoming and inclusive of all participants, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This can involve using visuals and materials that reflect the diversity of Asian cultures and avoiding any elements that might feel exclusionary.
5. Offer cross-cultural learning opportunities: Provide opportunities for mixed Asian heritage individuals to learn about and engage with different Asian cultures, helping them develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of their own cultural identity.
6. Foster dialogue and community building: Encourage open dialogue and community building among mixed Asian heritage individuals and other participants. This can help create a sense of belonging and promote cross-cultural understanding and respect.
7. Address microaggressions: Be aware of potential microaggressions or unconscious biases that may arise during cultural programs, and address them promptly and respectfully.
8. Provide accessibility options: Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or other accessibility options to ensure that all participants can fully engage in cultural programs.
9. Celebrate mixed identities: Embrace the diversity of mixed Asian heritage individuals and celebrate their unique identities and experiences. Avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or assumptions based on race or ethnicity.
