Ensuring the financial well-being of elderly immigrants, including those who are non-citizens and have been in the United States for more than 90 years, can be a complex issue. Here are some potential strategies that could be explored:

1. Access to Social Security Benefits: Many elderly immigrants are eligible for Social Security benefits but may face barriers to accessing them due to their immigration status. The government could work towards simplifying the process of applying for Social Security benefits and providing more resources to help immigrant seniors navigate the system.
2. Financial Assistance Programs: Developing financial assistance programs specifically designed for elderly immigrants, including those who are non-citizens, could help meet their financial needs. These programs could provide financial support for basic necessities such as housing, food, and healthcare.
3. Public Benefits Access: Immigrant seniors may be eligible for public benefits such as Medicaid, but they may face barriers to accessing them due to their immigration status. The government could work towards simplifying the process of applying for these benefits and providing more resources to help immigrant seniors navigate the system.
4. Community-Based Care: Developing community-based care programs that provide support for elderly immigrants, including those who are non-citizens, could help meet their financial needs. These programs could include in-home care, adult day care, and other forms of support.
5. Advocacy and Outreach: Immigrant advocacy groups and community organizations could play a crucial role in raising awareness about the financial challenges faced by elderly immigrants and advocating for policies that address these needs. Outreach efforts could be focused on reaching vulnerable populations, such as those who are non-citizens and have been in the US for more than 90 years.
6. Public Education Campaigns: Launching public education campaigns targeted towards immigrant communities could help raise awareness about the financial resources available to elderly immigrants, including those who are non-citizens. These campaigns could provide information on how to access financial assistance programs and how to plan for retirement.
7. Collaboration with Community Organizations:
