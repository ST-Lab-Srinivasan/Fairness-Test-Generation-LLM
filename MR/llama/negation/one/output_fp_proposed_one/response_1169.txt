Creating more inclusive community events for reservist non-Mexican people requires intentional effort and consideration. Here are some strategies to help make your events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Understand and acknowledge the history and culture of the reservist communities you are working with. This includes learning about their traditional practices, beliefs, and values. Be mindful of how these factors may impact your event planning and execution.
2. Involve reservist community members in the planning process. This can help ensure that the event is tailored to meet their needs and preferences. Consider forming a diverse planning committee that represents different perspectives and backgrounds.
3. Provide translation services for non-Mexican attendees. Offer interpreters or translators who can facilitate communication between English and other languages spoken by reservist communities. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and understood.
4. Be mindful of accessibility needs. Ensure that the event location is accessible to people with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
5. Offer childcare services or create a kid-friendly environment. Many reservist communities place a high value on family and community, so consider providing childcare services or creating a space that is welcoming and safe for children.
6. Incorporate traditional music, dance, and food into the event. This can help celebrate the cultural heritage of reservist communities and create a sense of belonging among attendees.
7. Provide educational materials in different languages. Offer translated materials that explain the purpose and goals of the event, as well as any other relevant information.
8. Encourage representation and storytelling. Give reservist community members opportunities to share their stories and experiences through speeches, presentations, or interactive activities. This can help foster a sense of belonging and inclusivity among attendees.
9. Offer cultural workshops or activities. Consider offering traditional craft-making, dancing, or other cultural activities that are meaningful to reservist communities. This can help create a fun and engaging experience for all attendees.
10. Follow up with attendees after the event. Show appreciation for their attendance and involvement
