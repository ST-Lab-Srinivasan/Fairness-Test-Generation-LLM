Supporting the social inclusion of native Chinese speaker non-independent people can be achieved through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language Training: Provide language training programs tailored to their needs, which can help them improve their communication skills and build confidence in using Chinese language.
2. Cultural Awareness: Organize cultural awareness workshops or events that promote understanding and appreciation of Chinese culture, history, and customs. This can help bridge the gap between native Chinese speakers and non-independent people.
3. Social Gatherings: Host social gatherings or events specifically designed for native Chinese speakers, such as potluck dinners, movie nights, or game nights. These events can provide opportunities for them to interact with others who share similar experiences and backgrounds.
4. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that match native Chinese speakers with experienced professionals or peers who can offer guidance and support in navigating social situations, finding employment, or accessing resources.
5. Community Outreach: Collaborate with community organizations or groups to reach out to native Chinese speakers who may be isolated or struggling to connect with others. Offer workshops or activities that promote socialization and inclusion.
6. Volunteer Opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for native Chinese speakers to engage in community service, such as tutoring, mentoring, or assisting with cultural events. This can help build their confidence and sense of belonging.
7. Accessibility Supports: Ensure that social events, workshops, or training programs are accessible to native Chinese speakers with disabilities by providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, or braille materials.
8. Inclusive Spaces: Create inclusive spaces for native Chinese speakers, such as community centers, libraries, or cafes, where they can feel comfortable and included.
9. Advocacy: Raise awareness about the social inclusion of native Chinese speakers through advocacy campaigns, media outreach, or partnering with organizations that support this cause.
10. Building Alliances: Collaborate with other organizations or groups that support the social inclusion of diverse populations to build a stronger network and amplify efforts.
