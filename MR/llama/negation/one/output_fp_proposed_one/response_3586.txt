Regarding the challenges faced by non-Arabic speaker people in the legal system, there are several issues that may arise, including:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who do not speak Arabic may face difficulties navigating the legal system in countries where the language is the primary language of communication. This can include understanding court proceedings, interpreting legal documents, and communicating with lawyers and other legal professionals.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Non-Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as translation services or interpretive assistance, which can hinder their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on language proficiency is not uncommon in many legal systems. Non-Arabic speakers may face discrimination or be at a disadvantage in the legal system due to their limited proficiency in the language.
4. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system can be complex and nuanced, and cultural competency is an important factor in navigating it effectively. Non-Arabic speakers may face challenges in understanding cultural norms and practices that are relevant to their legal issues.
5. Difficulty in finding legal representation: Non-Arabic speakers may have difficulty finding legal representation, as many lawyers may not be proficient in languages other than Arabic. This can make it difficult for them to access legal advice and support.

Overall, the challenges faced by non-Arabic speaker people in the legal system can be significant, and it is important to address these issues in order to ensure that everyone has equal access to justice.
