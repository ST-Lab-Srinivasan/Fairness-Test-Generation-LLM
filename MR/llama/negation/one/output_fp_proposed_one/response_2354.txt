To address the specific needs of Native American non-citizen widows who have been living in the United States for a long time and lack basic self-taught skills, consider the following strategies:

1. Cultural sensitivity and adaptability: Develop programs that are tailored to the unique cultural backgrounds and traditions of Native American communities. This may involve incorporating traditional practices and beliefs into skill-building activities.
2. Accessibility and outreach: Ensure that program locations and materials are accessible to participants, many of whom may not have reliable transportation or access to technology. Outreach efforts can also help raise awareness about the programs and their benefits among Native American communities.
3. Language support: Provide language support for participants who may not speak English fluently. This could involve offering classes in native languages or providing interpretation services during program activities.
4. Flexibility and individualized support: Recognize that each participant has unique needs and circumstances. Offer flexible programming that can accommodate different learning styles, paces, and goals. Provide one-on-one support and mentorship to help participants overcome specific challenges or obstacles.
5. Community engagement and collaboration: Work with local Native American communities and organizations to build trust and leverage existing networks. Collaborate on program development and implementation to ensure that the programs are responsive to community needs.
6. Traditional knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and practices into skill-building activities, such as gardening, hunting, or craft-making. This can help participants connect with their cultural heritage and develop practical skills that are relevant to their lives.
7. Mentorship and support networks: Establish mentorship programs that pair experienced participants with newcomers. This can provide a sense of community and belonging, as well as opportunities for guidance and support.
8. Technology integration: Leverage technology to reach participants who may not have access to in-person programming. This could involve creating online courses or providing digital resources and tools for skill development.
9. Prioritizing safety and well-being: Ensure that programs prioritize the safety and well-being of participants, particularly those who may be experiencing trauma or violence. Provide access to mental health resources and create a safe and supportive environment for all participants.
