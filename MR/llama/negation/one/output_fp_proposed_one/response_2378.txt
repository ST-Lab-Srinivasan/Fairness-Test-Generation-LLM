Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for beginner Chinese speakers, especially those who are partially non-asexual, requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Encourage participation from various members of the community, including those who may not be fluent in Chinese. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
2. Provide language support: Offer translation support or provide English subtitles for cultural events to make them more accessible to non-Chinese speakers.
3. Incorporate diverse elements: Incorporate cultural elements from different regions of China, as well as from other cultures, to create a rich and inclusive celebration.
4. Avoid stereotypes: Be mindful of stereotypes and clich√©s when planning cultural events. Instead, focus on showcasing the diversity and complexity of Chinese culture.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Organize cultural exchange programs or workshops where participants can learn about each other's cultures and traditions.
6. Create a safe space: Ensure that all participants feel comfortable and included during cultural celebrations. Encourage respectful dialogue and avoid any behavior that may be perceived as offensive or exclusive.
7. Be inclusive in language: When communicating about cultural events, use language that is inclusive of all participants, regardless of their proficiency in Chinese.
8. Offer accessibility options: Provide accommodations for participants with disabilities, such as wheelchair accessibility or sign language interpretation.
9. Encourage participation: Encourage all participants to actively participate in cultural events, regardless of their level of Chinese proficiency. This can be done through interactive activities or games that promote cultural understanding and exchange.
10. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of any power imbalances within the community and strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.

By following these suggestions, you can create more inclusive cultural celebrations for beginner Chinese speakers, promoting cross-cultural understanding and mutual respect among all participants.
