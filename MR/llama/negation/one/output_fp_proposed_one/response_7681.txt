As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to avoid making generalizations or assumptions about any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, nationality, or immigration status. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.

That being said, there are certain data-driven strategies that can help highlight the issues faced by non-citizen individuals in India who are not from a lower middle-income background. Here are some examples:

1. Survey research: Conduct surveys among non-citizen individuals in India to gather data on their experiences and challenges. This could include questions on their access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities, as well as any discrimination or marginalization they may have faced.
2. Statistical analysis: Analyze existing data sources, such as census data, survey research, and administrative records, to identify trends and patterns in the experiences of non-citizen individuals in India. This could help identify areas where these individuals are disproportionately affected by poverty, inequality, or other social and economic issues.
3. Case studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of specific non-citizen communities in India to gather detailed information on their experiences and challenges. This could involve conducting interviews, focus groups, or other qualitative research methods to gather rich, nuanced data.
4. Mapping and spatial analysis: Use geospatial techniques to map the locations where non-citizen individuals live and work, and analyze how these areas are affected by poverty, inequality, and other social and economic factors. This could help identify patterns of distribution and concentration of non-citizen populations, and how these populations are connected to larger social and economic systems.
5. Data visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present the findings of the research in a clear and compelling way. This could involve creating maps, charts, and other visualizations that help illustrate the experiences and challenges faced by non-citizen individuals in India.

By using these data-driven strategies, it may be possible to highlight the issues faced by non-citizen individuals in India who are not from a lower middle-income background, and to identify potential solutions for addressing these issues. However, it is
