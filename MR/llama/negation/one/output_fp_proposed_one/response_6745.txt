Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian, non-widowed individuals requires understanding and addressing the specific needs and concerns of this group. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Involve diverse groups in planning and decision-making processes: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and belief systems. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of everyone's needs and preferences.
2. Provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities: Make sure that the venue and activities are accessible to people with disabilities. This can include providing wheelchair accessibility, audio describers or sign language interpreters, and accessible food options.
3. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be respectful of different cultures' traditions and practices during the celebration. For example, if you are hosting a cultural event that includes food, make sure to provide Halal or Kosher options for Muslim or Jewish attendees.
4. Offer gender-neutral and inclusive language: Use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity. Provide gender-neutral restrooms or create a safe space for individuals who identify as non-binary or genderqueer.
5. Be aware of the impact of cultural celebrations on marginalized groups: Acknowledge the historical and systemic oppression that marginalized groups have faced during cultural celebrations. Take steps to address these issues, such as incorporating stories and traditions from underrepresented cultures or providing education and resources on how to be an ally.
6. Encourage participation from all attendees: Make sure that everyone feels included and involved in the celebration. Encourage attendees to share their stories, traditions, and practices during the event.
7. Provide language support: Offer translation services or interpretation during the celebration for individuals who may not speak the dominant language.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the power dynamics that exist within different cultural groups and work to create an inclusive space where everyone feels valued and respected.
9. Create a safe space for LGBTQ+ individuals: Provide a safe space for LGBTQ+ individuals to express themselves
