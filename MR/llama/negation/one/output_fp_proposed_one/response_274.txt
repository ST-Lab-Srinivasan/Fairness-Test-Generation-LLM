The term "Native" is often used to refer to people who are indigenous to a particular region or country, and in this context, it is likely that you are referring to Native Americans. However, it is important to recognize that the term "Native" can be problematic and reduce the complexity of Indigenous identities.

To support the economic empowerment of Native American non-citizen upper middle-income individuals, there are several strategies that can be pursued:

1. Education and Training: Providing access to quality education and training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market and advance their careers. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and higher education programs.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Encouraging entrepreneurship and providing resources and support for starting and growing businesses can help individuals build wealth and create economic opportunities in their communities. This can include access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Access to Capital: Native American communities have historically faced barriers to accessing capital and credit, which has hindered economic development. Addressing these barriers and providing access to capital through community development financial institutions (CDFIs) or other means can help individuals start and grow businesses.
4. Job Creation: Job creation programs that target Native American communities can help address unemployment and underemployment. These programs can include job training, placement services, and entrepreneurship support.
5. Land Rights and Resource Management: Many Native American communities have been impacted by the loss of land and resources due to historical trauma and ongoing systemic inequality. Addressing these issues through land restoration, resource management, and economic development can help individuals and communities build wealth and achieve economic self-determination.
6. Cultural Preservation: Economic empowerment is intertwined with cultural preservation. Supporting the preservation of Native American cultures and traditions can help individuals and communities maintain their identity and connection to their land and resources.
7. Community Development: Building vibrant, resilient communities that support economic development requires a comprehensive approach that addresses social, cultural, and economic needs. This can include community planning, infrastructure development, and social services.
8. Advocacy and Policy Change
