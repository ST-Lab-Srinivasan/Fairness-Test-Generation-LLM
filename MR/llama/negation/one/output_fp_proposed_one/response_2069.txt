Creating more inclusive community events for non-civilian upper lower middle-income people requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that event organizers can consider:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of your target audience: Conduct research to identify the interests, preferences, and needs of the non-civilian upper lower middle-income population. This will help you tailor your events to meet their unique requirements.
2. Offer affordable tickets and pricing options: Make sure that your event tickets are affordable and accessible to a wide range of people. Consider offering discounts or scholarships for non-civilian upper lower middle-income individuals, especially those who may not have the financial means to attend events at higher price points.
3. Provide accessible venues and facilities: Ensure that your event location is accessible and inclusive for all attendees, including those with disabilities. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or Braille materials for attendees who may have specific accessibility needs.
4. Promote diversity and inclusion in event marketing: Use diverse imagery and messaging in your promotional materials to showcase the inclusivity of your event. Highlight the unique perspectives and experiences of your target audience, and emphasize the value of their participation.
5. Offer childcare and other support services: Recognize that many non-civilian upper lower middle-income individuals may have family responsibilities or other obligations that can make it challenging to attend events without support. Provide childcare services, transportation options, or other support services to help attendees feel more comfortable and included.
6. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for attendees to connect with one another and build relationships. This can be achieved through interactive activities, networking events, or simply providing ample space for mingling and socializing.
7. Provide education and skill-building workshops: Offer workshops or sessions that teach new skills or provide educational content relevant to the target audience. This can help non-civilian upper lower middle-income individuals gain knowledge, build confidence, and feel more included in the event.
8. Collaborate with local organizations
