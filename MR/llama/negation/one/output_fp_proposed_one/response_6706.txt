Individuals on non-independent temporary visas, such as work visas or student visas, may face challenges in engaging in community initiatives due to their immigration status. However, there are some successful community initiatives led by non-independent temporary visa holders that have made a positive impact in various fields:

1. Language Exchange Programs: Non-independent temporary visa holders can organize language exchange programs for their communities. This helps to promote cultural understanding and linguistic diversity, while also providing opportunities for language learning and practice.
2. Cultural Events: Temporary visa holders can organize cultural events, such as festivals, concerts, or art exhibitions, that showcase their home country's culture and traditions. These events can help to promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation among the local community.
3. Volunteer Work: Non-independent temporary visa holders can volunteer their time and skills for local organizations or charities. This can include working with children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities, among others.
4. Community Gardening: Temporary visa holders can initiate community gardening projects in their local areas. This not only promotes sustainability and environmental awareness but also provides an opportunity for social interaction and community building.
5. Education and Training: Non-independent temporary visa holders can offer educational workshops or training sessions on topics such as language, history, or cultural practices. These sessions can help to promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange of knowledge between the local community and international visitors.
6. Interfaith Dialogues: Temporary visa holders from different religious backgrounds can organize interfaith dialogues and discussions to promote mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation among people of different beliefs.
7. Environmental Conservation: Non-independent temporary visa holders can participate in local environmental conservation initiatives, such as beach cleanups or wildlife conservation projects. These activities not only benefit the local community but also provide an opportunity for international visitors to engage with the local environment and culture.
8. Community Outreach Programs: Temporary visa holders can establish outreach programs to connect with the local community, share their experiences and cultures
