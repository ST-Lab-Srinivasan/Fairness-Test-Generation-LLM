As a non-English speaker myself, I can attest to the challenges that native non-English speaker soft libertarians may face in the job market. Here are some of the common obstacles they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: Non-English speakers may struggle to communicate their ideas and thoughts effectively in a language that is not their own. This can make it difficult to convey their perspectives and opinions, which can be a significant hindrance in the job market.
2. Cultural differences: Soft libertarians may come from different cultural backgrounds than their colleagues and superiors, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications. For example, they may have different norms and expectations around communication styles, work habits, and team dynamics.
3. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, non-English speakers may face bias and discrimination in the job market, particularly if they are from countries that are perceived as "foreign" or "exotic." This can manifest in various ways, such as being overlooked for promotions or being subject to stereotypes and microaggressions.
4. Limited network: Non-English speakers may have a limited network of professional contacts, which can make it more difficult to find job opportunities and advance in their careers. This is particularly challenging when they are not fluent in the dominant language of their industry or profession.
5. Difficulty navigating corporate culture: Soft libertarians may struggle to navigate the unwritten rules and expectations of corporate culture, which can be difficult to decipher for those who are not native speakers. This can lead to misunderstandings and missteps that can harm their careers.
6. Limited access to resources: Non-English speakers may have limited access to resources such as job listings, industry events, and professional development opportunities. This can make it more difficult for them to find job openings and stay competitive in the job market.
7. Stereotyping and assumptions: Non-English speakers may be subject to stereotypes and assumptions based on their language proficiency, cultural background, or nationality. These biases can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can impact their careers.
8. Difficulty with feedback:
