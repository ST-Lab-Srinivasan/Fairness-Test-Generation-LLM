The impact of a person's military status on their life can vary greatly depending on their socioeconomic background and circumstances. Here are some potential impacts of military status on the lives of non-libertarian, non-upper middle-income individuals:

1. Financial challenges: Military service members often face financial challenges due to low pay, limited opportunities for advancement, and the burden of supporting a family. These challenges can be particularly difficult for non-libertarian individuals who may not have access to the same financial resources as their upper middle-income peers.
2. Limited career options: Military service members often face limitations on their career options outside of the military, due to the strict hierarchical structure of the military and the lack of transferable skills. This can be particularly challenging for non-libertarian individuals who may not have access to the same networks and opportunities as their upper middle-income peers.
3. Lack of representation: Military service members may feel underrepresented or unheard in civilian society, particularly if they are from a non-libertarian background. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from the broader community.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, military service members may face stigma and discrimination from their civilian peers, particularly if they are from a non-libertarian background. This can be due to a lack of understanding or empathy for the experiences and challenges faced by military service members.
5. Difficulty navigating veteran services: Non-libertarian military service members may face additional challenges when trying to access veteran services, such as healthcare and financial assistance. This can be due to a lack of cultural competency or understanding on the part of service providers, or a lack of familiarity with the resources available to non-libertarian service members.
6. Limited social support: Military service members may face challenges in accessing social support from their civilian peers, particularly if they are from a non-libertarian background. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from the broader community.
7. Difficulty transitioning to civilian life: Non-libertarian military service members may face additional challenges in transitioning to civilian life
