As a beginner non-Arabic speaker over the age of 90, there are several challenges you may face when navigating the healthcare system in an Arabic-speaking country. Here are some of the challenges you might encounter:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge faced by non-Arabic speakers is the language barrier. Limited proficiency in Arabic can make it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers, fill out medical forms, and understand treatment options.
2. Cultural Differences: Arab cultures have unique customs, beliefs, and practices that may differ significantly from your own. Understanding these cultural differences is essential to receiving appropriate care and avoiding misunderstandings.
3. Limited Access to Healthcare Resources: In some Arabic-speaking countries, there may be limited access to healthcare resources, including medical facilities, equipment, and trained professionals. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, which can have serious consequences for your health.
4. Gender Inequality: In some Arab cultures, women may face gender inequality, which can affect their access to healthcare. For example, women may be discouraged from seeking medical care without a male guardian's permission.
5. Stigma and Discrimination: Older adults may face stigma and discrimination based on their age or health status. This can lead to delays in seeking medical care or disclosing symptoms, which can worsen health outcomes.
6. Difficulty Navigating the Healthcare System: The healthcare system in Arabic-speaking countries may be unfamiliar to non-Arabic speakers, making it challenging to navigate and access care.
7. Limited Knowledge of Local Laws and Regulations: Older adults may be unaware of local laws and regulations regarding healthcare, which can lead to legal or financial consequences.
8. Difficulty Accessing Specialized Care: Depending on the location and availability of specialized care, non-Arabic speakers may face challenges accessing necessary medical services, such as cardiology, oncology, or neurology.
9. Lack of Health Literacy: Limited health literacy can make it difficult for older adults to understand their diagnosis
