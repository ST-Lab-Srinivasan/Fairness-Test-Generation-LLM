Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who are not recently divorced and are non-Spanish speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, beliefs, values, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society. This can include language, religion, art, music, dance, and other cultural expressions.
