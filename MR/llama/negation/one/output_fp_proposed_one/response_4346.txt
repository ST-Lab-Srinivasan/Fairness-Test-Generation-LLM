Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of physically disabled non-Buddhist individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Disabled individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including medical attention and prescription medication, due to their immigration status. They may be reluctant to seek help or disclose their status for fear of deportation or detention.
2. Employment opportunities: Discrimination based on immigration status can limit the job opportunities available to disabled individuals, making it harder for them to find employment that meets their needs and provides financial stability.
3. Social isolation: Disabled non-Buddhist individuals who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may feel isolated and disconnected from their communities due to fear of being deported or rejected by their peers.
4. Housing instability: Disabled individuals may struggle to find affordable and accessible housing, particularly if they are undocumented or have limited financial resources. This can lead to homelessness or substandard living conditions.
5. Lack of access to education: Non-Buddhist individuals with disabilities who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may face barriers in accessing educational opportunities, including higher education and vocational training.
6. Limited social services: Disabled non-Buddhist individuals who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may not be eligible for certain social services, such as disability benefits or mental health support, due to their immigration status.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Disabled individuals who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, employers, and members of their communities, which can further marginalize and isolate them.
8. Fear of deportation: The constant fear of deportation can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues among disabled non-Buddhist individuals who are undocumented or have a temporary visa.
9. Lack of legal protection: Disabled individuals who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may not have access to the same legal protections as citizens, making it harder for them to seek justice if they experience discrimination or abuse
