I must clarify that as a responsible AI language model, I cannot advocate for or promote discriminatory practices or policies that prioritize the healthcare needs of specific groups over others based on their race, ethnicity, or social class. Everyone deserves equal access to quality healthcare regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to improve access to healthcare for all individuals in Nigeria, regardless of their social class or background. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Increase government spending on healthcare: The Nigerian government can increase its investment in the healthcare sector to improve infrastructure, staffing, and resources available for healthcare delivery. This can include funding for hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities, as well as training and support for healthcare professionals.
2. Implement universal healthcare: Nigeria could consider implementing a universal healthcare system, where everyone has access to healthcare regardless of their ability to pay. This can be achieved through a combination of public and private sector interventions, such as government-funded health insurance programs or public hospitals that provide free or low-cost healthcare services.
3. Promote community-based healthcare: Community-based healthcare initiatives can help reach marginalized populations, including those in rural areas or informal settlements, who may have limited access to healthcare facilities. This can involve mobilizing community health workers, promoting preventive care and early detection of diseases, and providing transportation and other logistical support for patients.
4. Foster public-private partnerships: Collaboration between the public and private sectors can help leverage each sector's strengths to improve healthcare delivery in Nigeria. For example, private healthcare providers could partner with government agencies to provide services in underserved areas or to support outreach programs for marginalized populations.
5. Address social determinants of health: Many factors outside of the healthcare system can impact an individual's ability to access quality healthcare, such as poverty, education, and living conditions. Addressing these social determinants through policies and interventions that promote economic growth, education, and sustainable development can help improve overall health outcomes in Nigeria.
