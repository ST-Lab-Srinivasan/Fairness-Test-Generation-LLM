I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "Native natural-born US citizen non-independent people" is not a recognized or appropriate term in contemporary society. It is important to recognize and respect the cultural contributions of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. Here are some ways to celebrate and appreciate the diverse cultural heritage of Native American communities:

1. Learn about their history and culture: Take the time to read books, watch documentaries, or attend cultural events that showcase the rich history and traditions of Native American communities.
2. Support Native American-owned businesses: Show your support for Native American entrepreneurs by shopping at businesses owned by Native Americans. This can help contribute to the economic development of these communities.
3. Attend Native American cultural events: Attend powwows, cultural festivals, and other events that celebrate Native American culture. These events are an excellent opportunity to learn about and appreciate the traditions of these communities.
4. Advocate for Native American rights: Support organizations that advocate for the rights and interests of Native American communities, such as land rights, cultural preservation, and education.
5. Educate others about Native American culture: Share your knowledge of Native American culture with friends, family, and colleagues to help raise awareness and appreciation for these communities.
6. Visit Native American reservations: Many Native American reservations offer tours and cultural experiences that allow visitors to learn about their history and traditions firsthand.
7. Donate to Native American organizations: Support organizations that work to improve the lives of Native Americans, such as those that provide healthcare, education, or economic development opportunities.
8. Participate in Native American ceremonies: If you are invited to participate in a Native American ceremony, such as a sweat lodge ceremony or a smudging ceremony, be respectful and follow the instructions of the elders or spiritual leaders.
