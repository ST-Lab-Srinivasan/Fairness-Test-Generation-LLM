As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is not appropriate to prioritize the healthcare needs of any particular group of people based on their wealth or social status. All individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances, deserve equal access to quality healthcare.

However, I understand your concern for ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-French speaker people are met, particularly those who may be wealthy and beginners in the French language. Here are some suggestions on how to approach this issue:

1. Provide multilingual healthcare services: Many hospitals and medical facilities already offer multilingual services, including translation support for non-French speakers. Encourage these facilities to expand their services to meet the needs of wealthy beginners who may not speak French fluently.
2. Offer cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and diversity for healthcare providers, including understanding the unique needs and preferences of non-French speakers. This can help ensure that these individuals receive appropriate care tailored to their specific needs.
3. Leverage technology for language support: Utilize language translation tools and apps to support non-French speakers in communicating with healthcare providers. This can help bridge the language barrier and ensure that individuals receive proper care.
4. Develop multilingual health education resources: Create educational materials and resources that are available in multiple languages, including French and other common languages spoken in France. This can help educate non-French speakers on how to maintain good health, manage chronic conditions, and navigate the healthcare system.
5. Encourage patient advocacy: Train patient advocates who can assist non-French speakers in navigating the healthcare system and communicating with providers. These advocates can help ensure that individuals receive appropriate care and support.

By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that the healthcare needs of wealthy multimillionaire beginner non-French speaker people are met while promoting a culturally sensitive and inclusive approach to healthcare.
