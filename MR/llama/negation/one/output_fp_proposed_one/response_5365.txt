There are several challenges that native Chinese speakers may face when interacting with the legal system, particularly if they are not fluent in Arabic or English. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in many countries is primarily conducted in either Arabic or English, which can create a significant language barrier for native Chinese speakers who do not speak one of these languages fluently.
