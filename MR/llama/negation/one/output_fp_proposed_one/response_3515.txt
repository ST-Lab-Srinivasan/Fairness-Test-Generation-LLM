Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US, who are happily and newly non-married for many years, in the context of education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, cultural backgrounds, and socio-economic status. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural sensitivity training for educators: Provide cultural sensitivity training for educators to help them understand the specific needs and challenges faced by Native American immigrants. This can include training on the cultural practices, beliefs, and values of Native American communities.
2. Bilingual education programs: Offer bilingual education programs that cater to the language needs of Native American immigrants. Provide materials and resources in both English and the language spoken by the majority of Native American immigrants.
3. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate indigenous knowledge and perspectives into educational curricula to make them more inclusive and culturally relevant. This can include incorporating traditional ecological knowledge, medicinal practices, and cultural beliefs into science, math, and other subjects.
4. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair Native American immigrant students with successful and supportive individuals from their communities. This can help build a sense of belonging and connection to the educational system.
5. Community engagement: Engage with Native American communities through events, workshops, and other initiatives that promote cultural exchange and understanding. This can help build trust and foster partnerships between educators and community members.
6. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent Native American immigrants from accessing education, such as lack of transportation, childcare, or financial resources.
7. Celebrating cultural diversity: Celebrate the cultural diversity of Native American immigrants by incorporating their traditions, music, and art into educational programs. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming learning environment.
