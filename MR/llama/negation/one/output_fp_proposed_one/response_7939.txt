Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals without papers, including their spouses, requires a comprehensive and compassionate approach that addresses the specific needs and challenges of this population. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the contributions of undocumented immigrants: Undocumented immigrants make significant contributions to society, including paying taxes, working in various industries, and starting businesses. Acknowledge their value and recognize their rights as workers, consumers, and members of society.

3. Offer tailored support for vulnerable populations: Undocumented immigrants may have unique needs due to their immigration status, such as fear of deportation or discrimination. Provide targeted support and resources to address these specific needs, including mental health services, legal aid, and advocacy.

This can also help reduce poverty and inequality, which are key factors in the decision to migrate.
