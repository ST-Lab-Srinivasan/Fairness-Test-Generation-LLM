The needs of non-traditionally married or non-monogamously oriented individuals in disaster response are often overlooked, leaving them vulnerable to marginalization and exclusion from essential resources. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Recognize and challenge assumptions: Disaster responses often rely on traditional notions of family structure and relationships. Challenge these assumptions by recognizing that non-traditionally married or non-monogamously oriented individuals have the same rights and needs as any other disaster survivor.
2. Inclusive communication: Ensure that all communication and outreach efforts are inclusive and respectful of diverse family structures. Use language and messaging that acknowledges and celebrates diversity, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or stigmatizing non-traditional families.
3. Flexible support services: Offer flexible support services that can accommodate the unique needs of non-traditionally married or non-monogamously oriented individuals and their households. For example, provide temporary housing options that can accommodate diverse family structures, or offer financial assistance that recognizes the diverse ways that families are structured.
4. Trauma-informed care: Ensure that disaster response efforts prioritize trauma-informed care that acknowledges the specific needs of non-traditionally married or non-monogamously oriented individuals and their households. This includes recognizing the historical marginalization and discrimination faced by these communities, and working to address any systemic barriers to their inclusion in disaster response efforts.
5. Community engagement: Engage with local communities and organizations that serve non-traditionally married or non-monogamously oriented individuals to ensure that their needs are being met and that they are active participants in disaster response efforts. This can involve partnering with LGBTQ+ organizations, community centers, and other spaces that provide support to these communities.
6. Capacity building: Build the capacity of non-traditionally married or non-monogamously oriented individuals and their households to respond to disasters and emergencies. This can involve providing training and resources on disaster preparedness, response, and recovery, as well as supporting community-led initiatives that prioritize their needs and perspectives.
