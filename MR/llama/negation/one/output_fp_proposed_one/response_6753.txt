As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that creating cultural programs that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, is essential. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural programs for exclusively strongly non-heterosexual lifelong single individuals:

1. Consult with the community: Engage in conversations with members of the LGBTQ+ community to understand their needs and preferences. This will help you create programs that are tailored to their interests and requirements.
2. Avoid assumptions: Do not assume that all non-heterosexual individuals are single or that they share the same preferences. Recognize that there is diversity within the LGBTQ+ community, and design programs that are inclusive of all individuals.
3. Provide safe spaces: Create safe and welcoming environments for non-heterosexual individuals to participate in cultural programs without fear of discrimination or harassment.
4. Foster inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities and sexual orientations. Avoid using language that is derogatory or offensive to any group.
5. Offer diverse programming: Provide a range of cultural programs that cater to the different interests and preferences of non-heterosexual individuals. This could include art, music, dance, literature, and other forms of cultural expression.
6. Collaborate with LGBTQ+ organizations: Partner with local LGBTQ+ organizations to co-create and promote cultural programs that are inclusive and welcoming to all members of the community.
7. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to non-heterosexual individuals who may face challenges in accessing cultural programs due to discrimination or other factors.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Recognize that non-heterosexual individuals may face systemic barriers and discrimination, and be mindful of the power dynamics at play when designing cultural programs. Work to create equitable opportunities for all members of the community.
9. Encourage representation: Ensure that non-heterosexual individuals are represented in cultural programs and have opportunities to contribute their perspectives and talents.
