Creating more inclusive cultural programs for partly non-asexual recently single individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target group: Conduct research to better understand the needs, preferences, and values of this group. This could involve surveys, focus groups, or interviews to gather insights into their cultural interests, hobbies, and social habits.
2. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of cultural programs that cater to different interests and preferences. For instance, offer events that promote intellectual discussions, creative expression, socializing, or relaxation. This could include book clubs, art classes, dance workshops, or meditation sessions.
3. Ensure accessibility: Make sure the programs are accessible to all, regardless of their abilities or mobility. Offer virtual events or activities that can be participated in from home, and provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives, and foster a culture of inclusivity and respect.
5. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities, sexual orientations, and relationship statuses. Avoid using terms that are offensive or alienating to any group.
6. Collaborate with community partners: Partner with local organizations that serve the LGBTQ+ and singles communities. This can help amplify your reach and provide additional resources and support.
7. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adjust your programs based on feedback and participation. Encourage participants to share their thoughts and ideas, and make changes as needed to ensure everyone feels included and engaged.
8. Provide safe spaces: Create environments where participants can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could involve providing gender-neutral facilities or creating separate spaces for different identity groups.
9. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair experienced individuals with those who are newer to the community, providing guidance and support as they navigate their cultural identity and social relationships.
10. Celebrate diversity: Highlight the unique contributions and perspectives
