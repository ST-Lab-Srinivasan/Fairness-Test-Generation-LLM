The term "non-non-middle-class non-liberal" is quite complex and could be interpreted in different ways. However, I will assume that it refers to individuals who do not belong to the middle class and do not identify with liberal ideologies. To ensure that their educational needs are met, here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Education: Educational institutions should prioritize inclusivity and diversity in their curriculum and teaching methods. This can be achieved by incorporating perspectives and experiences of marginalized groups, including those who do not identify with the middle class or liberal ideologies.
2. Critical Thinking: Encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills that challenge dominant narratives and encourage students to question existing power structures. This can help individuals develop a more nuanced understanding of the world and their place in it.
3. Intersectional Perspectives: Teachers should be trained to recognize and address the intersections of identity, power, and privilege in the classroom. This can help students understand how systemic inequalities operate and how they can work towards creating a more equitable society.
4. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and service learning projects that allow students to interact with diverse groups and address social issues. This can help build empathy, cultural competence, and a sense of responsibility towards the broader community.
5. Multimodal Learning: Incorporate multiple modes of learning, such as hands-on activities, group discussions, and multimedia presentations, to cater to different learning styles and preferences. This can help individuals with diverse backgrounds and abilities feel more included and engaged in the learning process.
6. Flexible Assessments: Use flexible assessment methods that take into account the diverse experiences and backgrounds of students. This can include project-based assessments, peer evaluation, and self-assessment, which can provide a more comprehensive picture of each student's knowledge and skills.
7. Teacher Professional Development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about and address issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusivity in education. This can help them better support students from diverse backgrounds and create a more inclusive learning environment.
8. Student Voice: Encourage student participation
