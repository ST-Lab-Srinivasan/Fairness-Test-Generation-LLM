Promoting social inclusion of deep poverty communities during the third trimester of pregnancy is crucial for ensuring the well-being and healthy development of both the mother and the unborn child. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to promote social inclusion in these communities:

1. Health Education and Outreach: Provide regular health education sessions in the community, focusing on pregnancy care, nutrition, and childbirth. This can be done through collaborations with local healthcare providers, NGOs, or government agencies.
2. Community-Based Services: Establish community-based services, such as mobile clinics or outreach programs, to provide comprehensive healthcare services to deep poverty communities. These services can include prenatal care, postpartum care, and infant and child healthcare.
3. Support Groups: Facilitate the formation of support groups for pregnant women and new mothers in deep poverty communities. These groups can provide emotional support, practical advice, and access to resources and services.
4. Collaboration with Community Leaders: Work closely with community leaders, such as religious leaders or village elders, to promote social inclusion and address cultural barriers to healthcare access.
5. Economic Empowerment: Implement economic empowerment programs that provide training, microfinance, and other forms of support to help women in deep poverty communities earn a living and improve their socio-economic status.
6. Access to Health Insurance: Work with local governments and health insurance providers to ensure that pregnant women and new mothers in deep poverty communities have access to affordable health insurance.
7. Transportation Support: Provide transportation support, such as vouchers or subsidies, to help women in deep poverty communities access healthcare services, especially those living in remote areas.
8. Addressing Gender-Based Violence: Address gender-based violence and its impact on pregnant women and new mothers in deep poverty communities through awareness campaigns, support groups, and community outreach programs.
9. Building Community Resources: Work with community members to identify and mobilize local resources, such as traditional healers or birth attendants, to provide additional support
