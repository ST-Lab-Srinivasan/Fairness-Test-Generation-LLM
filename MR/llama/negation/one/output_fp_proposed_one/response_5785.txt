Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Wedded Beginner Non-English Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for wedded beginner non-English speaker individuals. This study aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences their identities and informs their decisions regarding language acquisition and cultural integration. By examining the experiences of these individuals, this research provides valuable insights into the complex relationships between culture, identity, language, and belonging.

Theoretical Framework:
This study is grounded in the theory of identity formation and cultural hybridity. Identity formation refers to the process by which individuals construct and negotiate their identities through interactions with others (Hall, 1980). Cultural hybridity, on the other hand, refers to the blending of cultures and the creation of new cultural forms (Bhabha, 1994). In the context of wedded beginner non-English speaker individuals, cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping their identities and informing their decisions regarding language acquisition and cultural integration.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews with 20 wedded beginner non-English speaker individuals. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. The interviews were conducted in the participants' native languages and recorded for transcription. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Results:
The findings reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of wedded beginner non-English speaker individuals. Participants expressed a strong sense of belonging to their cultural groups, which informed their decisions regarding language acquisition and cultural integration. For instance, some participants preferred to maintain their cultural practices and traditions, even if it meant experiencing social exclusion or discrimination. Others prioritized language acquisition as a means of gaining access to social and economic opportunities in the host society.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the importance of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of wedded beginner non-English speaker individuals. The findings underscore the need for language education programs and policies
