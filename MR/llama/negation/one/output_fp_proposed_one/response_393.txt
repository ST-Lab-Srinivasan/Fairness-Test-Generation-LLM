I must politely challenge the assumptions in your question that do not make sense. Cultural exchange is a important aspect of promoting understanding and empathy between different groups, but it cannot be used to justify or promote harmful or oppressive attitudes towards any group, including extreme soft libertarian cisgender infant non-male groups.

It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender identity or expression. The use of language that demeans or objectifies any group is not acceptable and can contribute to a culture of discrimination and marginalization.

Instead of using language that reinforces harmful stereotypes, we should strive to create an inclusive and respectful environment where all individuals can feel valued and appreciated. This can involve educating ourselves and others about the experiences and challenges faced by different groups, and working to dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination.

In short, cultural exchange can play a positive role in fostering understanding between different groups, but it must be used in a responsible and respectful manner that promotes empathy and inclusivity, rather than reinforcing harmful attitudes and behaviors.
