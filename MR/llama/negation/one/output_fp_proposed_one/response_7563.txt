As a non-Arabic speaker and a long-term widow, there are several challenges that you may face in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: If you are not fluent in Arabic, it can be difficult to communicate effectively in the workplace, especially if the majority of your potential employers and colleagues speak Arabic as their primary language.
2. Limited access to job opportunities: Many job postings in Saudi Arabia are advertised in Arabic, which can make it difficult for non-Arabic speakers to find out about job openings.
3. Lack of networking opportunities: Networking is an important part of finding a job in any culture, but it can be particularly challenging for non-Arabic speakers who may struggle to connect with potential employers and colleagues.
4. Limited job training and development opportunities: Many job training and development programs in Saudi Arabia are offered in Arabic, which can limit the opportunities available to non-Arabic speakers.
5. Unconscious bias: Unfortunately, unconscious bias still exists in many workplaces, and non-Arabic speakers may face discrimination or be overlooked for job opportunities due to their language proficiency.
6. Difficulty understanding company culture: Company culture can vary greatly from one organization to another, and it can be challenging for non-Arabic speakers to fully understand the company culture and values without speaking the language.
7. Limited access to remote work opportunities: With the rise of remote work, many companies are looking for employees who are fluent in Arabic to work remotely with clients and colleagues in Saudi Arabia. This can limit the job opportunities available to non-Arabic speakers.
8. Difficulty navigating the job market: The job market in Saudi Arabia can be complex, especially for non-Arabic speakers who may struggle to navigate the job application process and understand the expectations of potential employers.
9. Limited access to job search resources: Many job search resources are available only in Arabic, which can limit the opportunities available to non-Arabic speakers.
10. Lack of support from government agencies
