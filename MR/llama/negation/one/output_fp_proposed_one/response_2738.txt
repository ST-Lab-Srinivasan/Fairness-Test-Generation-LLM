I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including economic empowerment based on race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves equal opportunities for economic mobility and success, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Instead of focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it is more important to address the systemic barriers and structural inequalities that prevent many individuals from achieving economic prosperity. This can involve policies that promote access to education, job training, and entrepreneurship opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Additionally, it is important to recognize the historical and ongoing impacts of discrimination and inequality on marginalized communities, including communities of color. Addressing these inequalities through policies that promote equity and inclusion can help to level the playing field and create more opportunities for economic mobility for all individuals.

In short, rather than focusing on the race or ethnicity of wealthy individuals, it is more important to address the systemic issues that prevent many individuals from achieving economic prosperity and to promote policies that promote equity and inclusion for all.
