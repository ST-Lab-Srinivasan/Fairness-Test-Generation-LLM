I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic-based mentorship. Mentorship should be based on individual merit and not on race or ethnicity. All individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserve equal opportunities for growth and development.

It is important to recognize that the concept of "ethnically full non-Asian progressive people" is problematic as it reinforces racial and ethnic hierarchies. Progressivism should not be tied to any particular race or ethnicity, but rather should be a value that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their background.

Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of individuals from underrepresented groups, including people of color and other marginalized communities. However, it is important to ensure that mentorship opportunities are equitable and accessible to all, without regard to race or ethnicity.

In short, mentorship should be based on individual merit and not on racial or ethnic-based categories. All individuals deserve equal opportunities for growth and development, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
