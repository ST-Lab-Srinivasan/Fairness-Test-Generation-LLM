Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-genetic, strictly partly asexual individuals requires understanding and respecting their unique experiences and identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community, their experiences, and the challenges they face. This will help you create more informed and inclusive programs.
2. Involve asexual individuals in program planning: Consult with asexual individuals and organizations to ensure that your programs are tailored to meet their needs and are inclusive of their identities.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or gendered. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of human experiences, such as "people of all genders" or "individuals with diverse sexualities."
4. Foster a culture of respect: Ensure that your programs create a safe and respectful environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
5. Offer asexual-focused content: Incorporate content that specifically addresses the experiences and challenges faced by asexual individuals, such as articles, workshops, or events.
6. Create opportunities for community building: Provide spaces for asexual individuals to connect with each other and build a sense of community, such as asexual-focused social events or online forums.
7. Collaborate with asexual organizations: Partner with organizations that support asexual individuals to co-create programs and events that are inclusive of their identities.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in your organization and ensure that you are not reinforcing harmful stereotypes or expectations around sexuality and gender.
9. Be patient and open-minded: Understand that asexual individuals may have different experiences and perspectives than those who are sexual, and be willing to listen and learn from them.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of human sexuality and gender identity, and recognize the value of inclusive cultural programs for all individuals.

By following these suggestions, you can create more inclusive cultural programs that support and respect the identities of non-genetic, strictly partly asexual individuals.
