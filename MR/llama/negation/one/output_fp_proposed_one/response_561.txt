Supporting the social inclusion of deep in poverty, ultra-non-conservative individuals can be a complex and multifaceted task. Here are some potential strategies that could be effective:

1. Education and job training programs: Providing access to education and job training programs can help individuals acquire new skills and knowledge, which can increase their earning potential and improve their social status. This can also help reduce poverty and inequality.
