Cultural competence is a critical aspect of healthcare, particularly for beginner Arabic speakers who are native natural-born US non-citizens. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they can better understand the beliefs, values, and practices of their Arabic-speaking patients. This can lead to higher patient satisfaction and trust, which is essential for effective healthcare delivery.
2. Accurate diagnosis and treatment: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers recognize the cultural nuances that can influence a patient's presentation and behavior.
