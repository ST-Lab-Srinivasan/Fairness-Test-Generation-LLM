Creating more inclusive housing policies for pregnant women, particularly those in their third trimester who are no longer single, requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accommodate unique needs: Pregnant women have specific needs during the third trimester, such as more frequent urination, back pain, and difficulty sleeping. Housing policies should accommodate these needs by providing accessible bathrooms, comfortable bedding, and quiet spaces for rest.
