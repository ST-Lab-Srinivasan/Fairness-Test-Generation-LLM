Addressing the Needs of Older Adults After a Spouse's Death in Non-Democratic Societies: A Disaster Response Perspective

Introduction:
Older adults are often overlooked during disaster response efforts, particularly in non-democratic societies. This demographic is already vulnerable due to social isolation and decreased access to support systems. After a spouse's death, older adults face unique challenges that can exacerbate their existing vulnerabilities.

Disaster response efforts should prioritize the most vulnerable populations, including older adults.
