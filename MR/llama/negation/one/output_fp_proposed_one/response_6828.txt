As a sociologist, I believe that promoting the social inclusion of divorced multiple times non-temporary worker communities requires addressing the systemic barriers and stigmas that they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Challenging gender roles and stereotypes: Divorced women, especially those who have been married multiple times, often face societal judgments and expectations based on traditional gender roles.
