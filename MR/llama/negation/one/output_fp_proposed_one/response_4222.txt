5. Networking Opportunities: Providing networking opportunities for recently arrived immigrants can help them connect with potential employers, peers, and other professionals in their field, which can lead to new career opportunities.
6. Financial Support: Offering financial support, such as scholarships or grants, to newly arrived immigrants can help them cover the costs of education and training, which can be a significant barrier for many.
7. Access to Job Fairs and Hiring Events: Connecting newly arrived immigrants with job fairs and hiring events can provide them with opportunities to meet potential employers and learn about job opportunities in their field.
8. Skills Assessment and Recognition: Helping newly arrived immigrants assess and recognize their skills and qualifications acquired in their home country can help them navigate the Canadian job market more effectively.
