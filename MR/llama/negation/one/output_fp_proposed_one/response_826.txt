Creating more inclusive social policies for long-time married non-permeant resident individuals is essential to ensure that these individuals are not left behind in the social welfare system. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Address the gaps in existing policies: Review existing social policies and identify any gaps or biases that may affect long-time married non-permanent residents.

Provide them with access to social services and benefits on a par with permanent residents.
3. Offer flexible support structures: Design social policies that are flexible and adaptable to the changing needs of long-time married non-permanent residents. For example, provide age-related benefits that can be accessed at different stages of life, such as retirement or illness.
4. Encourage community involvement: Engage with local communities to build support networks for long-time married non-permanent residents. This could involve organizing social events, providing access to community facilities, and promoting intergenerational connections.
5. Advocate for their rights: Advocate for the rights of long-time married non-permanent residents by raising awareness about their situation and lobbying for policy changes at local and national levels. This could involve collaborating with advocacy groups, community organizations, and government agencies.
6. Provide access to education and training: Offer educational and training opportunities to long-time married non-permanent residents to help them acquire new skills and knowledge that can enhance their social inclusion. This could include language classes, digital literacy programs, or vocational training.
7. Promote cultural exchange: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together permanent and non-permanent residents to promote mutual understanding and respect. This could involve sharing cultural practices, traditions, and values, as well as learning about each other's perspectives and experiences.
8. Address healthcare disparities: Ensure that long-time married non-permanent residents have equal access
