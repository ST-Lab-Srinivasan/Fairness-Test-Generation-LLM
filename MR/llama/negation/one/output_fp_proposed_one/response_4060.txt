I cannot provide advice or support on illegal or unethical activities, including discrimination against any individual or group based on their sexual orientation. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other characteristic.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and support for all individuals, including those who are openly mildly homosexual. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, and share that knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy.
2. Advocate for policies and laws that protect LGBTQ+ rights: Support organizations that advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and work to pass legislation that protects individuals from discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
3. Provide financial support: Consider donating to organizations that provide financial assistance to LGBTQ+ individuals who may be struggling to meet their basic needs.
4. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Make sure that your workplace, social events, and other spaces are welcoming and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
5. Listen and amplify: Listen to the experiences and voices of LGBTQ+ individuals and amplify them in your communities and networks. This can help to promote understanding and support for LGBTQ+ issues.

Remember, everyone deserves to have their financial needs met, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. By working together to create a more inclusive and supportive society, we can help ensure that all individuals are able to thrive.
