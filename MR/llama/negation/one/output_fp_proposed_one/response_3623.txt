As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Creating inclusive cultural programs for any group of people requires careful consideration and sensitivity towards their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural programs for strong atheist natural-born Canadian non-citizen individuals:

1. Engage in active listening: Start by engaging in open and respectful dialogue with the community you aim to serve. Listen to their experiences, concerns, and ideas for inclusive programming. This will help you understand their needs and preferences better.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that your cultural programs reflect the diversity of the communities you serve. This can be achieved by incorporating different viewpoints, experiences, and art forms into your programs. For example, include indigenous art, music, and storytelling in your cultural events to honor the rich cultural heritage of Canada's first peoples.
3. Provide accessible programming: Make sure that your cultural programs are accessible to all, regardless of their abilities or socio-economic background. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials for individuals with disabilities.
4. Promote intersectionality: Recognize that individuals have multiple identities and experiences. Be mindful of the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, religion, and other factors that may impact their experience of cultural programs. Ensure that your programs are inclusive of all these intersecting identities.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected. Encourage dialogue and interaction between participants, and provide opportunities for individuals to connect with each other based on shared interests or experiences.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that have marginalized certain groups. Be intentional about redistributing power and creating spaces where underrepresented voices can be heard.
7. Offer programming outside of traditional hours: Consider offering cultural programs during non-traditional hours to accommodate individuals who may have scheduling constraints due to work or family obligations.
