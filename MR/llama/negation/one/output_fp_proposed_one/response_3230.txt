Ensuring the educational needs of native non-English speaker very old (90s+) students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Assess their language proficiency: Conduct a language assessment to determine the student's level of English proficiency and identify any areas where they may need additional support.

3. Provide multilingual materials: Make available educational materials in the student's native language or provide translated materials to help them better understand the content.
4. Use technology: Utilize technology, such as audio books, video conferencing, and online resources, to support their learning and make it more accessible.
5. Provide one-on-one support: Offer one-on-one tutoring or small group instruction to ensure that the student's individual needs are met.
6. Foster a supportive environment: Create an inclusive and supportive learning environment that acknowledges and values the diversity of the students, including their cultural backgrounds and language proficiency.
7. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve older adults to provide educational resources and support.
8. Offer flexible scheduling: Accommodate the needs of older students by offering flexible scheduling options, such as daytime or evening classes, to accommodate their schedules and mobility issues.
9. Provide social opportunities: In addition to academic instruction, provide opportunities for social interaction and community building to help students feel connected and engaged.
10. Monitor progress regularly: Regularly assess the student's progress and adjust teaching strategies as needed to ensure that their educational needs are being met.
