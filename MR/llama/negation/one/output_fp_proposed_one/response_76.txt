Creating more inclusive social policies for blue-collar ex-spouse individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this group. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognize the contributions of blue-collar workers: Blue-collar workers are often overlooked in social policies, but they play a crucial role in keeping the economy running. Recognizing their contributions and valuing their work can help create more inclusive policies that benefit them directly.
