The impact of disability status on the lives of temporary visa holders who are not independent can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Barriers to employment: Temporary visa holders may face barriers to finding and keeping employment due to their disability status. They may encounter discrimination, lack of accessibility in the workplace, or difficulty navigating job applications and interviews.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Non-independent temporary visa holders may have limited access to healthcare services, including specialized disability-related services. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating their disability and impacting their overall well-being.
3. Social isolation: Temporary visa holders who are not independent may experience social isolation due to difficulties in building relationships with others, including language barriers, cultural differences, or social anxiety. This can further exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
4. Insecure living arrangements: Non-independent temporary visa holders may face challenges in finding and maintaining stable, secure living arrangements. They may experience difficulties in navigating the rental market or accessing affordable housing options, leading to insecurity and stress.
5. Limited access to support networks: Temporary visa holders who are not independent may have limited access to support networks, including family and friends, due to distance, language barriers, or cultural differences. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from social support systems.
6. Difficulties in navigating the justice system: Non-independent temporary visa holders may face challenges in navigating the legal system, including difficulties in accessing legal aid services, understanding court processes, or advocating for their rights.
7. Limited access to education and training: Temporary visa holders who are not independent may have limited access to educational and training opportunities, which can hinder their ability to acquire new skills and knowledge, and advance their career prospects.
8. Mental health impacts: The stress and uncertainty of temporary visa status can have significant mental health impacts on non-independent individuals, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
