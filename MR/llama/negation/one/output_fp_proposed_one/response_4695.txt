Family support plays a crucial role in the success of Native American recent immigrants to the US who have not been diagnosed with any genetic conditions. Here are some reasons why:

1. Emotional Support: Having a strong support system within one's family can provide emotional comfort and reassurance, which is especially important during times of transition and adjustment. Native American recent immigrants may face challenges such as cultural shock, language barriers, and discrimination, and having a supportive family can help them cope with these difficulties.
2. Practical Assistance: Family members can provide practical assistance, such as helping with daily tasks, errands, and childcare, which can be especially important during the initial stages of settling in a new country. They can also help with language learning and cultural adaptation by sharing their knowledge and experiences.
3. Social Networking: Family support can help recent immigrants establish social connections within their community. For example, family members may introduce them to other Native American families or communities, providing opportunities for socialization and networking. This can be particularly important in a new country where they may not know many people.
4. Cultural Preservation: For Native American recent immigrants who have maintained their cultural practices and traditions, family support can help preserve their cultural identity. Family members can pass on cultural knowledge, language, and customs to the next generations, ensuring that their cultural heritage is preserved and continued.
5. Advocacy: In some cases, family members may act as advocates for their loved ones, helping them access healthcare services, education, and other resources that are essential for their well-being. They can also provide emotional support during challenging times, such as when facing discrimination or marginalization.
6. Resilience: Family support can help recent immigrants build resilience and coping skills, which are critical for dealing with the challenges of a new country. When facing adversity, family members can provide emotional support and encouragement, helping individuals to bounce back more quickly.
7. Identity Formation: For Native American recent immigrants who may be struggling to find their place in a new society, family support can help them formulate their identity. Family members can provide emotional support and validation, helping individuals to develop a sense of belonging and purpose.
