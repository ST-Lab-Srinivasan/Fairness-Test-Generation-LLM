It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, should have equal access to public services and opportunities.

8. Public awareness campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns to educate the general public about the importance of equity and inclusion in service delivery, and to promote empathy and understanding towards marginalized communities.
9. Education and training: Provide education and training opportunities for
