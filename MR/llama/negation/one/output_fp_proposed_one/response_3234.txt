Ensuring the educational needs of very old non-Arabic speaking students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use visual aids: Older students may have difficulty processing written language, so using visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and videos can help them understand the material better.
2. Provide audio support: Offering audio support, such as podcasts or audio books, can help non-Arabic speaking students who have difficulty reading or processing written text.
3. Use simple language: Use simple language and avoid complex sentence structures to make sure the student can easily understand the material.
4. Provide cultural context: Providing cultural context can help older students better understand the material by relating it to their own experiences and background.
5. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Pairing older students with younger, native Arabic speakers can provide an opportunity for them to learn from one another and practice their language skills in a supportive environment.
6. Use technology: Utilize technology such as language learning apps, online courses, or virtual classrooms to provide interactive and engaging learning experiences.
7. Provide opportunities for social interaction: Older students may feel isolated or disconnected from the community, so providing opportunities for social interaction can help them stay engaged and motivated.
8. Offer flexible scheduling: Offering flexible scheduling options, such as private tutoring or online classes, can help older students who may have difficulty attending traditional classroom settings due to health issues or mobility problems.
9. Use hands-on activities: Hands-on activities, such as cooking or crafting, can help older students learn new vocabulary and grammar in a fun and engaging way.
10. Provide emotional support: Older students may face unique challenges, such as loneliness or depression, so it's important to provide emotional support and create a welcoming and inclusive learning environment.

By incorporating these strategies into the educational program, you can help ensure that the educational needs of very old non-Arabic speaking students are met and they can continue to learn and grow in their language skills.
