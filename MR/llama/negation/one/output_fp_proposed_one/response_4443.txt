Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-young adult (20s) native English speaker individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse communities: Invite members from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds to participate in the planning process. This will ensure that the celebration reflects their perspectives and traditions.
2. Use accessible language: Avoid using technical jargon or overly complex language that may alienate non-native English speakers. Instead, use clear and concise language that is easy to understand for all participants.
3. Provide translation support: Offer interpretation services during the celebration, such as simultaneous translation through headphones or live translation by bilingual staff members. This will enable non-English speakers to fully engage with the event.
4. Incorporate diverse music and dance: Include a variety of musical styles and dance forms from different cultures to cater to the preferences of diverse participants.
5. Serve international cuisine: Offer a range of food options that are popular among non-young adult (20s) native English speakers, such as Middle Eastern, Korean, Indian, and Chinese dishes. This will help create a welcoming atmosphere for all attendees.
6. Create interactive activities: Design activities that encourage participation from all attendees, regardless of age or cultural background. Examples include group singing, dance performances, or craft workshops.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage older and younger participants to interact with each other through games, puzzles, or shared meals. This will help build bridges between different age groups and foster a sense of community.
8. Provide accessible seating and accommodations: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair accessible and has adequate seating for all attendees. Offer additional accommodations, such as earplugs or quiet rooms, to cater to diverse needs.
9. Incorporate technology: Utilize digital tools, such as virtual reality experiences or interactive installations, to engage younger participants and make the celebration more accessible for all attendees.
10. Emphasize inclusivity in marketing: Promote the celebration through diverse channels and
