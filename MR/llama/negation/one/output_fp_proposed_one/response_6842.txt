Ensuring that the voices of native non-Spanish speaker immigrant recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide language interpretation and translation services at public meetings, hearings, and other decision-making forums. This will enable immigrants who may not speak Spanish to participate fully in the process.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training for decision-makers and staff to better understand the experiences and perspectives of immigrant communities. This can help reduce biases and improve the quality of decision-making.
3. Community Outreach and Engagement: Develop and implement a comprehensive community outreach and engagement strategy that targets immigrant populations. This can include door-to-door canvassing, flyers in multiple languages, and culturally appropriate messaging.
4. Partnerships with Immigrant Organizations: Build partnerships with organizations that serve immigrant communities to leverage their expertise and networks. These partnerships can help amplify the voices of immigrants and ensure that their perspectives are represented in decision-making processes.
5. Advocacy and Education: Advocate for policies and programs that promote the inclusion of immigrant voices in decision-making processes. This can include educating immigrant communities about their rights and how to participate in decision-making forums.
6. Use of Technology: Utilize technology to facilitate remote participation in decision-making processes, such as online surveys, focus groups, and virtual town hall meetings. This can help ensure that immigrants who face barriers to in-person participation are still able to contribute their perspectives.
7. Capacity Building: Provide training and resources to immigrant communities to build their capacity to participate in decision-making processes. This can include leadership development programs, advocacy training, and legal clinics.
8. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote the inclusion of immigrant voices in decision-making processes. For example, implementing a "no wrong door" policy that ensures that immigrants are directed to the most appropriate agency or program for their needs.
