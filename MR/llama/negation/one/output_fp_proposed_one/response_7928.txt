Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and integration of culturally non-Hindu Native recent immigrants to the US. Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and cultural brokerage, helping these individuals navigate their new environment and culture. Here are some ways mentorship can impact the development of culturally non-Hindu Native recent immigrants:

1. Cultural adaptation: Non-Hindu Native immigrants may face challenges adapting to a new cultural context, particularly if they come from a different cultural background. A mentor who is familiar with both the immigrant's culture and the US culture can help bridge these differences and facilitate communication and understanding.
