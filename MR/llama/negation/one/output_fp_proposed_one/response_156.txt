Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent beginner Spanish speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpreters or translation services in public spaces, such as courts, hospitals, and city hall. This can help individuals who may not speak Spanish fluently navigate these institutions more easily.
2. Create multilingual signage: Use a variety of languages on signs and displays throughout public spaces to reach a wider audience. This can include the language(s) spoken by the local community, as well as common languages such as English.
3. Offer cultural sensitivity training for employees: Provide training for employees who interact with the public to understand the cultural norms and practices of diverse communities. This can help ensure that individuals are treated with respect and dignity.
4. Incorporate visual aids: Use pictures, diagrams, or other visual aids to communicate information in public spaces, especially for individuals who may not speak Spanish fluently.
5. Provide accessible technology: Ensure that technology such as electronic displays, kiosks, and other interactive devices are accessible to individuals with disabilities and non-Spanish speakers. This can include providing audio or visual descriptions of information, or using simple language that is easy to understand.
6. Foster a sense of community: Create public spaces that foster a sense of community and inclusivity. This can involve hosting events or activities that bring people together and promote understanding and respect for diverse cultures.
7. Engage with the local community: Work with local community organizations, schools, and other stakeholders to ensure that public spaces are inclusive and meet the needs of non-independent beginner Spanish speaker individuals.
8. Provide language resources: Offer language learning resources such as books, DVDs, or online tools in public libraries or other accessible locations. This can help individuals learn Spanish and improve their communication skills.
9. Incorporate cultural elements: Incorporate cultural elements such as music, art, or food from diverse communities into public spaces to create a more inclusive environment.
10. Monitor and evaluate progress: Regularly monitor and evaluate the accessibility and inclusivity of public spaces to identify areas for improvement. This can involve collecting feedback from individuals and making adjustments based on their needs
