Creating more inclusive cultural programs for recently widowed non-disabled individuals requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies to help make cultural programs more accessible and welcoming:

1. Consult with the community: Engage in discussions with local non-disabled older adults, including those who have lost a spouse, to understand their preferences and concerns. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their needs and expectations.
