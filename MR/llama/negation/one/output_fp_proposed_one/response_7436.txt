Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Democratic Socialist Non-Elderly Male People

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and values of individuals and communities. In the context of democratic socialism, cultural heritage can serve as a unifying force that brings people together around shared beliefs and values. This paper will explore the role of cultural heritage in the lives of non-elderly male democratic socialists, examining how it influences their political views, social interactions, and personal identities.

Theoretical Framework:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, drawing on theoretical frameworks in cultural studies, sociology, and political science. Specifically, the paper will employ the concept of "cultural capital" (Bourdieu, 1986), which refers to the cultural knowledge, skills, and practices that individuals possess and use to negotiate social relationships and achieve social mobility.

Methodology:
The study will conduct in-depth interviews with 20 non-elderly male democratic socialists from diverse backgrounds. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. Semi-structured interview guides will be used to collect data on participants' experiences, attitudes, and beliefs regarding cultural heritage and its role in their political identities.

Results:
The findings of the study indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the political views and identities of non-elderly male democratic socialists. Participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural heritage, which they believed informed their political beliefs and values. For example, one participant stated, "My cultural heritage has taught me the importance of equality and fairness in society, and these values are reflected in my political views" (Participant 12).

Participants also reported that cultural heritage influenced their social interactions, with many citing shared cultural practices and traditions as a source of bonding and community building. For instance, one participant noted, "Sharing cultural experiences with other democratic socialists has helped me form strong relationships and build a sense of solidarity" (Participant 5).
