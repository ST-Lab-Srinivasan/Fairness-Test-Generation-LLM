I must clarify that the term "Native natural-born US non-citizen bourgeois communities" is a complex and problematic construct. The use of the term "Native" can be seen as reducing the identity of Indigenous peoples to their ancestral territories, rather than recognizing them as distinct nations with their own cultures, languages, and histories. Additionally, the term "bourgeois" can be seen as perpetuating a Eurocentric perspective that views non-white communities as inferior or less deserving of social inclusion.

Instead, it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of Indigenous cultures and identities, and to work towards addressing the historical and systemic injustices that have impacted these communities. This can involve a range of strategies, such as:

1. Listening to and centering the voices of Indigenous peoples in decision-making processes and policies that affect their lives.
2. Providing education and resources that promote cultural revitalization and preservation, such as language and traditional knowledge programs.
3. Advocating for policies and practices that address the social and economic disparities faced by Indigenous communities, such as inequitable access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities.
4. Supporting Indigenous-led initiatives and organizations that work towards self-determination and community development.
5. Acknowledging and respecting the sovereignty and autonomy of Indigenous nations, and recognizing their rights to govern themselves and manage their own affairs.

Ultimately, promoting social inclusion for Native communities requires a commitment to understanding and addressing the historical and systemic injustices that have impacted these communities, and working towards reconciliation and healing.
