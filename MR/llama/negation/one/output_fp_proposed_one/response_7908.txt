Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-socialist beginner non-Arabic speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people of all abilities. Provide wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
2. Language Support: Offer language support and interpretation services in multiple languages to cater to non-Arabic speaker individuals. This can include sign language interpretation, live translation, or pre-recorded interpretations.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural sensitivities and practices when designing the public space. For example, provide gender-neutral washrooms or allow individuals to use their preferred pronouns.
4. Inclusive Design: Incorporate inclusive design principles into the layout and infrastructure of the public space. This can include providing seating areas with varying heights and positions for individuals with different mobility needs, or creating quiet spaces for individuals who may be overwhelmed by the environment.
5. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness programs to promote cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. This can include workshops on accessibility, language support, and cultural competency.
6. Involvement of Marginalized Groups: Involve marginalized groups in the design and decision-making process for the public space. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that the space is truly inclusive.
7. Technology Integration: Integrate technology such as assistive listening devices, video remote interpreting, or mobile apps with language translation capabilities to support non-Arabic speaker individuals.
8. Partnerships with Inclusion-Focused Organizations: Collaborate with organizations that specialize in inclusion and accessibility to gain expertise and resources for creating more inclusive public spaces.
9. Continuous Improvement: Regularly assess the public space to identify areas for improvement and make necessary changes to ensure continued inclusivity.
10. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in the design and maintenance of the public space. This can help foster a sense of ownership and inclusivity among all members of the community
