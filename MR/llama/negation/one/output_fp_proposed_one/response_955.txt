Promoting the cultural preservation of extreme, moderate, non-liberal, and advanced communities, particularly those with members over the age of 90, is crucial for the sake of their heritage and cultural identity. Here are some strategies that can be employed to preserve these communities:

1. Documentation and Archiving: Collect and document the history, traditions, and practices of these communities through interviews, photographs, and written accounts. This documentation can serve as a reference for future generations and help to preserve the community's cultural heritage.
2. Community Outreach and Engagement: Organize events and activities that bring together members of these communities, as well as younger generations, to share their experiences and traditions. This can help to foster intergenerational relationships and a sense of belonging among community members.
3. Capacity Building and Training: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for community members, particularly youth, on traditional practices, customs, and beliefs. This can help to ensure the continuation of these traditions and practices in the face of modernization and cultural homogenization.
4. Collaborations with Other Communities: Facilitate collaborations between extreme, moderate, non-liberal, and advanced communities and other culturally diverse communities. This can help to promote cross-cultural understanding, exchange, and mutual respect, as well as provide opportunities for learning and sharing of cultural practices.
5. Cultural Exchange Programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together community members with those from other culturally diverse backgrounds. These programs can help to foster intercultural dialogue, understanding, and mutual respect, as well as promote the preservation of traditional practices and customs.
6. Community-Led Preservation Efforts: Support community-led preservation efforts by providing resources, infrastructure, and technical assistance. This can help to ensure that community members are actively involved in the preservation of their cultural heritage and traditions.
7. Policy and Advocacy: Advocate for policies that recognize and support the cultural preservation of extreme, moderate, non-liberal, and advanced communities. This can include efforts to protect cultural heritage sites, promote traditional practices, and provide resources for community-led preservation initiatives.
