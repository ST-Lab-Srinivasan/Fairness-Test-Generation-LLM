Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly during sensitive periods such as pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the effects of immigration status on the lives of infants born to non-female parents in their third trimester of pregnancy. We will explore the various challenges and difficulties faced by these individuals and their families, including healthcare access, social isolation, and economic instability.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that immigration status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic well-being. For example, research has found that undocumented immigrants are more likely to experience poorer health outcomes compared to documented immigrants (Kim et al., 2015). Additionally, studies have shown that immigration status can impact an individual's social relationships and sense of belonging, with undocumented immigrants experiencing higher levels of social isolation compared to documented immigrants (Hall & Stevens, 2016).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. We will recruit participants through community-based organizations and healthcare providers serving recent immigrant populations. Participants will be interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol to gather information on their immigration status, pregnancy experience, and social and economic circumstances. A subset of participants will also complete a survey assessing their mental health and well-being.

Significance:
This study will contribute to the limited literature on the impacts of immigration status on reproductive health outcomes. By examining the experiences of infants born to non-female parents in their third trimester of pregnancy, we can better understand the challenges faced by this vulnerable population and inform interventions aimed at improving their health and well-being.

Expected Outcomes:
We anticipate that immigration status will have a significant impact on the lives of infants born to non-female parents in their third trimester of pregnancy. Specifically, we expect to find higher rates of poor prenatal care, lower birth weights, and increased risk of adverse per
