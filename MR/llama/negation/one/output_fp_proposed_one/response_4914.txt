Ensuring that the educational needs of financially disadvantaged non-young adult individuals are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities that hinder their access to quality education. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Financial aid and scholarships: Provide financial assistance through scholarships, grants, and low-interest loans to help individuals cover the costs of tuition, fees, and living expenses. This can include government-funded programs, such as Pell Grants, as well as private scholarships and foundations.
2. Adult education programs: Offer flexible and accessible adult education programs that cater to the unique needs of non-young adults. These programs can provide a range of educational opportunities, including literacy training, GED preparation, and job training in high-growth fields.
3. Online learning platforms: Utilize online learning platforms to reach a broader audience and provide more flexible access to education. This can include MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), which are free and accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
4. Partnerships with local businesses: Collaborate with local businesses to provide workforce development training and job placement services. This can help individuals gain the skills and experience they need to secure better-paying jobs and improve their financial stability.
5. Life skills training: Offer training in essential life skills, such as budgeting, time management, and goal setting. These skills are critical for financial success and can help individuals overcome the challenges of poverty and inequality.
6. Community outreach and engagement: Engage with local communities to raise awareness about the importance of education and the resources available. This can involve partnering with community organizations, hosting events and workshops, and leveraging social media to reach a wider audience.
7. Policy advocacy: Advocate for policies that support the educational needs of non-young adults, such as increased funding for adult education programs, flexible financing options, and job training initiatives.
8. Mentorship and coaching: Provide mentorship and coaching services to help individuals set and achieve their educational and career goals. This can involve matching individuals with experienced professionals who can offer guidance
