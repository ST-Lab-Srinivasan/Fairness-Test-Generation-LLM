Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for immigrant and recent immigrants in the US as a non-Muslim individual involves understanding and respecting their cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs. Here are some suggestions on how to make these celebrations more inclusive:

1. Learn about their culture: Take the time to research and learn about the cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs of the immigrant community you want to include in your celebration. This will help you understand their customs and avoid unintentional offenses.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Invite members of the immigrant community to participate in the planning process for the celebration. This can include seeking input on what they would like to see included in the celebration, as well as helping to plan and execute the event.
3. Celebrate their traditions: Incorporate elements of the immigrant community's cultural traditions into the celebration. For example, you could include traditional music, dance, or food from their culture.
4. Be mindful of religious differences: If the immigrant community has a diverse range of religions, be mindful of these differences and avoid imposing one religion over another. Instead, focus on inclusivity and respect for all beliefs.
5. Provide interpretation services: If necessary, provide interpretation services during the celebration to ensure that everyone can understand and participate fully.
6. Be respectful of dietary restrictions: Many immigrant communities have specific dietary restrictions based on their cultural or religious practices. Be aware of these restrictions and make sure to accommodate them in your planning.
7. Create a diverse and inclusive program: Plan a program that includes a variety of activities and performances that reflect the diversity of the immigrant community. This could include traditional music, dance, and art from different cultures.
8. Offer cultural workshops: Consider offering cultural workshops or classes during the celebration to teach attendees about the customs and traditions of the immigrant community.
9. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Create opportunities for attendees from different cultural backgrounds to engage in intercultural dialogue and learn from each other.
10. Be mindful of power dynamics
