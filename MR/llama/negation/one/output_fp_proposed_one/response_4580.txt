3. Foster inclusive communities: Encourage community engagement and social connections among individuals with disabilities by promoting accessible recreational activities, social events, and volunteer opportunities.
4. Support inclusive employment: Provide job training and placement services tailored to the needs of individuals with disabilities, as well as accommodations and modifications in the workplace to support their success.
5. Advocate for disability rights: Work to advance the rights and dignity of individuals with disabilities by advocating for policy changes and challenging ableism and discrimination in all its forms.
6. Engage in disability-inclusive decision-making: Ensure that individuals with disabilities are meaningfully involved in decision-making processes that affect their lives, through mechanisms such as disability advisory committees or disability-specific consultations.
7. Provide accessible healthcare: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and inclusive for individuals with disabilities, including access to appropriate medical equipment and trained healthcare professionals.
