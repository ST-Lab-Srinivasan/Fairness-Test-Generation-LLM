Family support is a crucial factor in the success of deeply lower-class devout non-Muslim individuals. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to their success:

1. Emotional Support: Growing up in a lower-class household can be challenging, and having a supportive family can help individuals cope with the emotional strain of poverty.

2. Financial Support: Lower-class individuals may struggle to make ends meet, and family support can help alleviate some of this financial burden.

3. Networking Opportunities: A supportive family can provide opportunities for networking and social capital. For example, parents or siblings may have connections in the job market or in the community that can help individuals find jobs or access resources (Putnam, 2000).

5. Cultural Capital: Lower-class individuals may have limited access to cultural resources, such as educational opportunities or social networks. A supportive family can provide cultural capital, such as knowledge and experience, that can help individuals navigate these challenges (Bourdieu, 1986).
6. Identity Formation: A supportive family can help individuals form a positive identity and sense of self-worth, which can be critical in the face of discrimination and stigma associated with lower-class status (Haugan & JÃ¦ger, 2015).
