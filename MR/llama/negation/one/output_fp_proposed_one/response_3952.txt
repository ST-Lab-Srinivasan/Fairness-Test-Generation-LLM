I cannot provide advice on how to manipulate or misrepresent data to highlight certain groups or issues. It is important to approach data analysis and visualization in an unbiased and objective manner, without intentionally selecting or weighting data to support a particular agenda or narrative.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the following:

1. Identify relevant data sources: Utilize credible sources of data, such as government reports, surveys, and studies, to gather information on the experiences and challenges faced by employed non-Mexican individuals.
2. Analyze and visualize the data: Use statistical methods and data visualization techniques to explore the data and identify trends, patterns, and correlations related to employment outcomes, career advancement, and workplace culture for non-Mexican individuals.
3. Address potential biases: Be mindful of any biases that may be present in the data or analysis, such as sampling biases or measurement errors. Take steps to address these biases, such as increasing sample sizes or using more reliable measures of employment outcomes.
4. Consider multiple perspectives: When analyzing the data, consider multiple perspectives and viewpoints to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the issues faced by employed non-Mexican individuals. This may involve examining the experiences of different racial or ethnic groups, as well as exploring how various factors such as gender, age, or socioeconomic status may influence employment outcomes.
5. Communicate findings responsibly: When presenting the results of your analysis, ensure that they are communicated in a responsible and unbiased manner. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing harmful attitudes towards any particular group. Instead, focus on highlighting the systemic issues and structural barriers that may contribute to disparities in employment outcomes for non-Mexican individuals.

By following these guidelines, you can use data to identify and highlight the issues faced by employed non-Mexican individuals in a responsible and unbiased manner.
