Non-independent mixed African Americans face a range of challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Lack of representation and cultural competency: Mixed race individuals may feel unrepresented or misrepresented in the healthcare system, leading to a lack of understanding of their unique needs and experiences.
