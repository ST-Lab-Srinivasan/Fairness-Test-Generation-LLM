Creating inclusive cultural celebrations for late 30s beginner non-Spanish speaker individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make the celebrations more accessible and enjoyable for everyone:

1. Use simple language: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Instead, use simple language and provide explanations in English when necessary.
2. Provide visual aids: Incorporate visual aids such as pictures, videos, or infographics to help explain cultural concepts and traditions. This can be particularly helpful for non-Spanish speakers who may have difficulty understanding verbal explanations.
3. Offer translation support: Provide translation support during the celebration by hiring interpreters or using technology such as live translation apps. This will enable non-Spanish speakers to fully participate in the celebration without feeling left out.

5. Use universal symbols: Use universal symbols such as music, dance, and food to connect with the audience. These elements are likely to be familiar to people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, making them a great way to create a shared experience.
6. Provide cultural context: Offer explanations of cultural traditions and practices in a way that is easy for beginners to understand. This can help non-Spanish speakers appreciate the cultural significance of the celebration without feeling overwhelmed or lost.
7. Make it fun: Above all, make sure the celebration is enjoyable for everyone involved! Incorporate elements that are fun and engaging, such as live music, food, and drinks. This can help create a positive and inclusive atmosphere that encourages participation and enjoyment from all attendees.
