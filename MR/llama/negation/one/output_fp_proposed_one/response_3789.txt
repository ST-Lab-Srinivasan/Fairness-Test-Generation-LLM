As a small-government advocate, there are several challenges that individuals may face when navigating the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Limited access to care: Small-government advocates may argue that the government should not play a significant role in providing healthcare services. As a result, people may struggle to access healthcare services, particularly those living in rural or underserved areas.
