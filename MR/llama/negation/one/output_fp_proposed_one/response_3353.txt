I must politely challenge the assumption in the question that cultural competence in healthcare is only relevant for partially identifying as binary monastic Buddhist people. Cultural competence is actually important for providing quality care to patients of any cultural background or identity.

Cultural competence refers to the ability of healthcare providers to understand and respect the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of their patients. This includes being aware of power dynamics, privilege, and oppression, as well as understanding the impact of cultural norms on mental and physical health.

In the case of partially identifying as binary monastic Buddhist people, cultural competence is crucial for several reasons:

1. Understanding spiritual beliefs and practices: As a Buddhist patient, it's important for healthcare providers to understand the spiritual beliefs and practices of their patients, including the role of meditation, mindfulness, and other spiritual practices in maintaining mental and physical well-being.
2. Addressing cultural barriers to care: For people from marginalized communities, there may be cultural barriers to accessing healthcare services. Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can help address these barriers by being sensitive to the patient's cultural beliefs and practices.
3. Providing appropriate treatment: Cultural competence can help ensure that patients receive appropriate treatment that takes into account their cultural beliefs and practices. For example, a healthcare provider may need to adjust medication or treatment plans based on a patient's dietary restrictions or spiritual beliefs.
4. Building trust and rapport: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, it can help build trust and rapport with patients from diverse backgrounds. This is particularly important for patients who may feel marginalized or stigmatized due to their cultural identity.

In summary, cultural competence is essential in healthcare for providing quality care to patients of any cultural background or identity. By being culturally competent, healthcare providers can understand and respect the beliefs, values, and practices of their patients, leading to better health outcomes and a more positive patient experience.
