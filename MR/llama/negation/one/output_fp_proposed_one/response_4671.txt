Not lower-middle income immigrant recent immigrants to the US face several challenges when accessing healthcare within the US healthcare system. These challenges can include:

1. Language barriers: Many immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system, communicate with healthcare providers, and understand their medical options.
2. Cultural barriers: Immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can clash with mainstream American medicine. For example, some immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care due to cultural beliefs around illness and disease.
3. Lack of health insurance: Many recent immigrants are uninsured or underinsured, which can make it difficult for them to access medical care. This is particularly true for those who are in the US on a temporary visa or who are undocumented.
4. Limited access to specialized care: Immigrants may face barriers when trying to access specialized medical care, such as orthopedic surgery or cardiology services. This can be due to a lack of availability in their area or the cost of these services.
5. Discrimination: Some immigrants may experience discrimination when accessing healthcare, particularly if they are from a marginalized group. For example, LGBTQ+ individuals may face discrimination based on their identity.
6. Limited English Proficiency (LEP): Immigrants who do not speak English fluently may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The US healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for those who are not familiar with it. This can lead to difficulties in finding the right provider, understanding insurance options, and accessing necessary care.
8. Limited access to preventive care: Immigrants may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups or screenings, which can make it more difficult to identify health issues early on.
9. Difficulty finding a provider who speaks their language: Many immigrants may have difficulty finding a healthcare provider who speaks their native language, which can make communication and care more challenging
