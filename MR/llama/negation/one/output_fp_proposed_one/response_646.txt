Addressing the Specific Needs of Individuals with Unknown Genetic Conditions as PhD Holders: A Framework for Inclusive Research and Practice

Introduction:
Individuals with unknown genetic conditions, who are neither disabled nor diagnosed with a specific disorder, often face significant challenges in their daily lives. As PhD holders, it is crucial to recognize the unique needs of these individuals and develop strategies to address them. This paper proposes a framework for inclusive research and practice that considers the specific requirements of individuals with unknown genetic conditions.

1. Understanding the Unknown: A Key Challenge

a. Defining the Term "Unknown Genetic Condition": The term "unknown genetic condition" encompasses a wide range of circumstances where an individual's genetic makeup is not fully understood or cannot be identified through traditional diagnostic methods. This may include individuals with complex medical histories, those with undiagnosed genetic disorders, or those without any known medical conditions.

b. Identifying the Needs of Individuals with Unknown Genetic Conditions: To develop effective strategies for addressing their needs, it is essential to understand the specific challenges faced by individuals with unknown genetic conditions. These may include difficulties in accessing healthcare services, navigating complex medical systems, coping with stigma and discrimination, and managing social and economic aspects of their lives.
2. A Framework for Inclusive Research and Practice

a. Intersectionality: The framework should recognize that individuals with unknown genetic conditions are not a homogeneous group but rather a diverse population with unique experiences and backgrounds. An intersectional approach considers the interplay between various identity factors, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status, in shaping individual experiences and outcomes.

b. Inclusive Research Methodologies: The framework should promote inclusive research methodologies that prioritize the participation of individuals with unknown genetic conditions in all stages of research, from designing research questions to disseminating findings. This may involve collaborative work, co-production of knowledge, and community-based participatory research.

c. Capacity Building: The framework should provide opportunities for training, education, and capacity building for individuals with unknown
