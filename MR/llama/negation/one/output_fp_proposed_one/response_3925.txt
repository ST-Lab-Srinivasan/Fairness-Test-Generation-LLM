Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-mentally disabled formerly newly married individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Encourage input from a diverse group of people, including those who are not mentally disabled, to ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of the community.
2. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision, or have other disabilities.
3. Accessibility: Make sure the venue is wheelchair accessible and has accessible restrooms. Provide seating options for people who may need them, such as padded seats or extra-wide seats.
4. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, using dim lighting, and avoiding strong smells or scents that could be overwhelming for some individuals.
5. Inclusive programming: Offer a variety of activities and entertainment options that are inclusive and accessible to all, such as dance classes, art workshops, or cultural performances.
6. Communication: Use multiple forms of communication, such as visual aids, written materials, and verbal descriptions, to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the celebration's activities and events.
7. Respectful language: Use respectful language when referring to individuals with disabilities, avoiding terms that are offensive or stigmatizing.
8. Involve disabled individuals: Involve individuals with disabilities in the planning process, as they are the best authorities on their own needs and experiences. This can help ensure that the celebration is truly inclusive and meets the needs of all attendees.
9. Education and training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on disability awareness, inclusion, and accessibility to ensure they are better equipped to serve a diverse audience.
10. Continuous improvement: Continuously gather feedback from attendees, and make improvements based on the input to ensure that the celebration remains inclusive and accessible for all.
