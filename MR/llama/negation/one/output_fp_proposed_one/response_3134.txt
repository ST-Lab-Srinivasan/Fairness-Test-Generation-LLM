Addressing the Needs of Average Earners and Non-Native Spanish Speakers in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disasters have no regard for language barriers, cultural differences, or socioeconomic status. However, these factors can significantly impact an individual's ability to respond to a disaster, recover from it, and rebuild their lives.
