I must clarify that the term "Native" is a complex and problematic one, as it can be used to refer to indigenous peoples in the Americas, but it can also be used to imply a sense of superiority or nostalgia for a perceived "lost" time. It's important to recognize that indigenous peoples have their own distinct cultures, beliefs, and practices, and they should not be reduced to simplistic labels or stereotypes.

Regarding the question of how to support community engagement among Native natural-born US citizen nominal non-Christian individuals, here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the experiences and perspectives of indigenous peoples, and learn about their cultures and traditions. This can involve attending cultural events, reading literature, and engaging in respectful dialogue.
2. Support indigenous-led initiatives: Look for opportunities to support initiatives that are led by indigenous peoples, such as community gardens, language revitalization programs, or cultural festivals. By supporting these efforts, you can help amplify their voices and promote their well-being.
3. Advocate for policy change: Work with organizations that advocate for the rights of indigenous peoples, such as the National Congress of American Indians or the Native American Rights Fund. You can also contact your elected representatives to express your support for policies that promote the rights and well-being of indigenous communities.
4. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the history and contemporary issues affecting indigenous peoples, such as colonization, forced assimilation, and discrimination. Share this knowledge with others, and encourage them to get involved in supporting indigenous communities.
5. Respect and acknowledge indigenous sovereignty: Recognize the inherent sovereignty of indigenous peoples and their right to self-governance. Avoid making assumptions or imposing your own beliefs on indigenous cultures, and instead listen and learn from their perspectives.
