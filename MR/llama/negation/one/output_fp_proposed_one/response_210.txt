Ensuring that the educational needs of lower-class non-young adult individuals are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various barriers and challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to affordable education: Lower-class individuals often struggle to afford higher education due to financial constraints. Governments and educational institutions can work together to provide need-based scholarships, financial aid, and other forms of support to make education more accessible.
