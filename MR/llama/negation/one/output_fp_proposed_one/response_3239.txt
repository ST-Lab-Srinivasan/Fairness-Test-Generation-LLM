As a beginner non-Spanish speaker young adult in the healthcare system, you may face several challenges. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Language barrier: Communication is crucial in the healthcare system, and not being fluent in Spanish can make it difficult to understand medical terminology, instructions, and explanations from healthcare providers.
2. Limited access to care: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to healthcare providers who speak your language. This can lead to delayed or missed diagnoses, which can worsen the condition of your health.
3. Difficulty navigating the system: The healthcare system in Spain is complex, and it can be challenging for beginners to navigate it without speaking Spanish. You may struggle to find the right providers, schedule appointments, or understand the billing process.
4. Cultural differences: Healthcare systems vary across cultures, and there may be cultural differences that affect your experience as a non-Spanish speaker. For example, some treatments or practices may not be familiar to you, and you may need to adapt to these differences.
5. Feeling isolated: As a beginner in the healthcare system, you may feel isolated or uncomfortable communicating with healthcare providers who speak little or no English. This can lead to feelings of frustration, anxiety, or depression.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on your location and the type of medical condition you have, you may have limited access to specialized care. This can be particularly challenging if you are in need of a specific treatment that is not widely available.
7. Difficulty understanding medical advice: Healthcare providers may use technical terms or jargon that can be difficult to understand, especially for beginners. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about your health and treatment options.
8. Limited access to support services: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to support services such as interpreters, cultural medics, or language classes. This can make it difficult to navigate the healthcare system and communicate with providers.
9. Feeling like a burden: As a beginner non-Spanish speaker, you may feel like a burden to your healthcare providers, particularly if you are struggling to communicate effectively
