Creating more inclusive cultural events for newly married non-civilian individuals involves understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural events more welcoming:

1. Inclusive Invitations: Make sure your invitations are inclusive and respectful of the individual's identity and beliefs. Avoid using language that assumes a civilian status, such as "non-civilian" or "military spouse." Instead, use language that is neutral and welcoming, such as "all guests."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that your event location is accessible to all guests, including those with disabilities. Provide clear instructions on how to access the venue, and offer accommodations such as wheelchair ramps or Braille signage.
3. Diverse Entertainment: Offer a variety of entertainment options that cater to different tastes and preferences. This could include live music, dance performances, or cultural activities that reflect the individual's heritage.
4. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow guests to engage with each other and the culture. For example, you could organize a cultural quiz or game night that encourages guests to learn about each other's traditions.
5. Food and Beverage Options: Offer a range of food and beverage options that cater to different dietary restrictions and preferences. This could include vegetarian, gluten-free, and halal options, as well as non-alcoholic drinks for those who do not consume alcohol.
6. Cultural Education: Provide educational resources or workshops that teach guests about the culture they are celebrating. This could include traditional dances, music, or crafts that guests can learn and participate in.
7. Interpretation Services: If you have guests who speak different languages, consider hiring interpretation services to facilitate communication between them. This will ensure that everyone can fully participate in the event.
8. Respectful Dress Code: Set a respectful dress code for the event, taking into account the cultural norms of the individuals involved. Avoid assumptions about what clothing is appropriate based on gender or civilian status.
9. Involve the Community: Encourage community involvement by inviting local cultural groups or organizations
