Ensuring that the housing needs of non-permanent residents aged 65 and older are met can be challenging, as they may not have the same rights and access to resources as permanent residents. However, there are several strategies that can help address this issue:

1. Inclusive Housing Policies: Develop inclusive housing policies that recognize the rights of non-permanent residents, including those who have recently turned 65. These policies should aim to provide affordable and accessible housing options for all residents, regardless of their immigration status.
2. Partnership with Community Organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that specialize in supporting non-permanent residents, such as settlement agencies or advocacy groups. These organizations can help identify the specific housing needs of this population and provide support in finding affordable housing options.
3. Capacity Building: Provide training and resources to housing providers, landlords, and property managers on how to accommodate non-permanent residents. This can include information on accessible design and inclusive practices, as well as cultural competency training to better serve diverse populations.
4. Affordable Housing Options: Develop and maintain affordable housing options specifically for non-permanent residents, such as rent-geared-to-income units or supportive housing programs. These options should be designed with the unique needs of this population in mind, including accessibility features and on-site support services.
5. Outreach and Engagement: Conduct targeted outreach and engagement efforts to reach non-permanent residents who may be eligible for housing assistance but are not yet connected to local resources. This can include door-to-door canvassing, community events, and partnerships with local service providers.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that address the specific needs of non-permanent residents, such as expanding eligibility for rent control or increasing funding for affordable housing programs. This can help ensure that there are more options available for this population.
7. Alternative Housing Models: Explore alternative housing models, such as cooperative housing or community land trusts, which can provide more affordable and sustainable housing options for non-permanent residents
