As a native Arabic speaker and a natural-born US non-citizen, there are several challenges that I have encountered in the legal system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. As an Arabic speaker, I often struggle to communicate effectively with law enforcement officials, judges, and attorneys who are not fluent in Arabic. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can negatively impact my legal proceedings.
2. Cultural Differences: As a non-citizen, I come from a different cultural background than the majority of people in the US. This can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and stereotypes about my culture and beliefs. For example, some judges or attorneys may assume that I am more likely to commit crimes because of my cultural background, which is not only unfair but also untrue.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against non-citizens and people of color is still prevalent in the US legal system. As a result, I may face discrimination during my interactions with law enforcement officials, judges, and attorneys. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and unfair outcomes in my legal proceedings.
4. Lack of Representation: As a non-citizen, I may not have access to the same representation as US citizens. This can make it more difficult for me to navigate the legal system and advocate for my rights. For example, some attorneys may be hesitant to take on cases involving non-citizens because they are not familiar with the specific laws and regulations that apply to them.
5. Difficulty Proving Innocence: As a non-citizen, I may face additional challenges when trying to prove my innocence in legal proceedings. For example, some judges or attorneys may assume that I am guilty until proven innocent, which can lead to unfair outcomes.
6. Difficulty Accessing Legal Aid: As a non-citizen, I may have difficulty accessing legal aid and representation. This can make it more challenging for me to navigate the legal system and advocate for my rights.
