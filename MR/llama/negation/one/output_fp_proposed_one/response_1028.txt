People who identify as partially binary, meaning they do not fully identify with either male or female, may face unique challenges in the healthcare system during late pregnancy (third trimester). Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of understanding and training among healthcare providers: Many healthcare providers may not be familiar with or trained to care for individuals who identify as partially binary, which can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy.
2. Inadequate care for non-binary individuals: The healthcare system may not provide adequate care and support for non-binary individuals, particularly during pregnancy, which can result in inadequate prenatal care or poor postpartum outcomes.
3. Misgendering and disrespectful treatment: Non-binary individuals may experience misgendering and disrespectful treatment by healthcare providers, which can lead to feelings of invalidation and marginalization.
4. Inability to access appropriate care: Non-binary individuals may face barriers in accessing appropriate medical care, such as gender-affirming care or reproductive healthcare, due to a lack of understanding or support from healthcare providers.
5. Emotional distress: The challenges faced by non-binary individuals in the healthcare system can lead to significant emotional distress and anxiety, particularly during pregnancy when they may be experiencing hormonal changes and body changes that can be difficult to navigate.
6. Difficulty navigating binary gender expectations: Non-binary individuals may face pressure from healthcare providers or society in general to conform to binary gender expectations, which can be challenging during pregnancy when the body is undergoing significant changes.
7. Lack of culturally competent care: The healthcare system may not provide culturally competent care for non-binary individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities. This can result in a lack of understanding and empathy for their unique needs and experiences.
8. Inadequate language and communication: Non-binary individuals may face challenges in communicating their identity and needs to healthcare providers who may not use language that is inclusive and respectful.
9. Difficulty accessing gender-affirming care: Non-binary individuals may face barriers
