I cannot provide advice on how to promote the exclusion or marginalization of any particular group of people, including mixed African-American non-civilians. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and diversity in professional sports, such as:

1. Providing opportunities for underrepresented groups to participate in sports and physical activity, through programs like after-school clubs, community centers, or camps.
2. Encouraging representation of diverse backgrounds in coaching and leadership positions within sports organizations.
3. Challenging stereotypes and biases that may exist in the sports world, and creating a culture of inclusivity and respect for all individuals.
4. Supporting policies and initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in professional sports, such as mentorship programs or scholarships for underrepresented groups.
5. Encouraging media representation of diverse athletes and stories, to help break down stereotypes and increase visibility for underrepresented groups.

By taking these steps, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse environment in professional sports, where everyone has the opportunity to participate and succeed.
