Supporting the mental health of newly non-married people during the third trimester of pregnancy can be crucial. Here are some ways to provide support:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Newly non-married people may feel anxious, stressed, or overwhelmed during this time. Offer a listening ear and validate their emotions, reminding them that it's okay to feel this way.
2. Encourage self-care: Pregnancy can be an exhausting experience, both physically and emotionally. Encourage newly non-married people to prioritize self-care activities like taking breaks, practicing relaxation techniques, or engaging in activities they enjoy.
3. Provide resources: Offer to provide information on prenatal mental health services, postpartum depression support groups, and other resources that can help newly non-married people navigate their mental health during this time.
4. Be a sounding board: Allow newly non-married people to express their thoughts and feelings without judgment. Listen actively and provide feedback in a non-judgmental manner.
5. Respect their boundaries: Respect newly non-married people's boundaries and decisions regarding their pregnancy and postpartum care. Avoid making unsolicited advice or pushing them to do things they are not comfortable with.
6. Offer practical support: Help newly non-married people with errands, grocery shopping, or household tasks to reduce their stress levels and allow them to focus on their mental health.
7. Connect them with peers: Introduce newly non-married people to other expectant or new parents who are going through similar experiences. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to their community.
8. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that newly non-married people may be dealing with a lot of emotions during this time, including anxiety, fear, and excitement. Be patient and understanding when they need extra support or time to process their feelings.
9. Encourage professional help: If newly non-married people are struggling with their mental health during pregnancy or postpartum, encourage them to seek professional help from a licensed therapist or counselor.
