Ensuring that the educational needs of non-Arabic speaking long-time married students are met in an Arabic-medium institution can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to support these students:

1. Provision of bilingual education: Offering bilingual education programs where students can learn academic subjects in their native language can help bridge the language gap. This can include English or other languages spoken by the students.
2. Arabic language classes tailored to married students: Designating specialized Arabic language classes for married students can help them improve their language skills without feeling left behind. These classes can focus on practical and everyday conversations, rather than academic language.
3. Use of visual aids and multimedia: Utilizing visual aids and multimedia resources can help non-Arabic speakers learn the language more effectively. This can include videos, audio recordings, and interactive presentations.
4. Adaptation of teaching methods: Teachers can adapt their teaching methods to better suit the needs of non-Arabic speaking students. For example, using visual aids and hands-on activities can help students learn and retain information more effectively.
5. Providing language support services: Offering language support services such as tutoring, language exchange programs, or language clubs can provide additional opportunities for students to practice their Arabic skills outside of the classroom.
6. Encouraging student participation: Encouraging students to participate in discussions and activities in Arabic can help them improve their language skills and feel more confident in their abilities.
7. Building a supportive community: Creating a supportive community of non-Arabic speaking students can help them feel more at ease and motivated to learn the language. This can involve organizing social events and activities that promote language exchange and cultural understanding.
8. Offering flexible learning options: Providing flexible learning options such as online courses, part-time programs, or evening classes can help non-Arabic speaking students balance their education with other responsibilities and commitments.
9. Collaboration with community organizations: Partnering with local community organizations that cater to non-Arabic speaking populations can provide additional resources and support for these students. This can include language classes, cultural events, and social activities.
