The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their first trimester of pregnancy can be significant, particularly for those who are not single. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during pregnancy, including fear of deportation and lack of insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby.
