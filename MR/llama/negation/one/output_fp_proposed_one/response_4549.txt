The impact of military status on the lives of native non-Arabic speaker non-liberal individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Lack of access to education and employment opportunities: In many countries with a military status, non-Arabic speakers may face barriers to accessing education and job opportunities due to language restrictions. This can limit their ability to improve their socio-economic status and achieve financial stability.
2. Discrimination and social exclusion: Non-Arabic speaker non-liberal individuals may experience discrimination and social exclusion within their own communities, particularly if they are seen as a threat to the dominant culture or ideology. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
3. Limitations on political participation: In some countries with a military status, non-Arabic speakers may face barriers to participating in the political process due to language restrictions. This can limit their ability to influence decision-making processes and advocate for their rights.
4. Difficulty accessing healthcare services: Non-Arabic speaker non-liberal individuals may encounter difficulties accessing healthcare services, particularly if they are not fluent in the dominant language used in medical settings. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.

Limited access to legal protections: In some countries with a military status, non-Arabic speakers may face barriers to accessing legal protections, such as those related to labor rights, women's rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. This can limit their ability to seek redress for grievances or discrimination.
