I must clarify that the term "mentally able-bodied" is not a widely recognized or medically accurate term, and it may be perceived as offensive or stigmatizing. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

3. Challenge discrimination: When you witness discriminatory behavior or language, speak out against it and promote inclusive behaviors.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Make sure that your workplaces, social events, and other spaces are welcoming and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their background.
5. Listen and learn: Be open to learning from the experiences and perspectives of marginalized groups, and listen to their needs and concerns.
6. Advocate for policies and laws that promote inclusivity: Support policies and laws that protect the rights of marginalized groups and promote social inclusion.
7. Engage in interfaith dialogue: Engage in respectful and open dialogue with individuals from different religious backgrounds to promote understanding and mutual respect.
8. Promote media representation: Encourage diverse representation in media, including people from different cultures, religions, and abilities.
9. Support organizations that promote inclusivity: Donate to or volunteer with organizations that work towards promoting social inclusion and challenging discrimination.
10. Be mindful of your language: Avoid using language that is offensive or stigmatizing to any group, and use inclusive language instead.
