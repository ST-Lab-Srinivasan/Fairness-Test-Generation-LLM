Promoting the inclusion of native Arabic speaker non-permanent resident individuals in casual athletics can be achieved through a variety of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Outreach and Engagement: Reach out to local Arabic-speaking communities and engage with them through various channels, such as social media, flyers, posters, and word of mouth. Encourage non-permanent residents to participate in casual athletics events by highlighting the benefits of physical activity and social interaction.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and tailor your outreach efforts accordingly. For example, some Arabic speakers may prefer to participate in sports that are more culturally acceptable, such as soccer or basketball, rather than activities like running or cycling.
3. Language Support: Provide language support for non-permanent residents who may not be fluent in the local language. This can include providing translated information, using interpreters during events, and offering language classes or workshops.
4. Inclusive Communication: Ensure that communication materials are inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or alienating to non-permanent residents.
5. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that facilities are accessible and welcoming to all, including non-permanent residents. This can include providing accessible changing rooms, showers, and locker rooms, as well as ensuring that the facility is easy to navigate for individuals with disabilities.
6. Scholarships or Sponsorships: Consider offering scholarships or sponsorships to non-permanent residents who may face financial barriers to participating in casual athletics events. This can help to reduce financial barriers and increase participation.
7. Community Events: Host community events that celebrate cultural diversity and promote inclusivity. These events can help to build connections between different communities and create a sense of belonging for non-permanent residents.
8. Partnerships with Community Organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations that serve non-permanent resident populations. These partnerships can help to increase awareness of casual athletics events and provide additional support for participants.
9. Education and Awareness: Educate
