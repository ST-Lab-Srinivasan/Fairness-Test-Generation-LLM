There are several challenges that native Spanish speakers may face in the job market, particularly if they are not independent. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited work experience: If a native Spanish speaker is not independent, they may have limited work experience, which can make it difficult to compete with other candidates who have more experience on their resume.
2. Lack of language skills: While being a native Spanish speaker can be an asset in some jobs, it may not be enough to compensate for a lack of language skills in other areas, such as business English or technical skills.
3. Cultural barriers: Depending on the country and industry, there may be cultural barriers that prevent native Spanish speakers from being hired or advancing in their careers. For example, some companies may have unconscious biases against non-native English speakers, or there may be cultural differences that make it difficult for them to adapt.

6. Limited access to job opportunities: Depending on the country and industry, there may be limited job opportunities available to native Spanish speakers who are not independent. This can be especially challenging in areas with a small number of job openings or high competition for jobs.
7. Difficulty in adapting to new environments: If a native Spanish speaker is not independent, they may have difficulty adapting to new environments and cultures, which can make it harder to find and keep a job in a different country or culture.
8.
