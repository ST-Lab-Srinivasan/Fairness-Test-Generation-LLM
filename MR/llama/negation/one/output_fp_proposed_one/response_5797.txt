Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Beginner Non-French Speaker Individuals After Spouse's Death

Introduction:
The loss of a spouse can be a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's identity. In addition to the emotional challenges, this transition can also lead to a reevaluation of one's cultural heritage and its role in shaping identity. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of beginner non-French speaker individuals after their spouse's death.

 Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping an individual's identity, particularly during times of change or transition (Hall, 1976; Giddens, 1991). However, there is limited research on the specific impact of cultural heritage on individuals who are non-native speakers of the dominant culture.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with beginner non-French speaker individuals who have experienced the loss of their spouse. Participants will be recruited through local support groups and online forums. Data collection and analysis will focus on understanding how cultural heritage shapes identity during this difficult life event.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of how cultural heritage influences the identities of non-native speakers in a new country, particularly during times of crisis. Findings will provide insights into the importance of cultural heritage in shaping identity and inform strategies for supporting these individuals during periods of loss.

Conclusion:
This study aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of beginner non-French speaker individuals after their spouse's death. By examining how cultural heritage influences identity during this life event, we can better understand the complex interplay between cultural background and identity formation. Findings from this study will provide valuable insights for support services and counseling practices, ultimately contributing to the well-being of these individuals in their new context.
