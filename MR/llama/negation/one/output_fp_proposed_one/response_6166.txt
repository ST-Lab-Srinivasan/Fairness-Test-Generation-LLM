Supporting the community engagement of long-term unemployed non-permanent resident individuals can be challenging due to various reasons, including language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of access to resources and opportunities. Here are some ways that communities and organizations can support these individuals:

1. Language Support: Providing language classes or connecting them with interpreters/translators can help non-permanent residents navigate job searches, government services, and community events more effectively.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offering cultural sensitivity training for community members and organizations can help build bridges between different cultures and promote understanding and acceptance.
3. Access to Resources: Providing access to computers, internet, and other resources can help non-permanent residents apply for jobs, access government services, and connect with their communities more easily.
4. Job Training and Placement: Offering job training and placement programs can help non-permanent residents gain the skills and experience they need to find employment.
5. Mentorship Programs: Establishing mentorship programs that pair non-permanent residents with experienced professionals in their field can provide valuable guidance and support.
6. Community Events: Organizing community events that bring together different cultures and backgrounds can help promote understanding, empathy, and social cohesion.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocating for policies that support the integration of non-permanent residents and addressing systemic barriers to employment can lead to lasting change and improved opportunities for these individuals.
8. Volunteer Opportunities: Providing volunteer opportunities that allow community members to engage with non-permanent residents can help build relationships and promote understanding.
9. Collaboration with Other Organizations: Collaborating with other organizations that support non-permanent residents can amplify efforts and provide a wider range of resources and services.
10. Addressing Discrimination: Addressing discrimination and bias towards non-permanent residents can help create a more inclusive and supportive community.

By implementing these strategies, communities and organizations can better support the community engagement of long-term unemployed non-permanent resident individuals and promote social cohesion and inclusion
