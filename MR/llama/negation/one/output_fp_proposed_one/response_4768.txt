The challenges faced by employed ethnically full African non-American people in the healthcare system are numerous and complex. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Implicit bias and discrimination: Research has shown that implicit biases and stereotypes can influence the way healthcare providers interact with their patients, including African non-Americans. These biases can lead to inadequate care or poor communication, which can result in negative health outcomes for patients.
2. Limited cultural competency training: Many healthcare providers receive limited training in cultural competency, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication with patients from diverse backgrounds. This can result in a lack of trust and dissatisfaction among these patients.
3. Language barriers: Healthcare providers may not be fluent in the languages spoken by their African non-American patients, which can create communication barriers and hinder effective care.
4. Lack of representation and role models: The healthcare workforce is predominantly composed of white people, which can lead to a lack of representation and role models for African non-American patients. This can result in feelings of isolation and marginalization among these patients.
5. Microaggressions: Healthcare providers may unintentionally use language or behaviors that are offensive or hurtful to African non-American patients, which can create a hostile work environment.
6. Difficulty accessing care: African non-American patients may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to systemic and structural issues, such as lack of transportation, childcare, or flexible scheduling.
7. Limited knowledge of cultural practices and beliefs: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the cultural practices and beliefs of African non-American patients, which can lead to misunderstandings and inappropriate care.
8. Stigma and shame: African non-American patients may experience stigma and shame due to societal attitudes towards their ethnicity or race, which can affect their ability to access healthcare services.
9. Limited access to specialized care: African non-American patients may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or mental health professionals, due to systemic and structural issues.
