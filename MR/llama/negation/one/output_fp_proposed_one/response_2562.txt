Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-traditional individuals, such as those who are non-binary, divorced, or have had multiple partners, requires careful consideration and a willingness to challenge traditional norms and expectations. Here are some strategies that can help make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse representation in planning and decision-making processes: Ensure that the planning committee for cultural celebrations includes individuals from diverse backgrounds, identities, and experiences. This can help ensure that the celebration is representative of the community and that the needs of all individuals are taken into account.
2. Use inclusive language and imagery: Avoid using language or images that reinforce binary gender norms or assume heterosexuality. Instead, use language and imagery that is inclusive of all genders and sexualities. For example, use terms like "partner" or "significant other" instead of "husband" or "wife."
3. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Cultural celebrations often involve adopting traditions and practices from different cultures. However, it's important to be mindful of cultural appropriation and ensure that the cultural practices being adopted are respectful and not exploitative. Give credit to the originating culture and be aware of power dynamics.
4. Offer accommodations for individuals with disabilities: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
5. Provide gender-neutral restrooms: Make sure there are gender-neutral restrooms available at the celebration location. This can help ensure that all individuals feel comfortable and included.
6. Encourage participation from diverse groups: Encourage participation from diverse groups, such as those who may not have been traditionally included in cultural celebrations. For example, involve marginalized communities in the planning process or provide opportunities for individuals to share their stories and experiences.
7. Be flexible with gender roles: Allow individuals to express themselves in ways that feel authentic to them, without adhering to traditional gender roles. For example, allow individuals to take on traditionally "feminine" or "masculine" roles if that feels most comfortable for them.
8. Provide inclusive food options:
