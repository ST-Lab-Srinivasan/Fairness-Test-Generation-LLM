As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "natural-born non-citizen" is not a legally recognized or appropriate term. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status or nationality.

Regarding the challenges faced by non-citizens in the healthcare system, there are several barriers that can affect their access to healthcare services. Some of these include:

1. Lack of health insurance: Non-citizens may not have access to health insurance due to their immigration status or lack of eligibility for government-funded programs. This can make it difficult for them to afford medical care, including preventive services and emergency treatment.
2. Language barriers: Non-citizens may face language barriers that can hinder their ability to communicate effectively with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, which can result in inadequate care.
3. Cultural and religious beliefs: Non-citizens may have cultural or religious beliefs that conflict with medical practices or procedures. Healthcare providers must be sensitive to these beliefs and take steps to accommodate them while still providing appropriate care.
4. Fear of deportation: Non-citizens may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities and facing deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for their health.
5. Discrimination: Non-citizens may face discrimination in the healthcare system based on their immigration status. This can result in a lack of trust in the healthcare system and decreased access to care.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Non-citizens may have limited access to specialized care, such as mental health services or complex surgeries, due to their immigration status or lack of insurance coverage.
7. Lack of awareness: Non-citizens may be unaware of the resources available to them in the healthcare system or may not know how to access them. This can lead to a lack of utilization of services and poor health outcomes.
8. Cost: Non-citizens may face financial barriers
