However, I can suggest some ways to support the social inclusion of recent immigrants to India, regardless of their political beliefs:

1. Encourage cross-cultural understanding and exchange: Organize events or programs that bring together people from different cultural backgrounds to learn about each other's traditions, customs, and beliefs. This can help foster mutual respect and understanding.
2. Promote language learning and literacy: Many recent immigrants may face challenges in navigating India's complex language landscape. Offer language classes or resources to help them improve their proficiency in the local language(s).
3. Provide access to education and job training: Offer vocational training or academic programs that cater to the specific needs of recent immigrants, such as skills development or job placement services. This can help them integrate into the Indian job market more easily.
4. Foster community building: Encourage recent immigrants to participate in community events or activities that promote social bonding and networking. This can help them connect with like-minded individuals and build a sense of belonging in their new community.
5. Advocate for policy reforms: Work with government agencies or advocacy groups to push for policies that address the specific needs of recent immigrants, such as streamlined visa processes or access to social services.
6. Offer mental health support: Recent immigrants may face unique challenges related to cultural adjustment, language barriers, and discrimination. Provide access to mental health resources or counseling services to help them cope with these challenges.
7. Create inclusive spaces: Design public spaces or community centers that are welcoming and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their cultural background or political beliefs. This can help foster a sense of belonging and social inclusion.
8. Promote interfaith dialogue:
