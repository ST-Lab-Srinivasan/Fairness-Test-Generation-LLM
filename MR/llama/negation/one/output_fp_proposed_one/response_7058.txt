Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed African-Non-American Nominal Christians

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African-non-American nominal Christians. The intersectionality of race, ethnicity, religion, and cultural background creates a complex identity that is unique to each individual. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed African-non-American nominal Christians and their spiritual practices.

Theory:
Cultural heritage can be defined as the shared values, customs, beliefs, and practices of a particular group or society (Hood, 1999). For mixed African-non-American nominal Christians, cultural heritage encompasses both the African and non-African aspects of their identity. This includes the religious traditions and practices of their ancestors, as well as the social norms and expectations of their communities.

The concept of "mixed" or "biracial" identity is complex and can pose challenges to individuals' sense of self (Hoyt, 2013). The intersectionality of race, ethnicity, religion, and cultural background creates a multifaceted identity that can be difficult to navigate. However, cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and connection to one's roots, which is essential for the formation of identity (Hood, 1999).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with mixed African-non-American nominal Christians. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposeful sampling techniques. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed for analysis.

Data Analysis:
The data will be analyzed using thematic analysis, which allows for the identification of patterns and themes within the data (Braun & Clarke, 2013). The researcher will explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed African-non-American nominal Christians and their spiritual practices.

Expected Findings:
This study anticipates that cultural heritage will play a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African-non-American nominal Christians. The find
