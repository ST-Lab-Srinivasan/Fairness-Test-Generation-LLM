Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mid-50s beginner non-Spanish speaker individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to make the celebration more accessible and enjoyable for everyone:

1. Provide English language support: Offer translation support through subtitles or an interpreter during cultural events, presentations, or performances. This will help non-Spanish speakers follow along and participate in the celebration without feeling left out.
2. Use visual aids: Incorporate visual aids such as pictures, videos, or props to illustrate cultural practices, customs, and traditions. This can help non-Spanish speakers understand and appreciate the culture better.
3. Simplify language barriers: Use simple language and avoid complex cultural references that may be difficult for non-Spanish speakers to follow. Instead, focus on the basics of the culture, such as traditional foods, music, or holidays.
4. Involve participants: Encourage non-Spanish speakers to participate in cultural activities, such as singing, dancing, or cooking. This will help them feel more connected to the culture and enjoy the celebration more.
5. Offer cultural immersion experiences: Provide opportunities for non-Spanish speakers to immerse themselves in the culture through hands-on activities, such as language classes, cooking workshops, or traditional dance lessons.
6. Use technology: Utilize technology, such as apps or online resources, to provide cultural information and support to non-Spanish speakers. This can include interactive language learning tools, cultural facts and trivia, or virtual cultural events.
7. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the celebration venue is accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, or assistive listening devices.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultures and backgrounds present at the celebration. Encourage participants to share their own cultural practices and traditions, fostering a sense of inclusivity and mutual respect.
9. Provide cultural context: Offer historical and cultural context for the events being celebrated, helping non-Spanish speakers understand the significance and relevance
