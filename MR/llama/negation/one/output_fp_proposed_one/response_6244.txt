Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US non-reservist individuals in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique cultural, social, and historical context. Here are some strategies that educators and policymakers can adopt to support these individuals:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American recent immigrants may have diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences. Educators should incorporate culturally responsive teaching practices into their classrooms, which involve understanding and valuing the students' cultural identities and experiences. This can include using culturally relevant texts, images, and other materials in the classroom.
2. Language support: Native American recent immigrants may speak indigenous languages or have limited proficiency in English. Educators should provide language support services, such as bilingual education programs or language interpretation services, to ensure that these individuals can access educational opportunities equitably.
3. Cultural and historical context: Educators should incorporate the cultural and historical context of Native American recent immigrants into their teaching practices. This can involve exploring the histories and cultures of their communities of origin and how they have been impacted by colonization, migration, and other social and political factors.
4. Community partnerships: Educators should establish partnerships with community organizations and cultural centers that serve Native American recent immigrant populations. These partnerships can provide additional support services, such as tutoring, mentoring, and cultural activities, to help students succeed in school.
5. Inclusive curriculum: Educators should incorporate inclusive and diverse perspectives into their curriculum design. This can involve using texts and other materials that reflect the experiences and cultures of Native American recent immigrants and promoting critical thinking and dialogue about social justice issues affecting these communities.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Educators and policymakers should advocate for policies and practices that support the educational success of Native American recent immigrants. This can involve pushing for more funding for language support services, cultural programs, and other initiatives that promote equity and inclusivity in education.
7. Capacity building: Educators and policymakers should engage in ongoing professional development to build their capacity to support Native American recent immigrants.
