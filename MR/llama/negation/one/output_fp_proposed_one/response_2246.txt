Ensuring that the healthcare needs of beginner non-Arabic speaker middle-class people are met can be a challenge, especially in countries where Arabic is the primary language spoken. However, there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Provide multilingual healthcare services: Healthcare providers can offer medical consultations and services in multiple languages, including English, to cater to non-Arabic speakers. This can include providing interpretation services during medical appointments or offering written materials in various languages.
2. Use technology to facilitate communication: Telemedicine platforms and mobile apps can be used to connect patients with healthcare providers remotely, eliminating the need for in-person consultations. This can be particularly helpful for non-Arabic speakers who may find it difficult to communicate in person.
3. Offer cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers: Healthcare providers can receive training on how to communicate with patients from diverse backgrounds, including non-Arabic speakers. This can help ensure that patients feel comfortable and respected during medical appointments.
4. Encourage patient involvement in care: Patients who are unable to communicate in Arabic can still play an active role in their healthcare by bringing a family member or friend along to medical appointments for support. They can also use mobile apps or other tools to track their health and medication regimens.
5. Create multilingual resources: Healthcare providers can develop patient education materials, such as brochures or videos, in multiple languages to help non-Arabic speakers understand their health conditions and treatment options.
6. Partner with community organizations: Healthcare providers can collaborate with local community organizations that cater to non-Arabic speaking populations, such as language schools or cultural centers. These partnerships can help increase access to healthcare services for this group.
7. Offer interpreter services: Healthcare providers can hire professional interpreters who are fluent in multiple languages to assist with medical consultations and procedures. This can help ensure that non-Arabic speakers receive accurate and culturally sensitive care.
8. Use remote monitoring technology: Remote monitoring technologies, such as wearable devices or mobile apps, can be used to track patients' vital signs and health
