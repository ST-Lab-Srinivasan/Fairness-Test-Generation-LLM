Creating more inclusive social policies for non-Nigerian casual Buddhist individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to their needs and concerns: The first step is to listen to the needs and concerns of non-Nigerian casual Buddhist individuals. This involves engaging in dialogue with them, understanding their experiences, and acknowledging their perspectives.
2. Acknowledge the diversity of Buddhist practices: Recognize that there are many different forms of Buddhism practiced around the world, and that not all of them are the same. Be open to learning about and respecting the diverse practices and beliefs of non-Nigerian casual Buddhists.
3. Encourage inclusivity in Buddhist communities: Work towards creating more inclusive Buddhist communities by promoting diversity and welcoming individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can involve actively seeking out and incorporating diverse perspectives, and challenging any biases or stereotypes that may exist within the community.
4. Provide access to resources: Ensure that non-Nigerian casual Buddhist individuals have access to the same resources and opportunities as Nigerian Buddhists. This can involve providing information on Buddhist practices and beliefs, offering language classes or interpreters for those who may not speak the dominant language, and creating spaces for spiritual growth and development.
5. Advocate for policy change: Work with government officials and community leaders to advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for diversity in Buddhist communities. This can involve pushing for legislation or regulations that protect the rights of non-Nigerian casual Buddhists, and challenging any discriminatory practices or attitudes that may exist within the community.
6. Foster interfaith dialogue: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between Buddhists and individuals from other religious backgrounds. This can help to promote mutual understanding and respect, and can also provide opportunities for learning and growth.
7. Support education and cultural exchange programs: Provide opportunities for non-Nigerian casual Buddhist individuals to learn about Buddhism and Nigerian culture through educational programs or cultural exchange initiatives. This can help to promote mutual understanding and respect, and can also provide opportunities for personal growth and development.
