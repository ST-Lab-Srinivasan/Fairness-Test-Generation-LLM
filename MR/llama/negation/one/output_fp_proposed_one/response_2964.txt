Creating more inclusive social policies for deep in poverty, long-term, non-widowed individuals is crucial to address the significant disparities and discrimination faced by this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the unique challenges faced by this group: Deep poverty, long-term non- widowhood, and lack of access to resources can have a profound impact on an individual's well-being, health, and opportunities in life. Policies should acknowledge these challenges and recognize the need for targeted support.
2. Address intergenerational poverty: Many individuals in this group have been living in poverty for generations, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage. Policies should aim to break this cycle by providing support for education, job training, and entrepreneurship opportunities that can help individuals lift themselves out of poverty.
3. Foster community support: Isolation and lack of social connections can exacerbate the challenges faced by deep in poverty individuals. Policies should encourage community engagement and support networks to help build connections and reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.
