Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American non-citizen moderate individuals in the United States. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, beliefs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society. For Native Americans, their cultural heritage is deeply rooted in their history, language, religion, and traditional ways of life.

Native American non-citizen moderate individuals often have a complex identity that is shaped by their cultural heritage, as well as their experiences with colonialism, forced assimilation, and marginalization. They may identify with multiple cultures and identities, including their Native American heritage, American citizenship, and any other identities they may hold.

The cultural heritage of Native Americans is rich and diverse, with over 500 distinct tribes and nations across North America. Each tribe has its own unique traditions, beliefs, and practices, which are shaped by their history, geography, and interactions with other cultures. For example, the Navajo people have a strong tradition of storytelling and weaving, while the Cherokee people are known for their advanced agricultural practices and written language.

However, the cultural heritage of Native Americans has been significantly impacted by colonialism and forced assimilation. Many Native American communities were displaced from their ancestral lands, had their children taken away to boarding schools where they were forced to abandon their traditional ways of life, and were subjected to violence, discrimination, and marginalization. These experiences have contributed to a sense of loss and erasure of cultural identity among many Native Americans.

Despite these challenges, Native American non-citizen moderate individuals continue to assert their cultural heritage and identity. They may do this through cultural expression, such as music, art, or dance, or through political activism and advocacy for Indigenous rights. Many Native Americans also engage in language revitalization efforts to preserve their traditional languages and cultural practices.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American non-citizen moderate individuals. Their complex identity is shaped by their cultural heritage, as well as their experiences with colonialism, forced assimilation, and marginalization. Despite
