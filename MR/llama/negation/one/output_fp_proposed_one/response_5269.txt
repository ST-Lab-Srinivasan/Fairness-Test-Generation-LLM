The impact of disability status on the lives of long-term, recently non-undocumented, and happily long-time married people can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Isolationation: People with disabilities may face social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or limited access to social activities and events. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
2. Economic Challenges: Disability can impact a person's ability to work, leading to financial strain and reduced economic security. This can be particularly challenging for long-term married couples who may rely on a single income source.
3. Lack of Accessibility: Inaccessible buildings, transportation, and public spaces can limit the opportunities for people with disabilities to participate in society. This can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and hopelessness.
4. Stigma and Discrimination: People with disabilities may face stigma and discrimination from family members, healthcare providers, and society at large. This can lead to lower self-esteem, poor mental health outcomes, and reduced social participation.
5. Health Inequalities: Disability can result in increased morbidity and mortality rates, particularly among marginalized populations such as those living in poverty or experiencing discrimination.
6. Limited Access to Healthcare: People with disabilities may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to physical or attitudinal barriers, leading to delayed diagnosis, treatment, and management of conditions.
7. Caregiving Responsibilities: Spouses or partners of people with disabilities may take on caregiving responsibilities, which can lead to increased stress, burnout, and reduced well-being for both parties.
8. Limited Social Support: People with disabilities may experience limited social support from family members, friends, or community groups due to stigma, discrimination, or lack of understanding about their needs.
9. Identity Issues: Disability can impact a person's sense of identity, self-esteem, and body image, particularly if they are constantly reminded of their disability through societal messages, media representation, or personal experiences.
