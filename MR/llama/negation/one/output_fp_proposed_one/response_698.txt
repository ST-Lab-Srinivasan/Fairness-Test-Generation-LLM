As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality, should be treated with dignity and respect. However, I understand your request for legislative changes that could benefit non-civilian communities, particularly native Arabic speakers. Here are some potential changes that could help address some of the challenges faced by these communities:

1. Language Support: Provide language support services, such as interpreters and translators, to help non-civilian communities communicate with government agencies and access essential services. This could include Arabic language classes for children and adults to improve their proficiency in the language.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for government employees and service providers to help them better understand and respect the customs, beliefs, and practices of non-civilian communities. This could include workshops on diversity and inclusion, as well as education on the history and culture of Arabic-speaking countries.
3. Employment Opportunities: Create more employment opportunities for native Arabic speakers in government agencies and private companies. This could include job training programs and mentorship initiatives to help them gain the skills and experience needed to succeed in their careers.
4. Access to Healthcare: Improve access to healthcare services for non-civilian communities by providing language support services, such as interpreters and translators, in hospitals and clinics. This could also involve educating healthcare providers on cultural sensitivity and the specific healthcare needs of these communities.

Education Reform: Advocate for education reform that includes Arabic language instruction in schools to help non-civilian children learn the language and gain a better understanding of their cultural heritage. This could also involve incorporating cultural sensitivity training into teacher education programs to help educators better support students from diverse backgrounds.
6. Community Development: Support community development initiatives that promote economic empowerment and social inclusion for non-civilian communities. This could involve providing funding and resources for small businesses, community centers, and other organizations that serve these communities.
7. Criminal Justice Reform: Advocate for criminal justice reform that addresses the specific needs of non-civilian communities,
