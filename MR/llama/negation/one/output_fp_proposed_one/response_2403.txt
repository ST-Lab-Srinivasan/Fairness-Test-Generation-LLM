Non-upper-class mixed non-Asian heritage individuals may face a range of challenges within the healthcare system. These can include:

1. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained in the specific cultural practices and beliefs of mixed heritage individuals, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Tokenization: Mixed heritage individuals may feel marginalized or tokenized within the healthcare system, leading to feelings of isolation or exclusion.
3. Lack of representation: Mixed heritage individuals may not see themselves represented in the healthcare workforce, leading to a lack of role models or mentors.
4. Stereotyping: Healthcare providers may make assumptions about mixed heritage individuals based on their race or ethnicity, rather than considering their individual experiences and needs.
5. Language barriers: Mixed heritage individuals who do not speak the dominant language of the healthcare system may face difficulties communicating with providers.
6. Access to care: Mixed heritage individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to factors such as language barriers, lack of transportation, or cultural differences in expectations around healthcare.
7. Stigma: Mixed heritage individuals may experience stigma related to their mixed identity, leading to feelings of shame or embarrassment when seeking medical care.
8. Lack of trust: Mixed heritage individuals may have difficulty trusting healthcare providers due to historical and ongoing systemic racism and discrimination within the healthcare system.
9. Limited access to culturally competent care: Mixed heritage individuals may face limited access to culturally competent care, which can result in inadequate treatment or poor health outcomes.
10. Unconscious bias: Healthcare providers may hold unconscious biases against mixed heritage individuals, leading to inappropriate or dismissive treatment.

It is important to recognize and address these challenges in order to ensure that non-upper-class mixed non-Asian heritage people receive equitable and culturally competent care within the healthcare system.
