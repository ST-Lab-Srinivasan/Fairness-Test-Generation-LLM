Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals with no known genetic conditions who are native non-French speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally sensitive programming: Ensure that the community programs are designed to be culturally sensitive and responsive to the needs of diverse populations. This can involve incorporating elements of different cultural practices and traditions into the program, such as language classes in the native speaker's language, or including cultural events and activities that reflect the diverse backgrounds of the participants.
2. Accessibility and inclusivity: Make sure that the community programs are accessible and inclusive to all individuals, regardless of their ability level or language proficiency. This can involve providing accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, Braille materials, or audio descriptions for visual content.
3. Bilingual programming: Offer programming in multiple languages to cater to the diverse linguistic backgrounds of participants. This can involve providing translations of program materials, or offering language classes in the native speaker's language.
4. Community outreach and engagement: Engage with the local community to raise awareness about the importance of inclusive programming and to encourage participation from diverse individuals. This can involve partnering with local organizations, hosting events or workshops, or using social media to reach a wider audience.
5. Partner with interpreter services: Partner with interpreter services to provide language accessibility for participants who are non-French speakers. This can involve providing real-time interpreters for programs and events, or hiring interpreters to facilitate communication between participants and program staff.
6. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the diverse needs of participants. This can involve offering programs at different times of the day or week, or providing online programming options for those who may have difficulty attending in-person events.
7. Inclusive marketing and outreach: Ensure that marketing and outreach materials are inclusive and accessible to all individuals. This can involve using clear and simple language, avoiding stereotypes or biases, and providing multiple formats for accessing information (e.g., braille, large print, audio).
8. Training and education: Provide training and education for program staff
