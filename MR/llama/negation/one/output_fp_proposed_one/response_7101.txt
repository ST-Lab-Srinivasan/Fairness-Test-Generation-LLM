Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native non-Chinese speaker ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and engage with the community: Hold community meetings, surveys, or focus groups to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. Engage with local organizations and community leaders to gather insights and build trust.
2. Involve diverse stakeholders: Collaborate with a diversity of stakeholders, including ethnically full Asian individuals, to co-create cultural programs that reflect their perspectives and experiences. This could involve working with artists, curators, educators, and community leaders from different Asian backgrounds.
3. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Develop cultural programs that promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. This could involve organizing events that showcase the arts, traditions, and histories of diverse Asian communities.
4. Provide accessible programming: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to a wide range of audiences, including those who may not be fluent in Chinese. Offer translated materials, interpretation services, or bilingual programming to make the content more inclusive.
5. Address marginalization and representation: Be mindful of the historical and systemic marginalization of certain Asian communities. Ensure that cultural programs represent and celebrate the diversity of Asian experiences, including those of ethnically full Asian individuals.
6. Prioritize community involvement: Involve the community in every stage of program development, from conceptualization to implementation. This could involve collaborating with local artists, performers, or cultural organizations to create culturally relevant content.
7. Promote intergenerational dialogue: Encourage intergenerational dialogue and storytelling within Asian communities. This could involve organizing events that bring together older and younger generations to share their experiences, traditions, and stories.
8. Foster partnerships: Build partnerships with other organizations, institutions, or businesses that can help amplify the cultural programs' reach and impact. Collaborate with organizations that specialize in Asian cultural programming to leverage existing expertise and resources.
9. Provide educational opportunities: Offer educational opportunities, such as workshops, lectures, or classes
