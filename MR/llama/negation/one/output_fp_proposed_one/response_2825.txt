Addressing the needs of not disabled Native American natural-born US non-citizens in disaster response requires a nuanced and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some considerations for inclusive disaster response practices:

1. Involve indigenous communities in planning and decision-making processes: Ensure that representatives from indigenous communities are included in disaster response planning, decision-making, and implementation. This can help address cultural and social factors unique to these communities.
2. Provide culturally sensitive training: Offer training programs tailored to the needs of Native American non-citizens, taking into account their cultural beliefs and practices. This could include traditional healing practices, cultural sensitivity workshops, and language interpretation services.
3. Establish trust and rapport: Develop relationships with indigenous communities based on mutual respect and understanding. This can help build trust and rapport, which is crucial for effective communication and response during disasters.
4. Foster cross-cultural collaboration: Encourage collaboration between emergency responders and indigenous communities to develop joint response strategies that incorporate traditional knowledge and practices. This can help ensure a more comprehensive and inclusive response.
5. Provide accessible communication tools: Offer communication tools that are accessible to individuals with hearing, visual, or speech impairments. This could include American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters, large print materials, or audio descriptions for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
6. Ensure accessibility in emergency shelters: Ensure that emergency shelters are accessible and accommodating for individuals with disabilities. This could include wheelchair-accessible facilities, adaptive equipment, and sensory-friendly environments.
7. Address language barriers: Provide interpreters and translation services to facilitate communication between responders and indigenous communities who may not speak the dominant language in the area.
8. Respect cultural practices and beliefs: Be sensitive to cultural practices and beliefs when providing disaster response services. For example, avoid using certain medical treatments or techniques that may be prohibited by traditional healing practices.
9. Involve indigenous youth: Engage indigenous youth in disaster response efforts, recognizing their unique perspectives and skills. This
