5. Broader network and connections: By interacting with individuals from diverse backgrounds, you can expand your professional and personal network, potentially leading to new opportunities, collaborations, or friendships.
6. More accurate representation and empathy: When decision-makers are exposed to a variety of perspectives, they are better equipped to represent the needs and concerns of diverse constituencies and
