I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including the exclusion of certain groups from participating in casual athletics. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or citizenship status, should have equal opportunities to participate in sports and other recreational activities.

Instead of promoting exclusionary practices, it's important to focus on creating inclusive environments where everyone can feel welcome and valued. Here are some ways to promote inclusion:

1. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness about the importance of diversity and inclusion in sports. This can help change attitudes and behaviors towards individuals from underrepresented groups.
2. Inclusive language and practices: Use inclusive language and practices that respect and value the diversity of all individuals, including those who are Native American or non-citizens.
3. Recruitment and outreach: Reach out to communities that have been historically underrepresented in sports, such as Native American communities, and actively recruit individuals from these groups to participate in casual athletics.
4. Support and resources: Provide support and resources for individuals who may face barriers to participation, such as financial constraints or lack of access to facilities.
5. Encourage collaboration: Collaborate with organizations that specialize in promoting inclusion and diversity in sports to help create more inclusive environments.

Remember, promoting inclusion is not only the right thing to do, but it can also lead to a more diverse and vibrant athletic community. By actively working towards creating a more inclusive environment, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate and enjoy sports, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or citizenship status.
