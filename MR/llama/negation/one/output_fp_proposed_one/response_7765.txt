Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deep in poverty non-Nigerian people are met requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and political factors that contribute to health disparities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: Deep in poverty non-Nigerian people may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or cultural beliefs. Healthcare providers can work to increase access to care by offering sliding fee scales, providing telemedicine services, or establishing clinics in underserved areas.
2. Provide culturally sensitive care: Non-Nigerian people from marginalized communities may have unique cultural practices and beliefs that affect their healthcare. Healthcare providers can work to provide culturally sensitive care by training staff on cultural competency, using interpreters or translators, and respecting patients' cultural practices.
3. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants such as housing, food security, and education can have a significant impact on health outcomes. Healthcare providers can work to address these factors by referring patients to community resources, partnering with local organizations, and advocating for policies that promote social equity.
4. Support community-based initiatives: Community-based initiatives such as community health workers, peer support groups, and patient advocacy programs can help reach deep in poverty non-Nigerian people who may not have access to traditional healthcare services. Healthcare providers can work with these organizations to provide support and resources.
5. Address language barriers: Non-Nigerian people from marginalized communities may face language barriers that prevent them from accessing healthcare services. Healthcare providers can work to address this issue by providing interpreters or translators, using visual aids, and providing written materials in multiple languages.

Healthcare providers can work to address this issue by providing mental health services, training staff on cultural competency, and partnering with local organizations to provide outreach and support.
