1. Early Childhood Education Programs: Implementing early childhood education programs that cater to the unique needs of infants and toddlers can help bridge the gap in their educational attainment. These programs should be designed to promote cognitive, social, and emotional development through play-based learning, creative activities, and interactive experiences.
