Creating more inclusive community events for beginner non-Arabic speaker upper middle-class people can be achieved through a variety of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to everyone, regardless of their language proficiency. Provide translations or interpretation services, or offer bilingual staff to help participants navigate the event.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and avoid assumptions about people based on their cultural background. Offer a diverse range of activities and events that cater to different interests and preferences.
3. Inclusive marketing: Advertise the event in multiple languages and formats, including social media, flyers, posters, and email campaigns. Use inclusive language and imagery in your marketing materials to ensure that everyone feels welcome.

5. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for people to get involved in organizing or running the event. This can help build a sense of ownership and community involvement, especially among those who may not be fluent in Arabic.
6. Interactive activities: Plan interactive activities that are inclusive and accessible to everyone, such as art workshops, music performances, or cultural dance classes. This can help break down language barriers and create a sense of shared experience.
7. Food and drink: Offer a diverse range of food and drink options that cater to different tastes and dietary restrictions. This can help create a welcoming atmosphere and ensure that everyone feels included.
8. Accessibility features: Ensure that the event space is accessible to people with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
9. Language support: Provide language support services, such as translators or interpreters, to help participants communicate effectively during the event.
10. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable in your planning to accommodate different needs and preferences. Be willing to adjust activities or events based on feedback from attendees to ensure that everyone feels included and valued.
