Creating more inclusive social policies for lifelong single non-permanent residents (LNSPRs) is crucial to ensure that they are not left behind in the social and economic landscape. Here are some ways to create more inclusive social policies for LNSPRs:

1. Address discrimination: One of the main reasons why LNSPRs face exclusion is discrimination based on their immigration status. Policies should be designed to address this issue by promoting equal treatment and opportunities for all, regardless of immigration status.
2. Access to education and training: Providing access to education and training programs can help LNSPRs acquire new skills and knowledge that can enhance their employability and social mobility. This can include language classes, vocational training, and academic programs.
3. Employment opportunities: Policies should aim to create more job opportunities for LNSPRs, particularly in sectors where they are underrepresented. This can be achieved by providing support for entrepreneurship and small businesses, and by promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
4. Healthcare access: Ensuring access to affordable healthcare is essential for LNSPRs, who may face barriers in accessing medical care due to their immigration status. Policies should aim to provide accessible and inclusive healthcare services that cater to the needs of this population.
5. Housing support: Many LNSPRs struggle with housing insecurity due to lack of access to affordable and secure housing options. Policies should aim to provide stable and affordable housing options, including rent control and subsidies for low-income households.
6. Social safety nets: Policies should aim to provide a comprehensive social safety net that addresses the basic needs of LNSPRs, including food security, clothing, and other essential services. This can be achieved by providing financial assistance, food banks, and other forms of support.
7. Community engagement: Encouraging community engagement and participation can help build bridges between different communities and promote social cohesion. Policies should aim to foster dialogue and collaboration between LNSPRs and the broader society.
8. Advocacy and awareness-raising: Raising awareness
