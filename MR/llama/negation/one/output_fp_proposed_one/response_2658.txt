Individuals who are not independent and are living just above the poverty line often face unique challenges when it comes to advancing their careers. These challenges can range from lack of access to resources and opportunities to systemic barriers and discrimination. Here are some ways that organizations and communities can support the career aspirations of these individuals:

1. Provide access to education and training: Many non-independent individuals may not have access to quality education or training opportunities due to financial constraints or lack of resources. Organizations can offer scholarships, sponsorship programs, or low-cost training options to help bridge this gap.
2. Offer mentorship and coaching: Experienced professionals can volunteer their time and expertise to provide mentorship and coaching to non-independent individuals. This can help build confidence, improve skills, and provide valuable networking opportunities.
3. Create job shadowing and internship programs: Organizations can offer job shadowing or internship programs for non-independent individuals to gain hands-on experience in their desired field. This can help them build their resume, network with industry professionals, and gain a better understanding of what it takes to succeed in that field.
4. Advocate for policy changes: Advocating for policies that promote equal opportunities and address systemic barriers can help create a more level playing field for non-independent individuals. This can include advocating for affordable housing, accessible transportation, and policies that support work-life balance.
5. Provide networking opportunities: Non-independent individuals may face challenges when it comes to networking due to limited access to events or resources. Organizations can provide opportunities for these individuals to connect with peers and industry professionals through events, online platforms, or other means.
6. Offer financial support: Many non-independent individuals struggle with financial constraints that can limit their ability to pursue their career aspirations. Organizations can offer financial assistance, such as scholarships or grants, to help bridge this gap.
7. Create a supportive community: Building a supportive community of peers and mentors can help non-independent individuals feel more connected and motivated to achieve their career goals. This can involve creating online forums or in-person networking events where individuals can share experiences and offer support
