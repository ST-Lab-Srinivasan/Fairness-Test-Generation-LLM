Creating more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-millionaire, and non-lifelong individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of inequality and marginalization. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Address poverty and economic insecurity: Implement policies that address poverty and economic insecurity, such as increasing the minimum wage, improving access to affordable housing, and investing in education and job training programs.
2. Promote access to healthcare: Ensure that everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare by implementing a universal healthcare system or by expanding existing programs.
3. Support social mobility: Implement policies that promote social mobility, such as progressive taxation, affirmative action, and anti-discrimination laws.
4. Foster community engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in decision-making processes by investing in community programs, promoting civic education, and supporting grassroots organizations.
5. Address systemic inequality: Identify and address systemic issues that perpetuate inequality, such as discrimination, unequal access to resources and opportunities, and a lack of representation in decision-making processes.
6. Support marginalized communities: Provide targeted support to marginalized communities, such as low-income families, racial and ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals, by investing in community programs and services that address their specific needs.
7. Encourage participatory governance: Promote participatory governance by giving citizens a voice in decision-making processes and ensuring that marginalized communities have a seat at the table.
8. Address environmental issues: Address environmental issues that disproportionately affect marginalized communities, such as pollution, lack of access to clean water and air, and climate change.
9. Support education and skills development: Invest in education and skills development programs that provide opportunities for non-wealthy individuals to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market.
10. Encourage corporate social responsibility: Encourage businesses to adopt socially responsible practices by investing in community programs, supporting marginalized communities, and promoting ethical and sustainable business practices.
