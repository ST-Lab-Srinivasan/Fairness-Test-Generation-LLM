Creating more inclusive community programs for non-civilian long-term widowed individuals requires understanding their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive programs:

1. Listen to their stories: Hold listening sessions or workshops where widows can share their experiences, grief, and struggles. This will help you understand their needs and tailor the program accordingly.
2. Identify their challenges: Widows face various challenges such as social isolation, financial difficulties, and emotional distress. Develop programs that address these challenges directly or indirectly.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming environment where widows feel included and valued. This can be done by promoting intergenerational connections, cultural activities, and community service projects.
4. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance, such as scholarships or small business loans, to help widows who are struggling financially.
5. Offer mental health support: Provide access to mental health professionals or counseling services to help widows manage their grief and emotional well-being.
6. Create age-appropriate activities: Develop programs that cater to the interests and abilities of widows at different stages of life. For example, younger widows may enjoy fitness classes or art therapy, while older widows may prefer book clubs or gardening groups.
7. Involve the community: Collaborate with local organizations, churches, and businesses to create a network of support for widows. This can include offering community events, workshops, or volunteer opportunities.
8. Provide practical help: Offer practical assistance such as grocery shopping, housekeeping, or transportation services to help widows manage their daily tasks and improve their quality of life.
9. Celebrate their contributions: Recognize the valuable contributions that widows make to their communities, whether through volunteer work, caregiving, or other means. This can be done by hosting events or creating awards that highlight their achievements.
10. Monitor and evaluate progress: Regularly assess the effectiveness of your programs and make adjustments as needed. Solicit feedback from widows to ensure that their needs are being met and their voices are being heard.
