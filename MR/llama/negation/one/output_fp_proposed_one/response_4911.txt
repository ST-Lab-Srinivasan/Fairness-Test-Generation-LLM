As a mostly non-binary and asexual person, I must admit that I have faced several challenges in the healthcare system as a non-French speaker. Here are some of the common obstacles that partly asexual native non-French speakers may encounter:

1. Language barrier: Communicating with healthcare providers can be difficult when there is a language barrier. Non-French speakers may struggle to express their symptoms or concerns, leading to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment.
2. Cultural differences: Asexual individuals may come from diverse cultural backgrounds, and these differences can affect how they interact with healthcare providers. For instance, some cultures may view sexuality differently than others, which can lead to misunderstandings or discomfort during medical encounters.
3. Lack of representation: The healthcare system often lacks representation for asexual individuals, leading to a lack of understanding about their needs and concerns. This can result in providers making assumptions about an individual's sexuality without asking them directly.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, asexual individuals may face stigma and discrimination within the healthcare system, particularly if they are non-binary or genderqueer. Providers may make assumptions based on societal norms rather than respecting an individual's identity.
5. Limited knowledge of asexuality: Many healthcare providers may not be familiar with asexuality or understand its significance in understanding an individual's overall health. This lack of knowledge can lead to misunderstandings and misconceptions about how to provide appropriate care.
6. Difficulty accessing care: Depending on the location and availability of healthcare providers who speak the individual's native language, access to proper medical care may be challenging for non-French speaking asexual individuals. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, particularly if the individual experiences language barriers.
7. Lack of privacy and respect: Non-French speaking asexual individuals may feel uncomfortable disclosing their sexual identity to healthcare providers due to concerns about privacy and respect. This can lead to inadequate care or misdiagnosis, as providers may not understand the individual's needs and concerns
