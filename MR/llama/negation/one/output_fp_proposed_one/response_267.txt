Supporting native natural-born US non-citizen communities during the third trimester of pregnancy can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be effective. Here are some options to consider:

1. Cultural Humility and Sensitivity: Recognize and respect the cultural practices and beliefs of the community. Be sensitive to their language, customs, and traditions. Avoid imposing your own cultural beliefs and values on them, and instead, learn from them.
2. Education and Resource Sharing: Provide access to educational resources and materials that can help the community understand the importance of proper prenatal care, nutrition, and hygiene during pregnancy. Offer workshops or classes on these topics, and provide resource guides or pamphlets in their native language.
3. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that the community has access to quality healthcare providers who speak their native language and are culturally sensitive. Provide transportation or translation services if needed.
4. Community Outreach and Engagement: Build relationships with local leaders and community members to understand their needs and concerns.

5. Collaboration with Other Agencies: Work with other agencies or organizations that provide services to immigrant and refugee communities, such as health clinics, social service agencies, or community centers. Share resources and expertise to better serve the community.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies that support the needs of immigrant and refugee communities during pregnancy and childbirth. Work with local and national policymakers to address systemic barriers and improve access to healthcare services.

8. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that healthcare facilities are accessible and welcoming to the community. Provide wheelchairs or interpreters if needed, and make sure that waiting rooms are stocked with
