Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US who are not in a relationship requires a nuanced and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some strategies that can be used in education:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American recent immigrants may have experienced trauma, loss of identity, and cultural disruption due to their migration to the US. Educators must adopt culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge and respect their cultural backgrounds. This includes incorporating traditional Native American teachings, stories, and values into lessons and activities.
2. Language support: Many Native American recent immigrants may face language barriers due to the absence of fluent speakers in their communities or because they have not had access to language education programs. Educators can provide language support through bilingual or multilingual instruction, language translation services, or partnerships with language schools.
3. Cultural brokering: Native American recent immigrants may face discrimination and marginalization in their new communities due to cultural differences. Educators can serve as cultural brokers by facilitating dialogue between students' cultural groups and the broader community, promoting cross-cultural understanding, and advocating for inclusive policies.
4. Mentorship programs: Pairing Native American recent immigrants with mentors from their own cultural background can provide emotional support, cultural guidance, and academic advice. Mentors can help students navigate the education system, build connections with peers and educators, and develop a sense of belonging.
5. Culturally relevant curriculum: The curriculum should be designed to reflect the experiences, histories, and perspectives of Native American recent immigrants. This includes incorporating Indigenous knowledge systems, cultural practices, and traditional arts into lessons. By doing so, students can see themselves reflected in their education and feel more connected to their heritage.
6. Community partnerships: Collaborating with local Indigenous organizations, community groups, and tribal governments can provide Native American recent immigrants with access to culturally appropriate services, resources, and support. Educators can also engage in reciprocal learning with these partners, sharing knowledge and practices to enhance their teaching practices.
7. Advocacy and policy change
