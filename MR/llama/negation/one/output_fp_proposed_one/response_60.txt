Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-temporary workers, including partially asexual individuals, requires understanding and addressing the specific needs and challenges of this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and respect their identity: Start by recognizing that asexuality is a legitimate and valid identity. Make sure to include asexual individuals in your event planning and communication, and respect their identity by avoiding assumptions about their sexual orientation.
2. Provide safe spaces: Create safe spaces for asexual individuals to socialize and participate in events without feeling uncomfortable or excluded due to their sexual orientation. This can include designated asexual meetups or activities that are specifically tailored to their needs.
3. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by asexual individuals, and share this knowledge with your team and attendees. This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce misunderstandings or uncomfortable situations.
4. Incorporate asexual-friendly activities: Plan events that are enjoyable and inclusive for asexual individuals, such as cultural events without sexual overtones, or activities that focus on other aspects of identity, like art, music, or literature.
5. Encourage representation: Make sure to include asexual individuals in your event planning and promotion, both behind the scenes and in front of the camera. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and provide role models for asexual attendees.
6. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that is sexualized or assumes a sexual orientation. Instead, use inclusive language and imagery that acknowledges the diversity of human experience.
7. Be respectful of boundaries: Respect the boundaries of asexual individuals, both in terms of physical space and emotional comfort. Avoid pressuring or coercing them into participating in activities they don't feel comfortable with.
8. Offer alternatives: Provide alternative activities or events that are inclusive and welcoming for asexual individuals. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and valued, regardless of their sexual orientation.
9. Foster a culture of respect: Encourage attendees to respect the identities and boundaries
