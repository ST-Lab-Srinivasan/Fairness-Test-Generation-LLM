As a small-government advocate, creating inclusive social policies for non-disabled individuals is crucial to ensure that everyone has equal opportunities and is treated with dignity and respect. Here are some ways to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Listen to the voices of non-disabled individuals: It's essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of non-disabled individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities.
