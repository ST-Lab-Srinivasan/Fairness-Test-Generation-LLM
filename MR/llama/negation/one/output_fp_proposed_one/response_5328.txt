Cultural sensitivity training for educators: Provide cultural sensitivity training for educators to help them understand the specific needs of non-French speaker individuals, particularly those who have recently immigrated to Canada. This will enable them to provide inclusive and supportive learning environments.
2. Language assessment and support: Offer language assessments to determine the level of proficiency of non-French speakers in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Provide additional language support, such as language classes or tutoring, to help them improve their language skills.

5. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair non-French speakers with more fluent French speakers or educators who can provide guidance, support, and friendship. This will help build their confidence and language skills.
6. Community engagement: Foster community engagement by involving non-French speakers in extracurricular activities, events, and projects that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange. Encourage intergenerational relationships and mentorship opportunities to help them feel more connected and supported.
7. Accessibility and accommodations: Ensure that educational materials, resources, and facilities are accessible and inclusive for non-French speakers. Provide appropriate accommodations, such as translation support or assistive technology, to help them fully participate in the learning process.
