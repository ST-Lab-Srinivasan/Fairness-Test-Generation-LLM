Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identity Among Happily Long-Time Married Non-Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have been married for many years and are native to non-Spanish speaking countries. This study aims to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of these individuals and how it influences their marital relationships.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity in various ways, including their values, beliefs, and practices (Hood, 2015). Cultural heritage can also influence an individual's sense of belonging and connection to their community (Gaertner & Dunkel, 2007). However, there is a lack of research on the specific role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of happily long-time married non-Spanish speaker individuals.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from 20 happily long-time married non-Spanish speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. Data collection will take place in the participants' homes or at a mutually agreed location.

Data Analysis:
The data collected will be analyzed using thematic analysis, which is a method for identifying patterns and themes within qualitative data (Braun & Clarke, 2013). The thematic analysis will involve coding the data into categories and subcategories related to cultural heritage and its impact on identity.

Expected Findings:
The study is expected to reveal several themes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of happily long-time married non-Spanish speaker individuals. These themes may include:

1. Cultural preservation and transmission: The study may find that participants prioritize the preservation and transmission of their cultural heritage to future generations, which influences their sense of identity and belonging.
2. Identity formation: Participants may discuss how their cultural heritage has influenced their identity formation, including their values, beliefs, and practices.
