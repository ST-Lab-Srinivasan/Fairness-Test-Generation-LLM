Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled Native recent immigrants to the US requires a deliberate and multifaceted approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to and center their voices: Non-disabled Native recent immigrants often face unique challenges that are not addressed by existing policies. Listening to their experiences and perspectives can help inform policy decisions that are tailored to their needs.
2. Address systemic barriers: Non-disabled Native recent immigrants may face systemic barriers such as discrimination, language barriers, and cultural differences. Policies should aim to address these barriers and create more inclusive environments.
3. Provide accessible healthcare: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and culturally competent for non-disabled Native recent immigrants. This can include providing interpreters and translators, as well as cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers.
4. Promote economic empowerment: Non-disabled Native recent immigrants may face employment discrimination and limited access to financial resources. Policies should aim to promote economic empowerment through job training programs, microfinance initiatives, and other forms of support.
5. Foster inclusive communities: Create more inclusive communities by promoting cultural understanding and respect. This can involve providing education and outreach programs that foster cross-cultural dialogue and collaboration.
6. Address language barriers: Non-disabled Native recent immigrants may face language barriers that hinder their access to services and opportunities. Policies should aim to address this through language support services, such as interpretation and translation.
7. Provide disability benefits: Ensure that non-disabled Native recent immigrants have access to disability benefits that address their specific needs. This can include providing information on available resources, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid, as well as assistance with applications and appeals.
8. Support mental health: Non-disabled Native recent immigrants may face unique mental health challenges due to cultural and linguistic barriers, trauma, and discrimination. Policies should aim to provide accessible mental health services that are culturally competent and tailored to their needs.
