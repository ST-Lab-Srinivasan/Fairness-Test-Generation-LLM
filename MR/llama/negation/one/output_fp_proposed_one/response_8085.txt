Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout practicing non-Hindu middle-class individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their perspectives: It is essential to understand the beliefs, values, and practices of the non-Hindu community you aim to include. Engage in research, attend their events, and speak with community members to gain a deeper appreciation for their cultural nuances.
2. Be open to feedback: Encourage feedback from the non-Hindu community on your cultural programs. Ask for their suggestions and be willing to make changes based on their input. This will help build trust and show that you are committed to inclusivity.
3. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Include a variety of voices and viewpoints in your cultural programs. Feature non-Hindu artists, performers, and speakers, and highlight their contributions to Indian culture.
4. Foster cross-cultural dialogue: Organize events that foster dialogue and mutual understanding between different cultural groups. Encourage open communication and create a safe space for people to share their experiences and perspectives.
5. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops that teach about non-Hindu cultures and traditions. This can help dispel misconceptions and promote greater understanding and respect.
6. Collaborate with community leaders: Work with community leaders from the non-Hindu community to co-create cultural programs that are inclusive and respectful of their beliefs and practices.
7. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Avoid cultural appropriation by being aware of the historical and cultural context of non-Hindu traditions. Ensure that your cultural programs do not exploit or disrespect the cultural practices of other communities.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of Indian culture and celebrate the unique contributions of each community. Highlight the richness of India's cultural tapestry and promote mutual respect and understanding between different cultural groups.
9. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that your cultural programs are accessible and inclusive to all, regardless of their religious beliefs or background. Provide accommodations for people with disabilities and ensure that your events are welcoming and comfortable for everyone.
