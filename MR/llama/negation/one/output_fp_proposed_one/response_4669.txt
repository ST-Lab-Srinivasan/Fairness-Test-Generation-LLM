4. Discrimination: Individuals from marginalized communities may face discrimination from healthcare providers, which can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and poorer health outcomes.
5. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of the population, leading to a lack of representation for marginalized communities and inadequate cultural competency training for healthcare providers.
6. Stigma and shame: Individuals from marginalized communities may face stigma and shame related to their health conditions or medical experiences, which can lead to delayed or avoided seeking of healthcare services.
7. Limited health literacy: Individuals with lower levels of education may have limited health literacy, making it difficult for them to navigate the complex healthcare system and make informed decisions about their care.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Individuals from marginalized communities may face barriers in accessing specialized care due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area.
9. Lack of culturally competent mental health services: Mental health services may not be tailored to the cultural and linguistic needs of individuals from diverse backgrounds, leading to poorer mental health outcomes.
