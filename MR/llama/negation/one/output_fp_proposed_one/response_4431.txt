Non-temporary workers, particularly those who have been employed for an extended period of time, may face unique challenges within the legal system. Some of the challenges they may encounter include:

1. Lack of legal protection: Unlike temporary workers who are protected by labor laws, non-temporary workers may not have the same legal protections. This can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights or seek redress if they experience unfair treatment in the workplace.
