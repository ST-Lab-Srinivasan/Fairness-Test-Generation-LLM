Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term unemployed, happy non-married individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize the value of non-traditional family structures: Many non-married individuals have chosen not to enter into traditional marriage for various reasons, including personal beliefs, career goals, or simply not finding a compatible partner. These individuals deserve recognition and support for their choices, rather than facing discrimination or stigma.
2. Foster job training and placement programs: Long-term unemployment can have severe consequences on an individual's mental and financial well-being. Governments and organizations should invest in job training and placement programs that cater to the unique needs of non-traditional families, such as flexible work arrangements or childcare support.
3. Provide affordable housing options: Housing insecurity is a significant challenge for many non-married individuals, particularly those with children. Governments can offer affordable housing options, subsidies, or rental assistance programs to help mitigate this issue.
4. Encourage financial planning and savings: Many non-married individuals face unique financial challenges, such as limited access to employer-sponsored retirement plans or other benefits. Governments can offer financial planning resources, tax incentives, or other support to help these individuals save for the future.
5. Improve mental health services: Long-term unemployment can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health and well-being. Mental health services should be accessible and affordable for all, regardless of marital status.
6. Address systemic barriers: Non-married individuals may face discrimination or bias in various areas of life, such as education, employment, or healthcare. Governments can implement policies to address these systemic barriers and promote inclusivity.
7. Support community building: Non-traditional families often lack social support networks. Governments and organizations can invest in community programs that bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds, fostering a sense of belonging and support.
8. Advocate for policy change: Many existing policies and laws may unintentionally discriminate against non-married individuals.
