Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are ethnically full non-Caucasian individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Understand the diversity of the Arab world: Recognize that the Arab world is diverse, encompassing various cultures, languages, and customs. Acknowledge the richness of this diversity and avoid stereotyping or reducing the identity of non-Caucasian participants to a single culture or ethnicity.
2. Involve diverse voices: Ensure that the perspectives of beginner Arabic speakers from diverse backgrounds are represented in the development and implementation of cultural programs. This can be achieved by consulting with community leaders, activists, and artists who are familiar with the needs and preferences of their respective communities.
3. Offer culturally sensitive programming: Design cultural programs that are respectful and inclusive of the diverse backgrounds of beginner Arabic speakers. Avoid using stereotypical or offensive content, and ensure that the language used is accessible and appropriate for the target audience.
4. Provide interpreters and translators: Offer interpretive services during cultural events to ensure that participants who are non-Caucasian and may not speak fluent Arabic can fully engage with the program. Provide translation support to help beginners understand complex cultural practices and traditions.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where beginner Arabic speakers feel welcome and included. Encourage participants to share their experiences, traditions, and customs, and provide opportunities for them to connect with one another and build relationships.
6. Address power dynamics: Be mindful of the potential power imbalances that may exist between Caucasian and non-Caucasian participants. Ensure that beginner Arabic speakers are not marginalized or tokenized, and provide opportunities for them to take leadership roles and contribute their perspectives.
7. Offer adaptive resources: Provide accommodations and adaptive resources to support beginner Arabic speakers with disabilities or other accessibility needs. This can include sign language interpreters, audio describers, or braille materials.
8. Celebrate diversity:
