1. Representation on decision-making bodies: Ensure that there are representation of monastic non-Buddhist individuals on decision-making bodies such as boards, committees, and councils. This could be through direct election or appointment by a recognized authority.
2. Regular dialogue: Organize regular dialogue sessions between monastic non-Buddhist individuals and Buddhist leaders to ensure that their voices are heard and valued. These sessions could be held in person, virtually, or through written communication.
3. Inclusive decision-making processes: Develop decision-making processes that are inclusive of all perspectives, including those of monastic non-Buddhist individuals. This could involve brainstorming sessions, focus groups, or other forms of collaborative decision-making.
4. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness programs to promote understanding and appreciation of different religious beliefs and practices within the Buddhist community. This could help reduce misconceptions and biases towards monastic non-Buddhist individuals.
5. Support networks: Establish support networks for monastic non-Buddhist individuals, providing them with resources and mentorship to navigate the Buddhist community. These networks could include peer support groups or mentorship programs.
6. Advocacy and activism: Encourage advocacy and activism efforts by monastic non-Buddhist individuals to amplify their voices and push for greater representation and inclusion within the Buddhist community. This could involve campaigns for policy changes, public awareness initiatives, or other forms of advocacy.
