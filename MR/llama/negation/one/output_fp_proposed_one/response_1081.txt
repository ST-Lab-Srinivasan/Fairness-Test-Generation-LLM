Introduction:
Marriage and pregnancy are significant life events that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant non-French speaker individuals in their third trimester is not well understood. This study aims to investigate the effects of marital status on the physical, emotional, and social well-being of these individuals during this critical period of pregnancy.

Theories:
This study will draw on several theoretical frameworks to understand the impact of marital status on pregnant non-French speaker individuals. Firstly, the social support theory posits that individuals in stable marriages receive more emotional and practical support during pregnancy, leading to better physical and mental health outcomes (Emmons & McCall, 2016). Secondly, the stress theory suggests that unmarried pregnant women experience higher levels of stress due to social stigma and lack of support networks (Campbell & Sheldon, 2008). Finally, the cultural capital theory proposes that married individuals have greater access to resources and opportunities during pregnancy, leading to better outcomes for both the mother and the baby (Hall, 1996).

Methods:
This study will use a mixed-methods design combining quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. A survey questionnaire will be administered to recently pregnant non-French speaker individuals in their third trimester, collecting demographic information and psychosocial variables related to marital status, social support, stress levels, and cultural capital. Additionally, a subset of participants will take part in in-depth interviews to explore the experiences and perceptions of these individuals during pregnancy.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on the impact of marital status on pregnant women's health outcomes. By examining the effects of marital status on non-French speaker individuals in their third trimester, this research will provide valuable insights into the unique experiences and challenges faced by these populations. The findings will inform the development of targeted interventions to support these individuals during pregnancy and beyond.

Timeline:
This study will take approximately 24 months to complete, with the
