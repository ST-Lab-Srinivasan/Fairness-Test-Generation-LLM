5. Microaggressions: Non-native English speakers may experience microaggressions or subtle forms of discrimination based on their language proficiency or cultural background.
6. Lack of representation and role models: In some industries or organizations, non-native English speakers may have limited opportunities to see themselves represented in leadership positions or other roles that align with their interests and aspirations.
7. Difficulty finding mentorship and support: Non-native English speakers may find it challenging to find mentors or sponsors who can provide guidance and support in their professional development, particularly if they are not part of existing networks or communities.
8. Burnout and stress: The additional stresses of navigating a new cultural environment, managing language barriers, and dealing with unconscious bias can lead to burnout and stress for non-native English speakers.
