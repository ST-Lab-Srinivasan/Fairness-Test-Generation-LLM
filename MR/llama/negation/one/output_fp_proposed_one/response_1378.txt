High earners who are not Buddhists often have a strong support system within their families, which can play a significant role in their success. Here are some ways that family support can contribute to the success of these individuals:

1. Emotional Support: Having a close-knit family can provide emotional support during challenging times, such as when facing career setbacks or personal struggles. This support can help high earners stay motivated and focused on their goals.
2. Financial Support: Families of high earners may be able to provide financial assistance during periods of economic instability or when taking risks in their careers. This support can help individuals weather financial storms and take calculated risks that lead to greater success.
3. Networking Opportunities: Family members may have connections within their industries or networks that can benefit high earners in their career advancement. These connections can lead to new opportunities, mentorship, or even job offers.
4. Access to Resources: High earners who come from wealthy families may have access to resources such as private schools, universities, or networking events that can help them advance in their careers.
5. Role Modeling: Growing up with successful family members can inspire high earners to work hard and pursue their own success. Seeing the dedication and drive of their family members can motivate them to achieve their own goals.
6. Social Proof: Having a supportive family can provide social proof that can help high earners build confidence in themselves and their abilities. When surrounded by people who believe in them, they are more likely to believe in themselves and take risks to achieve greater success.
7. Shared Values: Families with shared values can provide a sense of purpose and direction for high earners. When individuals have a clear understanding of what is important to their family and community, they are more likely to align their own goals and values with those of their support system.
8. Practical Support: Families may be able to provide practical support, such as childcare or household management, which can allow high earners to focus on their careers without worrying about these responsibilities.
9. Emotional Intelligence: Growing up in a supportive family can help high earners develop emotional intelligence, which is critical for building strong relationships and
