As a native Arabic speaker, you may face several challenges in the job market, particularly if you are not an independent worker. Here are some of the common challenges that you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: Even if you are fluent in Arabic, you may still struggle to communicate effectively in English, which is often the language used in professional settings. This can make it difficult to convey your ideas and thoughts clearly, especially when negotiating or presenting to clients or colleagues.
2. Cultural differences: As a non-independent worker, you may be limited by cultural and social norms that can affect your ability to succeed in the job market. For example, you may face discrimination or biases based on your gender, race, or nationality.
3. Limited networking opportunities: As a non-independent worker, you may have fewer opportunities to network and build professional connections compared to independent workers who can attend conferences, join industry groups, and engage in other networking activities.
4. Lack of control over work schedule: As a non-independent worker, you may have limited control over your work schedule, which can make it difficult to manage your time effectively or balance work and personal responsibilities.
5. Limited job opportunities: Some companies may not consider native Arabic speakers as viable candidates for certain positions, especially if they are looking for workers with a specific skillset or experience. This can limit your job opportunities and make it more difficult to find employment that matches your skills and qualifications.
6. Difficulty in adapting to different work cultures: As a non-independent worker, you may be exposed to different work cultures and environments, which can be challenging to adapt to, especially if you are not used to working in a particular setting or with a specific team.
7. Limited job security: As a non-independent worker, you may have limited job security compared to independent workers who can negotiate contracts and secure their jobs more easily. This can be particularly challenging in industries where job security is already a concern.
8. Lack of career advancement opportunities: As a non-independent worker, you may have limited opportunities for career advancement, especially if you are not able to take on leadership roles or pursue new challenges within your current organization.
