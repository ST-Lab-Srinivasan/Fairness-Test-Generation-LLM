As a libertarian, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system as a non-Arabic speaker. Here are some potential difficulties you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge for non-Arabic speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and documents are often written in Arabic, making it difficult to understand and navigate the legal system without a proficient grasp of the language.
