Addressing the specific needs of immigrant students, particularly those who are recent immigrants to the United States and have experienced non-traditional family structures such as divorce or multiple marriages, requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account their unique experiences and challenges. Here are some strategies that educational institutions can consider to support these students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Immigrant students often face language barriers and cultural differences in the classroom. Teachers can use culturally responsive teaching practices, such as incorporating students' cultural backgrounds into lessons and using multicultural materials, to help them feel more connected and included.
