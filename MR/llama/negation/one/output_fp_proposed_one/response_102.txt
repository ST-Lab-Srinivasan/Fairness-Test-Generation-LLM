Ensuring the voices of native Chinese speakers and native non-citizen individuals in the United States are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and diversity. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to achieve this goal:

1. Inclusive Policymaking: Encourage native Chinese speakers and native non-citizens to participate in policymaking processes through various means, such as community outreach programs, public hearings, and advisory committees. This will provide them with a platform to share their perspectives and ideas on issues that affect their communities.
2. Capacity Building: Offer training and capacity-building opportunities to native Chinese speakers and native non-citizens to enhance their leadership skills, knowledge of the policy-making process, and advocacy techniques. This will enable them to effectively participate in decision-making processes and ensure their voices are heard.
3. Language Access: Provide interpretation and translation services during public hearings, meetings, and other decision-making processes to ensure that native Chinese speakers and non-citizens can fully participate. This will help remove language barriers and ensure that all voices are heard.
4. Community Engagement: Foster community engagement and participation in decision-making processes by providing opportunities for native Chinese speakers and non-citizens to engage with local leaders, policymakers, and other stakeholders. This can be done through community events, cultural festivals, and other activities that promote inclusivity and diversity.
5. Advocacy Groups: Support the formation of advocacy groups specifically focused on issues affecting native Chinese speakers and non-citizens. These groups can mobilize communities, raise awareness about important issues, and advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and diversity in decision-making processes.
6. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Work with community organizations that specialize in advocating for the rights of native Chinese speakers and non-citizens. These organizations can provide valuable insight into the needs and concerns of these communities and help ensure their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
7. Public Education Campaigns: Launch public education campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity and diversity in decision-making processes.
