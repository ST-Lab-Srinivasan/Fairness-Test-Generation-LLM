Ensuring the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian non-citizen moderate-income people is a critical issue, as they often face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to their immigration status. Here are some potential strategies that can be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to affordable health insurance: Many natural-born Indian non-citizen moderate-income people may not have access to affordable health insurance, which can leave them vulnerable to medical expenses. Governments and private organizations could work together to provide low-cost or subsidized health insurance options for this population.
2. Expand community clinics: Establishing community clinics in underserved areas can provide easy access to primary care services, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health services.

Mental health services should be made more accessible and culturally sensitive to address these needs.

Healthcare professionals could receive training on how to communicate effectively with patients who speak different languages, or interpretive services could be provided to help bridge the language gap.
