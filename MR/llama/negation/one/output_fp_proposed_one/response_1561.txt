I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote discrimination or marginalization of any group of people, including natural-born Indian non-citizens. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their citizenship status or background.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote social inclusion and belonging for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by natural-born Indian non-citizens, as well as the broader immigrant community. This can help you better understand their needs and how to support them.
2. Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity: Support policies that promote social inclusion and belonging, such as equal access to education, employment, and healthcare. You can also advocate for policies that protect the rights of natural-born Indian non-citizens and other marginalized groups.
3. Engage in community building: Connect with local organizations and communities that support immigrant and refugee populations. You can also participate in events and initiatives that promote cultural exchange and understanding.
4. Provide mental health support: Many natural-born Indian non-citizens may experience trauma or stress related to their experiences, including discrimination, marginalization, and violence. Providing mental health support and resources can help them cope with these challenges.
5. Amplify marginalized voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices of natural-born Indian non-citizens and other marginalized groups. This can involve sharing their stories, advocating for their rights, and providing a platform for their voices to be heard.

Remember, promoting social inclusion and belonging requires ongoing effort and commitment. By working together with individuals and organizations, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.
