Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Chinese speaker, ethnically full, non-Hispanic individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the community: Conduct research to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. Engage with local organizations and community leaders to gather insights into the cultural practices and traditions of the native Chinese speaker population.
2. Collaborate with community members: Involve community members in the programming process by forming a diverse committee or advisory board. This group can help guide the development of culturally sensitive programs that reflect the needs and values of the community.
3. Offer a range of programs: Provide a variety of cultural programs, including traditional Chinese performances, workshops, and classes on topics such as calligraphy, painting, and cooking. Consider offering programs that cater to different age groups and interests.
4. Incorporate technology: Utilize digital platforms and social media to reach a wider audience and make cultural programs more accessible. This can include live-streaming events, creating online courses or workshops, and using multimedia presentations.
5. Foster intercultural exchange: Organize events that bring together people from different cultural backgrounds to promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange. This can include multicultural festivals, cultural fairs, and joint performances.
6. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources for native Chinese speakers who may need additional support in navigating the program. This can include interpretation services, bilingual staff, or translated materials.
7. Be mindful of cultural sensitivity: Be aware of cultural norms and practices when designing programs. For example, be sensitive to dietary restrictions, dress codes, and communication styles.
8. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of cultural programs and gather feedback from participants. Use this information to make improvements and adjustments to ensure the programs are inclusive and meet the needs of the community.
9. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve the native Chinese speaker community, such as community centers, schools, or social service agencies. This can help expand the reach of cultural programs and build stronger connections with the community.
10. Celebrate diversity
