Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, who are ethnically full African non-Americans, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be employed to promote their participation and representation. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of their level of Arabic proficiency. Provide interpretation or translation services to facilitate participation from those who may not speak Arabic fluently.
2. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage an environment where everyone feels valued and respected. Promote cross-cultural understanding and empathy, and provide training on cultural competence and diversity.
3. Identify and address barriers: Acknowledge and address any systemic or structural barriers that may prevent marginalized groups from participating in decision-making processes. For instance, ensure that access to information and resources is equitable and that there are no unintentional biases in the decision-making process.
4. Empower marginalized voices: Provide opportunities for beginner Arabic speakers to develop their leadership skills and amplify their voices through mentorship programs, training, or networking events. Encourage them to take on leadership roles within their communities or organizations.
5. Develop inclusive policies: Create policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in decision-making processes. Ensure that these policies are communicated clearly and widely, and that they provide a framework for addressing any issues that may arise.
6. Build partnerships: Foster partnerships between organizations that represent beginner Arabic speakers and other stakeholders to ensure their voices are heard in decision-making processes. Collaborate with community leaders and advocacy groups to amplify their messages and promote their interests.
7. Use media and communication channels: Leverage media and communication channels to reach out to beginner Arabic speakers and engage them in decision-making processes. Utilize social media, email, or other digital platforms to disseminate information and gather feedback from these individuals.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to beginner Arabic speakers to help them navigate decision-making processes. This may include language training, cultural orientation, or mentorship
