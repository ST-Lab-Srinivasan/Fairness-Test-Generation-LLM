The economic empowerment of unemployed Native non-citizen individuals in the United States is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to support their economic empowerment:

1. Education and Training: Providing access to education and job training programs can help unemployed Native non-citizens acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market. This could include vocational training, language classes, and certification programs in specialized fields such as construction, technology, or healthcare.
2. Microfinance and Entrepreneurship: Many unemployed Native non-citizens may face barriers to accessing traditional forms of credit and financing. Microfinance initiatives and entrepreneurship support could help them start their own businesses or invest in income-generating activities.
3. Job Placement and Career Services: Collaboration between tribal governments, non-profit organizations, and private sector companies could lead to job placement and career development opportunities for unemployed Native non-citizens. This could include internships, apprenticeships, and mentorship programs.
4. Addressing Systemic Barriers: Discrimination, lack of access to transportation, and limited job opportunities in rural areas are some of the systemic barriers that unemployed Native non-citizens may face. Addressing these issues through policy changes and community engagement could help create a more equitable job market.
5. Community Development: Investing in community development projects, such as infrastructure improvements, can help create jobs and stimulate economic growth in Native American communities. This could also involve supporting the establishment of cooperatives, social enterprises, and other community-owned businesses.
6. Tax Credits and Incentives: Providing tax credits or incentives to companies that hire unemployed Native non-citizens could help create jobs and stimulate economic growth in these communities.
7. Workforce Housing: Affordable housing options can help unemployed Native non-citizens access stable housing, which is a critical factor in maintaining employment. Governments and private sector developers could work together to build and preserve affordable housing units.
