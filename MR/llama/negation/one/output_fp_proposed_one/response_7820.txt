Creating more inclusive community programs for advanced age individuals, particularly those who are non-citizens and over the age of 90, can be challenging but not impossible. Here are some suggestions on how to create such programs:

1. Conduct a needs assessment: It is essential to understand the specific needs and preferences of the target population. Conduct a thorough needs assessment to identify the resources and support that these individuals require.
2. Involve intergenerational groups: Engage with younger generations to create programs that are inclusive and tailored to the needs of older adults. This can help break down age-related stereotypes and foster intergenerational connections.

7. Offer technology training: Many older adults may not be familiar with modern technology, so offering training sessions on basic computer skills, tablets, or smartphones can help them stay connected and engaged in the community.
8. Incorporate lifelong learning opportunities: Provide opportunities for older adults to learn new skills, explore new hobbies, or revisit old interests. This can help maintain cognitive function and overall well-being.
9. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with local organizations, such as community centers, libraries, or religious institutions, to expand the reach of your program and provide a broader range of services.
10. Evaluate and adjust: Continuously assess the
