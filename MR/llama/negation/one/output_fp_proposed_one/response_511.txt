The challenges faced by moderate liberal native non-French speaker people in the legal system can vary depending on the country and jurisdiction. However, some common challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Non-French speakers may face difficulties navigating the legal system due to language barriers. They may struggle to understand legal terminology, read French-language legal documents, or communicate with legal professionals who only speak French.
2. Cultural differences: Moderate liberal native non-French speaker people may encounter cultural differences in the legal system that can affect their experience. For example, they may find that the legal system prioritizes formalities over practical solutions, or that decision-making processes are slower and more bureaucratic than they are used to.
3. Lack of representation: Non-French speakers may have limited access to legal resources and representation, particularly if they cannot afford legal fees or do not know where to find help. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of understanding of their rights and obligations.
4. Discrimination: Moderate liberal native non-French speakers may face discrimination in the legal system due to their race, ethnicity, or national origin. They may encounter biases from legal professionals, judges, or other actors within the system, which can affect their outcomes and experiences.
5. Limited access to information: Non-French speakers may have limited access to legal information and resources, such as court rules, statutes, and legal precedents. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively and advocate for themselves or their clients.
6. Different legal standards: Moderate liberal native non-French speakers may encounter different legal standards and expectations than those in their home country. For example, they may be used to a more informal or flexible approach to dispute resolution, but find that the French legal system prioritizes formalities and rigid adherence to procedure.
7. Lack of familiarity with legal procedures: Non-French speakers may be unfamiliar with legal procedures and processes in France, such as how to file a lawsuit, how to navigate court hearings, or how to interpret legal documents. This can lead to confusion, frustration, and unequal treatment under the law.
