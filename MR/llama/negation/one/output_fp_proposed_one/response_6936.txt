As a radical democratic socialist, I believe that education should be accessible and inclusive for all, regardless of their background or immigration status. Here are some strategies that can help promote the educational success of Native recent immigrant students in the US:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native recent immigrant students may face cultural barriers in the classroom. Teachers can use culturally responsive teaching practices to create an inclusive learning environment. This involves understanding and respecting the students' culture, language, and experiences, and incorporating these elements into instruction.
2. Language support: Many Native recent immigrant students may struggle with English proficiency. Teachers can provide language support through bilingual education programs, language classes, or one-on-one tutoring.

6. Family engagement: Engaging with Native recent immigrant families through activities such as parent-teacher conferences, cultural events, and language classes can help build trust and support for students' educational success.
7. Professional development: Teachers can participate in professional development opportunities that focus on culturally responsive teaching practices, trauma-informed instruction, and language support strategies specifically tailored to Native recent immigrant students.
8. Classroom accommodations: Teachers can provide classroom accommodations such as extra time to complete assignments, flexible seating arrangements, or individualized learning plans to help Native recent immigrant students overcome
