The military status can have significant impacts on the lives of native Spanish speakers who are not conservative. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: Military service can limit an individual's access to education and employment opportunities, particularly if they are deployed for extended periods of time. This can have long-term impacts on their career prospects and earning potential.
2. Stigma and social exclusion: Being in the military can lead to social stigma and exclusion, particularly if an individual's political views or lifestyle choices are seen as non-conformist or unacceptable by mainstream society. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
3. Emotional and psychological impacts: Military service can have significant emotional and psychological impacts on individuals, particularly those who experience trauma or witness violent events during their deployment. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
4. Financial challenges: Military service can also lead to financial challenges, particularly if an individual is deployed for extended periods of time or experiences a reduction in pay due to military regulations. This can make it difficult to maintain financial stability and plan for the future.
5. Limited freedom of expression: Military service can limit an individual's freedom of expression, particularly if they are in a non-conservative unit or are deployed in a country with strict censorship laws. This can make it difficult for individuals to express their political views or engage in activities that are perceived as controversial or subversive.
6. Difficulty reintegrating into civilian life: Military service can also make it difficult for individuals to reintegrate into civilian life, particularly if they have experienced trauma or have difficulty adjusting to non-military routines and expectations. This can lead to difficulties in finding employment, maintaining relationships, and generally adapting to civilian life.
7. Lack of autonomy: Military service can also limit an individual's autonomy, particularly if they are deployed for extended periods of time or are subject to strict military regulations. This can make it difficult for individuals to make decisions and take actions that align with their personal values and goals.
