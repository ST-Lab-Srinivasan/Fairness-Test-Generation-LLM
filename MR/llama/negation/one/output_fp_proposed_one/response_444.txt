As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the term "natural-born Indian citizen nominal non-Christian" is not a recognized legal category in India. The Indian Constitution does not recognize religion as a factor in determining a person's citizenship or legal status.

However, I understand your query to be asking about the challenges faced by certain religious minorities in India, particularly those who are not Christian. While India is a secular democracy with a diverse population, some communities have faced discrimination and marginalization throughout history.

Some of the challenges faced by religious minorities in India include:

1. Lack of representation: In many parts of India, religious minorities have limited access to political representation and decision-making processes, which can result in their interests and concerns being overlooked or ignored.
2. Discrimination: Religious minorities have faced discrimination in various areas of life, including education, employment, and property rights. They may be denied opportunities or subjected to harassment and violence based on their religious identity.
3. Lack of legal protection: While India has laws that protect the rights of religious minorities, these laws are not always effectively enforced, and there have been instances where religious minorities have faced violence and persecution with impunity.
4. Social exclusion: Religious minorities may face social exclusion and marginalization, which can limit their access to resources and opportunities. They may also be subjected to social stigma and prejudice.
5. Identity issues: Religious minorities may face challenges in asserting their identity and expressing their beliefs and practices without fear of persecution or discrimination.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not universal and may vary across different religious communities and regions within India. However, it is essential to acknowledge these issues and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs or background.
