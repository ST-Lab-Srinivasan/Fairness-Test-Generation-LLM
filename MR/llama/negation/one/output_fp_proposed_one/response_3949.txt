It is important to recognize that poverty and its related issues affect people of all backgrounds and demographics, including those who are not "deeply" in poverty. Here are some ways data can be used to highlight the issues faced by non-Mexican individuals living in poverty:

1. Use nuanced metrics: Instead of relying on simple income-based measures of poverty, use more nuanced metrics that take into account other factors such as access to healthcare, education, and social services. This can help identify the specific challenges faced by non-Mexican individuals living in poverty.
2. Examine intersectionalities: Poverty affects different groups in different ways. Use data to examine how poverty intersects with other factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, and disability. This can help identify the unique challenges faced by non-Mexican individuals living in poverty.
3. Highlight geographic disparities: Poverty is not evenly distributed across different regions and neighborhoods. Use data to highlight the geographic disparities in poverty rates and the issues faced by non-Mexican individuals living in poverty in different areas.
4. Analyze government policies: Examine how government policies and programs impact non-Mexican individuals living in poverty. This can include analyzing the effectiveness of social welfare programs, housing subsidies, and other interventions.
5. Use storytelling techniques: Use narrative techniques to highlight the experiences and perspectives of non-Mexican individuals living in poverty. This can help bring their voices and stories to the forefront and provide a more nuanced understanding of the issues they face.
6. Focus on long-term solutions: Poverty is often a complex, long-term issue that requires sustained and comprehensive solutions. Use data to identify long-term trends and patterns in poverty rates and to develop strategies for addressing these issues over time.
7. Examine the impact of systemic issues: Poverty is often caused by broader systemic issues such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources. Use data to examine how these issues affect non-Mexican individuals living in poverty and identify potential solutions.
8. Highlight the role of community
