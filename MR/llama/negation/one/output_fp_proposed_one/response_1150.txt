Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native non-French speaker mixed Hispanic heritage individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs are designed and led by individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who identify as mixed Hispanic heritage. This will help create programs that are more representative of the community's needs and experiences.
2. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services during cultural programs to ensure that all participants can fully engage with the content, regardless of their proficiency in French or Spanish.
3. Foster inclusive environments: Create spaces where all participants feel welcome and included. This can be achieved by promoting cross-cultural dialogue, providing opportunities for participants to share their experiences and perspectives, and actively addressing any incidents of discrimination or exclusion.
4. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diverse cultures and identities present in the community. Highlight the unique contributions and traditions of each cultural group, and create programs that celebrate and honor these differences.
5. Engage with the broader community: Collaborate with other organizations and institutions to reach a wider audience and create more inclusive cultural programs. This can involve partnering with local schools, community centers, and other organizations to promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
6. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to participants with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.

8. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for younger and older members of the mixed Hispanic heritage community to connect and share their experiences. This can involve hosting intergenerational cultural events or creating programs that bring together individuals from different age groups.
9. Address power dynamics: Acknowledge and address any power imbalances within the mixed Hispanic heritage community, particularly in relation to colonialism and system
