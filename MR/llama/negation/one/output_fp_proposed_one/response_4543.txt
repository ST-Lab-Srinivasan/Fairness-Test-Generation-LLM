Introduction:

The military has a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are beginner non-French speakers and non-libertarians. These individuals may face unique challenges and opportunities as they navigate their way through military life. This paper will explore the impacts of military status on the lives of beginner non-French speaker non-libertarians, including the cultural and social aspects, language barriers, and political beliefs.

Cultural and Social Aspects:

Military culture can be quite different from civilian culture, and this can create challenges for beginner non-French speaker non-libertarians. For example, military units often have their own unique traditions, customs, and ways of communicating that may be unfamiliar to those outside of the military. Additionally, the hierarchical structure of the military can be difficult for some individuals to adjust to, particularly if they are used to more egalitarian social structures.

Language Barriers:

For beginner non-French speaker non-libertarians, language barriers can be a significant challenge in the military. Many military commands and procedures are communicated in French, which can make it difficult for individuals who do not speak the language to fully participate in military activities. This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion, particularly if the individual is not able to quickly learn French or find alternative ways to communicate.

Political Beliefs:

Military service can also have a significant impact on an individual's political beliefs, particularly for beginner non-French speaker non-libertarians. The military often places a strong emphasis on loyalty and discipline, which can be at odds with the more individualistic and libertarian views of some civilian populations. Additionally, the hierarchical structure of the military can reinforce traditionalist or authoritarian political beliefs, particularly if the individual is exposed to strict chain-of-command structures and the emphasis on following orders without question.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the impacts of military status on the lives of beginner non-French speaker non-libertarians can be significant. Cultural and social aspects, language barriers, and political beliefs can all create challenges for these individuals as they navigate their way through military life
