Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent immigrants to the US, particularly for those who are ethnically full and non-Asian. Here are some ways cultural heritage impacts their lives:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and identity for recent immigrants. It helps them connect with their roots and feel part of a larger community. For example, Korean immigrants may feel a strong connection to Korean culture, traditions, and customs, which can help them navigate their new surroundings.
2. Preservation of tradition: Cultural heritage serves as a means of preserving traditional practices, beliefs, and values. Recent immigrants may strive to maintain these traditions in their new home, such as observing cultural holidays, speaking their native language at home, or cooking traditional foods. This can help them feel more grounded and connected to their community.
3. Adaptation: Cultural heritage can also play a role in adaptation to a new environment. For example, immigrants from Africa may use traditional music and dance as a means of adapting to American culture while still maintaining their own cultural identity. Similarly, immigrants from India may use Bollywood movies as a way to connect with their cultural heritage while also learning about American filmmaking techniques.
4. Resistance: Cultural heritage can provide a means of resistance against oppressive systems or structures. For example, Latinx immigrants may use traditional music and dance as a form of resistance against systemic racism and xenophobia. Similarly, immigrants from the Middle East may use their cultural heritage to challenge stereotypes and misconceptions about their region and religion.
5. Economic opportunities: Cultural heritage can also provide economic opportunities for recent immigrants. For example, immigrants from China may start businesses that cater to other Chinese immigrants, such as grocery stores or restaurants. This can help them earn a living and build a sense of community while also preserving their cultural heritage.
6. Intergenerational connections: Cultural heritage can serve as a means of connecting with the next generation of immigrants. For example, Mexican immigrants may pass down traditional cooking techniques to their children,
