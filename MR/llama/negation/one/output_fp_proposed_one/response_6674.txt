Ensuring that the educational needs of beginner non-Arabic speaker students who have been married multiple times are met can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide access to language resources: Beginner non-Arabic speaker students may face difficulties in understanding the complex grammar and syntax of Arabic. To overcome this challenge, provide them with access to language learning resources such as textbooks, audio recordings, and online courses. This will help them learn the language at their own pace and in a way that is tailored to their needs.
2. Use visual aids: Non-verbal learners may benefit from using visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and videos to help them understand the language. This can be especially helpful for beginner students who are not familiar with the culture and customs of the Arab world.
3. Foster an inclusive learning environment: Create a learning environment that is welcoming and inclusive of all students, regardless of their marital status or cultural background. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among students, and provide opportunities for them to share their experiences and perspectives.
4. Offer individualized support: Beginner non-Arabic speaker students may require additional support to keep up with the coursework. Offer individualized tutoring or mentoring sessions to help them build their language skills and confidence.

Provide students with opportunities to learn about Arab customs, traditions, and values, and encourage them to share their own cultural practices and experiences.
6. Encourage collaboration: Collaborative learning can be an effective way to help beginner non-Arabic speaker students learn the language. Pair them with more advanced students or native speakers who can provide guidance and support. This can also help build a sense of community and mutual respect among students.
7. Provide opportunities for feedback: Encourage students to share their feedback and suggestions on how the course can be improved to meet their needs. This will help you identify areas where the course may be lacking and make necessary adjustments to better serve your students.
8. Use technology: Utilize technology such as language learning apps, online
