Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for young adult beginner non-Spanish speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make these celebrations more accessible and enjoyable for everyone:

1. Provide language support: Offer translation services or provide written materials in both Spanish and the dominant language spoken by your target audience (e.g., English). This will help non-Spanish speakers to participate fully and avoid feeling left out.
2. Incorporate multilingual elements: Include activities, music, and food that cater to diverse tastes and backgrounds. For example, you could have a playlist with songs in multiple languages or serve traditional dishes from different cultures.
3. Offer cultural immersion experiences: Organize events that allow attendees to engage in interactive activities, such as cooking classes, language exchange sessions, or traditional dance workshops. These experiences can help build bridges between cultures and create a sense of community.
4. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that could be perceived as offensive or exclusive. Instead, use language that is respectful and welcoming to all participants.
5. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for attendees to share their experiences, traditions, and perspectives. This can help build a sense of belonging and inclusivity among the group.
6. Provide accessibility accommodations: Ensure that the celebration venue is wheelchair accessible, and provide accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage attendees to connect with each other through icebreaker activities or group games. This can help establish a sense of community and inclusivity among the participants.
8. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the celebration includes representation from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This can be achieved by inviting guest speakers, performers, or hosts who reflect the diversity of your target audience.
9. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be aware of cultural practices and traditions that may be unfamiliar or sensitive to non-native participants. Avoid using these elements without proper understanding, respect, and permission from the culture's
