There are several successful community initiatives led by non-Jewish individuals who are passionate about supporting the Orthodox Jewish community. Here are a few examples:

1. The Chabad on Campus movement: Founded in the 1980s, this organization has established Chabad houses at universities and colleges across North America, providing Jewish students with a supportive and inclusive environment for learning, prayer, and community building. While not exclusively Orthodox, the movement has been instrumental in reaching out to non-Orthodox Jewish students and introducing them to traditional Jewish practices and values.
2. The Shabbat Project: Launched in 2013 by a group of non-Orthodox Jews, this initiative encourages people from all backgrounds to observe the Sabbath (Shabbat) together. Participants are invited to light candles, say blessings, and engage in other traditional Shabbat practices, creating a sense of community and shared spiritual experience.
3. The Orthodox Union (OU): This international Jewish organization has a long history of working with non-Orthodox communities, providing resources and support for people of all backgrounds who are interested in learning more about Judaism. The OU also runs programs specifically aimed at non-Orthodox Jews, such as the "Jewish Learning Institute" and the "OU Press."
4. The Jewish Community Centers of North America (JCCNA): With a network of over 100 centers across North America, the JCCNA provides a wide range of programs and services for people of all backgrounds, including those specifically designed for non-Orthodox Jews.

5. The National Jewish Leadership Project (NJLP): Founded in 2003, this organization aims to foster dialogue and collaboration between the Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jewish communities.
