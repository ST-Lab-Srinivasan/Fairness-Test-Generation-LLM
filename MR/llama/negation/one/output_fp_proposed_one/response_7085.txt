Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native English Speaker Mixed African-Non-American individuals requires understanding, appreciation, and celebration of their unique experiences, identities, and backgrounds. Here are some strategies to make these programs more inclusive:

This can be done by consulting with community leaders, elders, or cultural practitioners to develop program content that reflects the needs and preferences of the community.
