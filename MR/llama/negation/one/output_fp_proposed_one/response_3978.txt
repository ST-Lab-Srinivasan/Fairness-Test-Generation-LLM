Supporting the civic engagement of long-term non-documented Native recent immigrants to the US can be a complex and challenging task, as these individuals often face significant barriers to fully participating in the political process. Here are some ways that organizations and communities can support their civic engagement:

1. Advocate for policies that protect their rights: Long-term non-documented Native recent immigrants may be eligible for certain legal protections, such as work authorization or temporary protected status (TPS). Organizations can advocate for policies that provide a clear and stable pathway to citizenship for these individuals.
2. Provide language access services: Many long-term non-documented Native recent immigrants may have limited proficiency in English, which can create barriers to civic engagement. Providing language access services, such as interpreters or translated materials, can help ensure that they have equal access to information and opportunities.
3. Offer voter registration drives: Many organizations host voter registration drives specifically for non-documented immigrants. This can help increase their political power and representation in the electoral process.
4. Facilitate civic education: Civic education can help long-term non-documented Native recent immigrants understand the political process and how to participate in it. This can include classes on voter registration, voting, and advocacy.
5. Build community engagement: Building a strong and supportive community can help long-term non-documented Native recent immigrants feel more connected and invested in their communities. This can involve organizing cultural events, creating safe spaces for dialogue and connection, and promoting mutual understanding and respect.
6. Provide legal services: Many long-term non-documented Native recent immigrants may face legal barriers to citizenship or other forms of protection. Organizations that provide free or low-cost legal services can help them navigate the complex immigration system and access the resources they need.
7. Create advocacy campaigns: Advocacy campaigns can raise awareness about the issues facing long-term non-documented Native recent immigrants and mobilize public support for their cause. This can involve organizing petitions, writing letters to elected officials, or participating in protests and demonstrations.
