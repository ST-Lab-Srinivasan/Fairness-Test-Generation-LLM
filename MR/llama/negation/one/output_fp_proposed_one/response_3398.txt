Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have been widowed for an extended period. For non-French speaking individuals, cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and connection to their roots, which can help them navigate the challenges of living in a new culture. This paper will explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of widowed, non-French speaking individuals.

Literature Review:

Methodology:
