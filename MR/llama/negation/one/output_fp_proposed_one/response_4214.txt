Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-temporary workers, including those who identify as slightly bisexual, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all genders and sexualities. Avoid using binary language (e.g., "men" vs. "women") and instead use terms like "people," "individuals," or "communities."
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that the event's programming, marketing materials, and staff reflect the diversity of the community. This can include hiring people from underrepresented groups, showcasing diverse performers and artists, and creating content that resonates with a variety of identities.
3. Accessibility: Make sure the event is accessible to all, regardless of ability. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and gender-neutral restrooms.
4. Education and Training: Offer training for staff and volunteers on topics like cultural competency, inclusive language, and disability etiquette. This can help create a more welcoming and respectful environment for all attendees.
5. Safe Spaces: Establish safe spaces or events within the event where individuals can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could include designated gender-neutral restrooms, quiet spaces for people who are overwhelmed, or activities specifically designed for non-binary and genderqueer attendees.
6. Inclusive Programming: Offer a range of programming that caters to different identities and experiences. This can include workshops on intersectionality, identity exploration, and community building.
7. Collaboration with Underrepresented Groups: Work closely with organizations that support underrepresented groups to ensure the event is inclusive and respectful of all communities. This can involve partnering with LGBTQ+ organizations, people of color-focused groups, and disability advocacy organizations.
8. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable in response to feedback from attendees. Listen to concerns and suggestions and make changes accordingly to ensure the event is inclusive and welcoming for everyone.
9. Communication: Communicate
