Supporting lower middle-income non-disabled communities can be challenging, but there are several effective strategies that can help. Here are some of them:

1. Community-based participatory research: This involves working with community members to identify their own needs and priorities, and then designing and implementing research projects that address those needs. This approach helps ensure that the research is relevant and useful to the community, and that the findings are actionable and can be used to improve community health and well-being.
2. Capacity building: Lower middle-income communities may have limited resources and infrastructure, which can make it difficult for them to implement effective health interventions. Building the capacity of community members and organizations through training and support can help address this challenge. This can involve providing training on topics such as community development, project management, and advocacy.
3. Collaboration with other organizations: Lower middle-income communities may not have access to the same resources and expertise as higher-income communities. Collaborating with other organizations, such as NGOs or government agencies, can provide access to additional resources and expertise, and help leverage collective effort to address community needs.
4. Focus on prevention: Lower middle-income communities may have limited access to healthcare services, which can make it difficult to address health issues once they arise. A focus on prevention through education, outreach, and community mobilization can help identify and address potential health problems before they become severe.
5. Involve the community in decision-making: Lower middle-income communities may have limited participation in decision-making processes that affect their health. Involving community members in decision-making through participatory processes such as community consultations, focus groups, and surveys can help ensure that community needs and priorities are taken into account when making decisions about health interventions.
6. Use of technology: Lower middle-income communities may have limited access to healthcare services due to geographical or financial constraints. Using technology such as mobile health applications, telemedicine, and remote monitoring can help bridge this gap by providing access to healthcare services from anywhere.
7. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants of health such as poverty, education, housing, and employment can have a significant impact on the health of lower
