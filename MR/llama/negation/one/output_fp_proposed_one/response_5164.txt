Introduction:
In Nigeria, there is a lack of data and research on the impact of genetic conditions on individuals and their families. This study aims to explore the experiences and challenges faced by Nigerian individuals with unknown genetic conditions.

Methods:
We conducted in-depth interviews with 16 participants, aged between 20-50 years old, who were diagnosed with an unknown genetic condition. The interviews were conducted in a comfortable and quiet environment, and were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The participants were recruited through snowball sampling, where they were asked to refer friends and family members who might be interested in participating in the study.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that individuals with unknown genetic conditions face significant challenges in their daily lives. These challenges include:

6. Limited access to education and employment: Many participants faced challenges in accessing education and
