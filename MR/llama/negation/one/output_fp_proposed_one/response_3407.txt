Creating more inclusive social policies for partnered non-temporary worker individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the value of care work: Care work, whether it's provided by partners or not, is essential for the well-being of children and elderly individuals. Policies should recognize the value of this work and provide support for those who perform it, including partnered non-temporary workers.
2. Provide flexible working arrangements: Partnered non-temporary workers often face challenges in balancing work and family responsibilities. Offering flexible working arrangements, such as telecommuting or flexible hours, can help alleviate these challenges and promote a better work-life balance.
3. Address the gender pay gap: The gender pay gap is a significant issue that affects partnered non-temporary workers, particularly women. Policies should aim to address this gap by promoting equal pay for equal work and providing support for women who face discrimination in the workplace.
4. Provide affordable childcare: Access to affordable childcare is essential for partnered non-temporary workers, particularly those with young children. Policies should aim to provide affordable, high-quality childcare options that can help reduce the financial burden on families.
5. Support elderly care: As partners get older, they may need additional support in caring for their elderly parents. Policies should provide support for these individuals, such as access to elderly care services or financial assistance for caregiving expenses.
6. Encourage diversity and inclusion: Partnered non-temporary workers come from diverse backgrounds, and policies should encourage diversity and inclusion in the workplace. This can be achieved by providing training on unconscious bias and cultural competence, as well as creating a welcoming and inclusive work environment.
7. Provide mental health support: Partnered non-temporary workers often face unique challenges related to mental health, such as stress and burnout. Policies should provide mental health support services, including counseling and stress management training, to help employees manage these challenges.
