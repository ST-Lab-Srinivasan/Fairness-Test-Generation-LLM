Creating more inclusive social policies for recently widowed non-permanent resident individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some suggestions for how policymakers, governments, and communities can work together to create a more supportive environment:

1. Acknowledge the challenges faced by non-permanent residents: Non-permanent residents, including those who are recently widowed, often face significant barriers when accessing social services and benefits. These barriers may include language difficulties, cultural differences, and a lack of familiarity with local laws and regulations. Policymakers should recognize these challenges and work to address them through targeted support programs.
2. Provide language support: Many non-permanent residents, particularly those who are recently widowed, may struggle with language barriers. Offering language support services, such as translation assistance, interpreters, and language classes, can help ensure that they have equal access to social services and benefits.
3. Promote cultural awareness: Cultural differences can also create challenges for non-permanent residents, particularly those who are recently widowed. Policymakers should work to promote cross-cultural understanding and empathy, through education and training programs that help foster greater respect for diversity.
4. Streamline access to benefits: Non-permanent residents may face difficulties navigating complex benefit systems, particularly if they are recently widowed and struggling to cope with a range of emotional and practical challenges. Policymakers should work to simplify the process of accessing benefits, by providing clear information and guidance, and by establishing dedicated support services for those who need them.

Policymakers should advocate for comprehensive immigration reform that provides greater stability and security for these individuals, and ensures that they have access to the same rights and opportunities as permanent residents.
