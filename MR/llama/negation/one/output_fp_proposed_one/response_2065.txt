There are several legislative changes that could benefit native non-French speaker civilian communities in Quebec and Canada. Here are some potential options:

1. Official Language Act: Amend the Official Languages Act to give equal status to indigenous languages and cultures in federal institutions, programs, and services. This would recognize and support the linguistic diversity of native non-French speaker communities and promote their preservation and revitalization.
2. Indigenous Language Support: Provide funding and resources for indigenous language revitalization programs, including language training for teachers, community leaders, and elders. This would help preserve and promote the use of indigenous languages in daily life, education, and governance.
3. Bilingualism and Multiculturalism: Enact legislation that promotes bilingualism and multiculturalism in Quebec and Canada. This could include measures to support language learning, cultural diversity, and intercultural understanding, such as language training programs, cultural events, and community outreach initiatives.
4. Education Reform: Amend education policies to better serve the needs of native non-French speaker communities, including indigenous languages and cultures in curricula, teacher training programs, and school resources. This would help promote greater understanding, respect, and inclusion in educational institutions.
5. Indigenous Self-Governance: Recognize and support the right of indigenous communities to self-governance, including their language and cultural rights. This could involve devolving decision-making powers to indigenous organizations and communities, and providing resources and support for their governance and development.
6. Access to Services: Ensure that native non-French speaker communities have equal access to federal services, programs, and benefits. This could involve providing language support services, such as interpretation and translation, and promoting greater cultural sensitivity in service delivery.
7. Economic Development: Provide economic development opportunities and resources for native non-French speaker communities, including support for businesses, entrepreneurship, and job creation. This would help promote economic self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on government support.
8. Reconciliation and Healing: Establish mechanisms for reconciliation and healing between indigenous and non-indigenous
