The legal system can present unique challenges for native non-Arabic speaking mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. Here are some of the specific challenges they may face:

1. Language barriers: Many mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may not be fluent in Arabic, which can create difficulties when interacting with legal professionals who primarily speak Arabic. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can negatively impact their legal experiences.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the UAE is based on Sharia law, which may not align with the cultural and religious practices of mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. For example, some may have different views on gender roles or religious interpretations, which could lead to conflicts in legal situations.
3. Lack of representation: Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may face challenges finding legal representatives who understand their unique cultural and linguistic backgrounds. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access the support they need.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin is still prevalent in many parts of the world, including the UAE. Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may face discrimination from legal professionals, judges, and other parties involved in the legal process.
5. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on their immigration status or other factors, mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may have limited access to legal resources such as legal aid services, pro bono representation, or community-based organizations that provide legal support.
6. Difficulty understanding legal procedures: The legal system in the UAE can be complex and unfamiliar to many mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. They may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and practices, which can lead to confusion and anxiety during legal proceedings.
7. Lack of trust: Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may face challenges building trust with legal professionals who do not understand their cultural backgrounds or experiences. This can make it difficult for them to feel comfortable sharing personal information or participating in legal proceedings.
8. Stigma and shame: In some cases, mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may experience stigma or shame due to their cultural identity. This can lead to feelings of isolation
