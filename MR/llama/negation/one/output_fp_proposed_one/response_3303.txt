Promoting the social inclusion of Native recent immigrants to the US in deep poverty communities can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can be effective. Here are some suggestions:

1. Culturally sensitive outreach and engagement: Develop culturally sensitive outreach and engagement strategies that take into account the unique cultural practices and values of Native American communities. This may involve partnering with community leaders and organizations to develop messaging and materials that resonate with the target population.
2. Language support: Provide language support services, such as interpretation and translation, to ensure that Native recent immigrants have access to essential services and resources. This can help bridge the language barrier and improve communication between service providers and clients.
3. Capacity building: Build the capacity of Native American organizations and community leaders to provide social services and support to their communities. This may involve training and technical assistance, as well as providing resources and funding to support these efforts.
4. Community-based initiatives: Develop community-based initiatives that are tailored to the specific needs and priorities of Native American communities. These initiatives can help build trust and social connections within the community, and promote social inclusion and participation.
5. Collaboration with other organizations: Collaborate with other organizations that serve Native American populations, such as tribal governments, non-profit organizations, and healthcare providers. This can help leverage resources and expertise to address the unique needs of these communities.
6. Policy advocacy: Advocate for policies that support the social inclusion of Native recent immigrants, such as language access laws, cultural competency training for service providers, and increased funding for community-based initiatives.
7. Economic development: Support economic development initiatives that promote job creation and entrepreneurship in Native American communities. This can help reduce poverty and improve economic stability for members of these communities.
8. Health and wellness programs: Develop health and wellness programs that are tailored to the specific needs of Native American communities. These programs can help address health disparities and promote overall well-being among community members.
9. Education and job training: Provide education and job training programs that are designed specifically for Native American communities. This can help increase access to educational and economic opportunities, and promote social inclusion
