The impact of military status on the lives of non-moderate long-term unemployed individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Stigma and social isolation: Military service can lead to a sense of stigma and social isolation for those who have been unable to find employment after serving. This can result in feelings of shame, embarrassment, and disconnection from society.
2. Financial difficulties: Non-moderate long-term unemployed individuals may struggle to make ends meet, leading to financial difficulties and stress. This can be particularly challenging for those who have had to rely on their military pension or other forms of financial assistance.
3. Lack of job opportunities: The military status can limit the job opportunities available to individuals, particularly in certain industries or fields. This can lead to a sense of frustration and helplessness, as well as difficulties in finding employment that aligns with their skills and experience.
4. Limited access to education and training: Military service members may have limited access to education and training opportunities, which can hinder their ability to acquire new skills and compete in the civilian job market.
5. Difficulty transitioning to civilian life: The transition from military to civilian life can be challenging, particularly for those who have been out of the workforce for an extended period. This can lead to difficulties in adapting to a new way of life and finding employment that aligns with their skills and experience.
6. Mental health concerns: Military service can lead to mental health concerns such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. These conditions can impact an individual's ability to find and maintain employment.
7. Lack of support: Non-moderate long-term unemployed individuals may feel a lack of support from their military chain of command or civilian communities, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and disconnection.
8. Difficulty finding employers willing to hire veterans: Some employers may be hesitant to hire veterans due to perceived difficulties in adapting to civilian life or concerns about their military experience being irrelevant in the workplace.
9. Limited job mobility
