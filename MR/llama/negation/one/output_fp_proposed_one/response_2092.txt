Addressing the Needs of Formerly Long-Time Non-Married Progressives in Disaster Response: A Call to Inclusivity and Equity

Introduction

Disasters have a way of bringing people together, regardless of their differences. However, for formerly long-time non-married progressives (FLNMPs), the response to disasters can be fraught with challenges that range from bureaucratic red tape to discrimination and marginalization. As a society, it is essential that we address these issues and ensure that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, are treated with dignity and respect during disaster response efforts.

The FLNMPs' Perspective

FLNMPs have been at the forefront of progressive movements for decades, fighting for LGBTQ+ rights, social justice, and equality. However, in times of crisis, they may find themselves marginalized or excluded from disaster response efforts due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can lead to feelings of isolation, stigma, and trauma, which can further exacerbate the existing disparities faced by this community.

Addressing the Needs of FLNMPs in Disaster Response

To address these issues, it is crucial that disaster response efforts prioritize inclusivity and equity for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Training and Education: Provide training and education on LGBTQ+ issues and disaster response for all responders, including law enforcement, emergency management officials, and volunteers. This will help create a more informed and empathetic response to the needs of FLNMPs during times of crisis.
2. Inclusive Communication: Ensure that communication strategies are inclusive and tailored to meet the needs of FLNMPs. Use language that is respectful and appropriate, and provide accessible information through various channels, such as social media, flyers, or posters.
3. Safe Spaces: Establish safe spaces for FLNMPs during disaster response efforts. These spaces should provide a sense of security, privacy, and comfort, free from discrimination or harassment
