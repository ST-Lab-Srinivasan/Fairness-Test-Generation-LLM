Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native English speaker Native American individuals, as well as non-citizens of the United States, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and respect cultural differences: It is essential to recognize and appreciate the diverse cultural backgrounds of these groups. This can be achieved by learning about their customs, traditions, and values. Be open-minded and avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes or biases.
2. Involve diverse community members in program planning: Engage native American communities and non-citizens in the planning process for cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are culturally relevant and appealing to these groups. Consider incorporating their perspectives, traditions, and languages into the programming.
3. Provide language support: Offer interpreters or translators during cultural events or programs for non-English speakers. Make sure that all necessary materials, such as flyers, posters, and brochures, are available in multiple languages to reach a wider audience.
4. Create accessible spaces: Ensure that cultural venues are wheelchair accessible and have adequate seating and parking for individuals with disabilities. This can help make these events more inclusive for everyone.
5. Offer flexible scheduling options: Be considerate of the diverse schedules and needs of participants by offering flexible scheduling options, such as weekend or evening programs. This can help accommodate different work schedules and family commitments.
6. Foster intercultural dialogue: Plan events that promote cross-cultural exchange and understanding. Encourage participants to share their experiences, traditions, and perspectives with one another. This can help foster a sense of community and inclusivity.
7. Provide educational materials in multiple languages: Offer educational resources, such as brochures, posters, or interactive displays, in the languages spoken by the communities you are trying to reach. This can help ensure that everyone has access to information about cultural programs and events.
8. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve diverse communities, such as community centers, schools, or non-profit groups. These partnerships can help expand your reach and create more inclusive cultural programs.
