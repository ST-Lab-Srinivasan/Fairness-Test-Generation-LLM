Ensuring the healthcare needs of non-civilian child people, such as those living in conflict zones or areas with limited access to healthcare, is crucial for their well-being and survival. Here are some ways to address this issue:

1. Prioritize mental health support: Children in conflict zones often experience trauma and stress, which can have long-lasting effects on their mental health. Provide psychological first aid and mental health services to help them cope with the situation.
2. Ensure access to basic medical care: Provide basic medical care, including vaccinations and check-ups, to prevent illnesses and address any medical needs that arise. This may involve setting up temporary clinics or partnering with local healthcare providers.

This can involve partnering with community leaders and organizations to identify the most effective ways to support these children.
