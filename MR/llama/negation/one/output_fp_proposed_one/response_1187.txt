Supporting the social inclusion of beginner Spanish speakers who are not independent can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language Support Groups: Organize language support groups where beginners can practice speaking and listening to Spanish in a comfortable and supportive environment. These groups can be conducted in-person or online, and can include activities such as conversation exchanges, language games, and cultural events.
