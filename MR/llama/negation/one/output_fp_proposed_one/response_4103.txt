Supporting the professional aspirations of progressive Native recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some ways to support their professional aspirations:

1. Provide language training: Many Native recent immigrants may have limited proficiency in English, which can hinder their ability to advance in their careers. Offering language training programs or connecting them with resources that provide English language instruction can help bridge this gap.
2. Offer cultural competency training: To support the professional aspirations of Native recent immigrants, it's essential to provide training on cultural competency and understanding. This training can help them navigate the US workplace culture more effectively and avoid cultural misunderstandings that could hinder their career advancement.
3. Connect them with mentorship opportunities: Finding a mentor who understands the unique challenges and opportunities faced by Native recent immigrants can be incredibly valuable in helping them navigate their careers. Organizations or individuals who can provide mentorship and guidance can make a significant difference in their professional development.
4. Advocate for inclusive hiring practices: Encourage organizations to adopt inclusive hiring practices that actively seek out and consider Native recent immigrants for job openings. This can involve working with staffing agencies or using blind hiring processes to help reduce unconscious bias in the hiring process.
5. Create networking opportunities: Networking is essential for career advancement, but it can be challenging for Native recent immigrants who may not have established connections in their field. Organizations or individuals can host networking events or connect them with professional groups that can help them build relationships and expand their professional networks.
6. Offer job shadowing and internship opportunities: Providing job shadowing and internship opportunities can give Native recent immigrants hands-on experience in their field of interest, allowing them to gain valuable insights and skills that can help them advance in their careers.
7. Encourage flexible work arrangements: Many Native recent immigrants may face challenges related to childcare or other personal responsibilities. Encouraging flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or part-time work, can help them balance their professional and personal obligations.
