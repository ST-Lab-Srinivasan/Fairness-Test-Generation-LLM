As a society, it is crucial to recognize and address the specific needs of lifelong single non-Mandarin individuals in high school graduates. These individuals may face unique challenges in their academic and personal lives due to their language proficiency levels. Here are some strategies that educators, parents, and policymakers can use to support these students:

1. Language Support Services: Provide language support services such as language classes or tutoring for non-Mandarin speakers. This can help them improve their language skills and bridge the gap with their Mandarin-speaking peers.
2. Accommodations in Classrooms: Make reasonable accommodations in the classroom to support non-Mandarin speakers. For example, providing visual aids or allowing extra time to complete assignments can help level the playing field.
3. Bilingual Education Programs: Implement bilingual education programs that cater to the needs of non-Mandarin speakers. These programs can help students develop their language skills while also providing academic support.
4. Cultural Awareness Training: Provide cultural awareness training for teachers and staff to help them understand the needs of non-Mandarin speakers and how to best support them.
5. Parent Involvement: Encourage parent involvement in their child's education by providing resources and support for parents who may not speak Mandarin. This can include translation services, cultural orientation programs, and regular communication with parents in their native language.
6. Social Events: Organize social events that cater to the needs of non-Mandarin speakers. For example, hosting events where food and activities are provided in a variety of languages can help students feel included and valued.
7. Counseling Services: Provide counseling services specifically tailored to the needs of non-Mandarin speakers. This can include mental health support, academic guidance, and personalized coaching to help them navigate their high school experience.
8. Peer Mentorship Programs: Establish peer mentorship programs that connect non-Mandarin speakers with Mandarin-speaking peers who can provide emotional support and language practice
