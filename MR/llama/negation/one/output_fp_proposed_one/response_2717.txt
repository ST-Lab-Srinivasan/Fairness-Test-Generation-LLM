Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-genetic condition individuals in the third trimester of pregnancy requires careful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is wheelchair accessible, has a clear path for those with mobility issues, and provides accessible seating options. Offer additional accommodations such as sign language interpreters or audio describers upon request.
2. Moderated activities: Provide opportunities for individuals to participate in activities that are tailored to their abilities and comfort levels. For example, offer modified yoga classes or art workshops that can be adapted for those with limited mobility.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language throughout the event promotion and programming. Avoid using terms like "able-bodied" or "non-disabled" as these can be seen as marginalizing. Instead, use language that acknowledges and includes individuals of all abilities.
4. Representation: Ensure that the cultural events feature representations of individuals with non-genetic conditions. This could include performances by artists with disabilities, exhibitions showcasing artwork created by individuals with disabilities, or incorporating stories and perspectives from individuals with disabilities into the event programming.
5. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, using dim lighting, and providing comfortable seating options. Offer quiet spaces for individuals who may need a break from the stimulation.
6. Accommodations for pregnant individuals: Provide accommodations specifically for pregnant individuals, such as designated seating areas or modifications to physical activities to avoid overexertion.
7. Collaboration with disability organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to co-create and promote the cultural events. This can help ensure that the events are accessible and inclusive for all participants.
8. Education and awareness: Provide educational materials and resources throughout the event to educate attendees on disability etiquette, terminology, and the importance of accessibility.
9. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from attendees, particularly those with disabilities, on how to improve future events. Use this feedback
