The impact of immigration status on the lives of temporary visa holders, particularly those who are not independent, can be significant and far-reaching. Some of the common impacts include:

1. Limitations on Work and Study Opportunities: Temporary visa holders may face restrictions on their ability to work or study in certain fields or institutions. They may also have limited access to job opportunities, as they may not be eligible for certain positions due to their immigration status.
2. Difficulties in Accessing Healthcare: Temporary visa holders may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they are not covered under a valid health insurance plan. They may also experience delays or difficulties in obtaining medical treatment due to their immigration status.
3. Insecurity and Instability: The uncertainty and insecurity associated with temporary visa status can lead to feelings of instability and insecurity among non-independent individuals. They may feel uncertain about their future and the possibility of being deported or having their visa revoked.
4. Difficulties in Establishing Personal Relationships: Temporary visa holders, particularly those who are not independent, may face challenges in establishing personal relationships with others, including romantic partners and friends. They may experience difficulties in building a life and community due to their immigration status.
5. Lack of Social Integration: Non-independent temporary visa holders may struggle to integrate into the local community due to their immigration status. They may face discrimination, stigma, or social isolation, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being.
6. Financial Insecurities: Temporary visa holders, particularly those who are not independent, may experience financial insecurities due to their immigration status. They may have limited access to financial resources or face difficulties in obtaining credit or loans.
7. Dependence on Sponsors or Employers: Non-independent temporary visa holders may be dependent on their sponsors or employers for their living expenses and other necessities. This can limit their autonomy and independence, as they may be subject to the whims of their sponsors or employers.
8. Limited Access to Legal Support
