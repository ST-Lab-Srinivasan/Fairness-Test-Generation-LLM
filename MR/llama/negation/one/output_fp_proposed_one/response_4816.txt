Supporting the social inclusion of people who identify as actively partially or strictly partly asexual can be challenging, as society often expects individuals to conform to traditional gender and sexuality norms. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of these individuals:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by asexual individuals, including those who identify as partially or strictly partly asexual. This will help you better understand their needs and provide appropriate support.
2. Be respectful: Avoid making assumptions about someone's sexuality based on their gender identity or expression. Recognize that asexuality is a valid and legitimate identity, and treat individuals with respect and dignity regardless of their sexual orientation.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is interested in romantic or sexual relationships. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of human experience, such as "I'm here for you, no matter what your relationship needs are."
4. Create safe spaces: Host events or create online spaces where asexual individuals can feel comfortable and supported. Provide clear guidelines on how to interact with asexual individuals and avoid pressuring them into disclosing more than they're comfortable sharing.
5. Listen actively: When engaging with asexual individuals, listen attentively and avoid interrupting or dismissing their experiences. Show empathy and understanding, and acknowledge the value of their perspective.
6. Support asexual-friendly policies: Advocate for workplace policies that support asexual employees, such as flexible work arrangements or confidentiality guarantees. Encourage organizations to provide training on asexuality and how to create inclusive environments.
7. Be patient and understanding: Asexual individuals may face discrimination or harassment due to their identity. Be patient and understanding when engaging with them, and recognize that they deserve the same respect and dignity as any other individual.
8. Celebrate asexual visibility: Participate in events or create content that celebrates asexual visibility and promotes understanding and acceptance of asexual identities. This can help normalize asexuality and create a more inclusive environment for everyone.
9. Engage in advocacy: Adv
