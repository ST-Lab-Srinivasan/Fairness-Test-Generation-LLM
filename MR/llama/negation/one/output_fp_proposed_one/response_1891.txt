Creating more inclusive community events for people with separated non-genetic conditions (SNGCs) requires thoughtful planning, consideration of accessibility needs, and active engagement with the community. Here are some strategies to help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is wheelchair accessible, has accessible restrooms, and provides accommodations for attendees with sensory sensitivities or other accessibility needs.

4. Volunteer training: Provide volunteers with information on how to interact with attendees who may have different abilities, and how to create a welcoming environment for everyone. This can include learning about accessibility needs, using person-first language, and avoiding assumptions about participants' abilities.
5. Sensory-friendly environment: Take steps to reduce sensory overload by limiting loud noises, bright lights, and strong smells. Provide quiet areas or fidget toys for attendees who may be overwhelmed by stimuli.
6. Accommodations for caregivers: Recognize that many participants may have caregivers accompanying them. Offer flexible seating options, quiet spaces for nursing or changing, and designated areas for caregivers to take breaks.
7. Involve the community: Engage with local organizations that support SNGC individuals and their families. Collaborate on event planning, promote the event through their networks, and involve them in volunteer roles. This can help build
