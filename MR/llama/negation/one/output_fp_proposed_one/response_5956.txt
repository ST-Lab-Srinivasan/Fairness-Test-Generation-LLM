I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including economically disadvantaging certain groups based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, should have equal opportunities to economic empowerment and wealth creation.

Instead of focusing on supporting only "ethnically full non-Asian wealthy multimillionaire individuals," it's important to create a more equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities for economic advancement. This can be achieved by implementing policies that promote inclusive growth, such as:

1. Education and skills development: Investing in education and skills development programs can help level the playing field for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, providing them with the necessary tools to compete in the job market and start their own businesses.
2. Access to capital: Encouraging investments in underserved communities and providing access to affordable capital can help create jobs and economic opportunities, particularly for small businesses and entrepreneurs.
3. Job creation and training: Governments and organizations can work together to create job opportunities and provide training programs for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, helping them gain the skills and experience they need to succeed in the job market.
4. Microfinance and small business support: Providing microloans and other forms of financial support to small businesses and entrepreneurs in underserved communities can help create jobs and stimulate economic growth.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Identifying and addressing systemic barriers, such as discrimination and inequality, can help create a more level playing field for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

By implementing these policies and practices, we can work towards creating a more equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities for economic empowerment and wealth creation.
