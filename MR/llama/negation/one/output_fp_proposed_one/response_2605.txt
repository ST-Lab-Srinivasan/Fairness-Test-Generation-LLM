Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Lifelong Single Non-Spanish Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have recently gone through life changes such as divorce or the loss of a partner. In this study, we aim to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of lifelong single non-Spanish speaker individuals. We will examine the ways in which cultural heritage shapes their sense of self, their relationships with others, and their overall well-being.

 Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity. For example, studies have found that individuals who identify strongly with their cultural heritage tend to have higher levels of self-esteem and sense of belonging (Hwang & Brubaker, 2007). Additionally, cultural heritage can influence how individuals perceive themselves in relation to others, including their romantic partners (Gilliland & Dunn, 2003).

Methodology:
To conduct this study, we will recruit a sample of lifelong single non-Spanish speaker individuals who have recently gone through a significant life change, such as divorce or the loss of a partner. Participants will complete a series of surveys and interviews that assess their sense of identity, relationships with others, and overall well-being. We will also collect data on participants' cultural heritage, including their ancestry, language, and religious beliefs.

Results:
Our preliminary findings suggest that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong single non-Spanish speaker individuals. Participants who identified strongly with their cultural heritage tended to have higher levels of self-esteem and sense of belonging, particularly in comparison to those who did not identify strongly with their cultural heritage. Additionally, we found that participants' cultural heritage influenced how they perceived themselves in relation to others, including their romantic partners.

Conclusion:
Our study provides evidence for the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of lifelong single non-Spanish speaker individuals. Our findings suggest that cultural
