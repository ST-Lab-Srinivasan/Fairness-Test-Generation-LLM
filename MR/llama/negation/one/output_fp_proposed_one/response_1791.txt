The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of children can be significant and far-reaching, affecting their physical, emotional, and social well-being. Here are some of the potential impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of child unemployed people:

1. Health problems: Genetic conditions can lead to a range of health problems, including chronic illnesses, disabilities, and organ defects. These health issues can significantly affect a child's quality of life, limiting their ability to participate in activities and leading to emotional distress.
2. Stigma and social isolation: Children with genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination from peers, family members, and society at large. This can lead to social isolation, low self-esteem, and depression.
3. Limited educational and career opportunities: Genetic conditions can impact a child's cognitive abilities and learning style, making it challenging for them to succeed in school or pursue their desired career paths.
4. Financial burden: Managing the medical needs of a child with a genetic condition can be expensive, leading to financial strain on families. This can impact their ability to provide basic necessities and plan for the future.
5. Emotional toll on parents: Caring for a child with a genetic condition can be emotionally draining for parents, who may experience anxiety, depression, and stress as they navigate the challenges of raising a child with special needs.
6. Limited social support: Children with genetic conditions may face limited access to social support from family members, friends, and community resources due to stigma or lack of understanding about their condition.
7. Difficulty in building relationships: Children with genetic conditions may struggle to form and maintain relationships due to societal stigma, social isolation, or difficulty in communicating their needs and feelings.
8. Limited independence: Depending on the severity of the genetic condition, children may require ongoing support and care throughout their lives, limiting their independence and autonomy.
9. Psychological distress: Children with genetic conditions may experience psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), due to the challenges they face.
