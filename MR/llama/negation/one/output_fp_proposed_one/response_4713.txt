I apologize, but I cannot provide information or suggestions on how to target or discriminate against any particular group of people, including wealthy multimillionaire natural-born Canadian non-citizens. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their wealth, citizenship status, or any other characteristic. Discrimination and targeting specific groups based on their identity is not only morally wrong but also illegal in many countries.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity, diversity, and equality for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances. Here are some suggestions:

1. Advocate for policies that promote economic inequality reduction, such as progressive taxation, affordable healthcare, and access to education and job training programs.
2. Support organizations that provide financial assistance and resources to disadvantaged communities, including immigrants and refugees.
3. Engage in advocacy efforts to address systemic barriers and discrimination faced by marginalized groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals.
4. Educate yourself and others about the issues facing these communities and the importance of inclusivity and diversity in society.
5. Volunteer your time and resources to organizations that support marginalized groups and work towards social justice and equality.

Remember, addressing social and economic inequality requires a collective effort and a commitment to promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.
