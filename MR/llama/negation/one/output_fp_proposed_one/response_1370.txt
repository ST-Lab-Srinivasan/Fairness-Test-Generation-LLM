Native non-Arabic speaker mixed Asian heritage people may face a range of challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: Many legal proceedings are conducted in Arabic, which can create difficulties for non-Arabic speakers in understanding and navigating the legal process.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the UAE is based on Islamic law (Shariah), which may not align with the cultural practices and beliefs of mixed Asian heritage individuals.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against non-Arabic speakers and those of mixed heritage is still prevalent in the UAE. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of access to legal resources.
4. Lack of representation: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may have limited access to legal aid or representation, which can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
5. Unfamiliarity with local customs and laws: As a result of cultural differences and language barriers, mixed Asian heritage individuals may be unfamiliar with local customs and laws, leading to confusion and mistakes in legal proceedings.
6. Limited access to legal resources: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may have limited access to legal resources such as translators, interpreters, and cultural advisors, which can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
7. Lack of understanding of legal rights: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may have a limited understanding of their legal rights and responsibilities, making it harder for them to advocate for themselves in legal proceedings.
8. Difficulty in proving discrimination: Proving discrimination based on race, ethnicity or national origin can be challenging, especially in countries where the legal system is not designed to address these issues.
9. Lack of data and research: There may be a lack of data and research on the experiences of mixed Asian heritage individuals in the legal system, which can make it difficult to identify and address the specific challenges they face.
10. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation or arbitration, which can limit their options for resolving disputes outside of the court system.
