4. Limited job opportunities: In some regions, there may be limited job opportunities for non-native Spanish speakers, especially in industries where fluency in Spanish is required.
5. Difficulty navigating the job market: Non-native Spanish speakers may find it challenging to navigate the job market, especially if they are not familiar with the job search processes and requirements.
6. Limited access to resources: Non-native Spanish speakers may have limited access to resources such as job fairs, networking events, and career counseling services.
7. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-native Spanish speakers may face discrimination in the workplace, which can make it difficult to advance in their careers.
