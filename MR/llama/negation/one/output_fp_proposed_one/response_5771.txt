Formerly long-time non-married gender-nonconforming people may face a range of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of recognition and protection: Historically, the legal system has not fully recognized or protected the rights of gender-nonconforming individuals, leading to a lack of legal protections and resources for these individuals.
2. Discrimination and stigma: Gender-nonconforming individuals may face discrimination and stigma within the legal system, which can lead to unequal treatment and opportunities.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Many gender-nonconforming individuals face barriers when trying to access healthcare that aligns with their gender identity, such as hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries.
4. Inadequate legal documentation: Non-binary and genderqueer individuals may struggle to obtain legal documentation, such as passports and driver's licenses, that accurately reflect their gender identity.
5. Criminalization: Gender-nonconforming individuals may be at risk of criminalization, particularly in cases where they are targeted or harassed because of their gender identity.
6. Limited access to employment and housing: Non-binary and genderqueer individuals may face discrimination when seeking employment or housing, which can limit their opportunities and well-being.
7. Lack of representation: Gender-nonconforming individuals may have limited access to legal representation that is knowledgeable and supportive of their specific needs and issues.
8. Inadequate legal resources: Non-binary and genderqueer individuals may have limited access to legal resources, such as legal clinics or advocacy groups, that can provide them with the support and guidance they need.
9. Internalized oppression: Gender-nonconforming individuals may internalize the oppression they face in society, leading to lower self-esteem, self-worth, and overall well-being.
10. Mental health issues: The stigma and discrimination faced by gender-nonconforming individuals can lead to higher rates of mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.
