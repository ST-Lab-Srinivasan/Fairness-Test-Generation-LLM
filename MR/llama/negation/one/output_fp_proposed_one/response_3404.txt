As an AI language model, I cannot generalize the experiences of all advanced aged individuals who are non-Chinese speakers in the healthcare system. However, based on available data and research, here are some common challenges faced by this group:

1. Language barriers: Non-Chinese speakers may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers due to language barriers. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnosis, or delayed treatment.
2. Cultural differences: Advanced aged individuals from different cultures may have different expectations and beliefs about healthcare, which can create challenges in the healthcare system. For example, some cultures may place a higher value on traditional healing practices than Western medicine.
3. Accessibility issues: Non-Chinese speakers may face difficulties accessing healthcare services due to language barriers or lack of transportation. This can lead to delayed or missed medical appointments, which can have negative consequences for their health.
4. Limited health literacy: Advanced aged individuals with limited health literacy may struggle to understand complex medical information, leading to misunderstandings about their condition and treatment options.
5. Discrimination: Non-Chinese speakers may face discrimination or bias in the healthcare system, which can affect their access to care and overall experience.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Advanced aged individuals who are non-Chinese speakers may find it difficult to navigate the healthcare system, including understanding insurance coverage, finding providers who speak their language, and accessing specialized care.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Non-Chinese speakers may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists or oncologists, due to language barriers or lack of transportation.
8. Difficulty in advocating for themselves: Advanced aged individuals who are non-Chinese speakers may find it difficult to advocate for themselves in the healthcare system, which can lead to delays or inadequate care.
9. Limited access to technology: Non-Chinese speakers may have limited access to technology, such as telemedicine, which can limit their ability to access healthcare services remotely.
10. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The healthcare system may not always be culturally sensitive
