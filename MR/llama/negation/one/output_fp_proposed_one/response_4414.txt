Supporting young adult beginner non-Spanish speaker communities can be a rewarding and challenging task. Here are some effective strategies that have been found to be helpful:

1. Immersion: Immersion is an excellent way to learn any language, including Spanish. Encourage the young adults to surround themselves with native Spanish speakers, watch Spanish movies and TV shows, listen to Spanish music, and read Spanish books. This will help them get used to the sound and structure of the language.
2. Language exchange programs: Organize language exchange programs where young adult beginners can practice speaking with more advanced learners or native speakers. This will give them an opportunity to gain confidence in their speaking skills and receive feedback on their progress.
3. Cultural events: Host cultural events that celebrate Spanish-speaking countries and their traditions. This could include festivals, concerts, or food fairs. Encourage the young adults to participate and engage with the culture.
4. Language classes: Offer language classes specifically designed for young adult beginners. These classes can cover basic grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, as well as more advanced topics such as conversation and reading comprehension.
5. Practice activities: Provide opportunities for young adults to practice their Spanish skills in a fun and relaxed environment. This could include games, quizzes, and other interactive activities that encourage them to use the language.
6. Technology: Utilize technology to support language learning, such as language learning apps, online courses, or podcasts. These resources can provide additional practice opportunities outside of classroom settings.
7. Peer support: Encourage young adults to learn from and support each other in their language journey. This could include creating a study group or connecting them with other beginners who are also learning Spanish.
8. Authentic materials: Use authentic materials such as news articles, videos, and podcasts to expose young adults to real-life Spanish language use. This will help them learn how to understand and communicate effectively in everyday situations.
9. Feedback and assessment: Provide regular feedback and assessment opportunities to help young adults track their progress and identify areas for improvement. This could include quizzes, tests, or one-on-one evaluations with a teacher
