1. Use visual aids: Provide images, videos, or pictures of the cultural items being celebrated to help children understand the context and significance of the event.
2. Simplify language: Use simple language that is easy for non-French speakers to understand. Avoid using complex vocabulary or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to them.
