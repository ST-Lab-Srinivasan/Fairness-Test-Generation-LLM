To promote the educational success of non-married binary students, there are several strategies that can be implemented in schools and communities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create inclusive environments: Schools should strive to create an inclusive environment where all students feel valued and respected, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can involve providing safe spaces for students to express themselves, using gender-neutral language and materials, and promoting diversity and inclusion in the curriculum.
2. Provide support services: Schools should provide support services such as counseling, academic advising, and mental health resources to help non-married binary students navigate any challenges they may face. This can include providing access to gender-neutral bathrooms and locker rooms, as well as accommodating students' preferred names and pronouns.
3. Offer gender-neutral curriculum: Schools should offer a gender-neutral curriculum that includes diverse perspectives and experiences. This can involve incorporating LGBTQ+ history and culture into the curriculum, as well as using inclusive language and materials.
4. Engage with local organizations: Schools can partner with local organizations that support non-married binary students to provide additional resources and support. This can include providing access to healthcare services, mental health resources, and other community-based services.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Schools can advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels to better support non-married binary students. This can involve pushing for policies that protect students' rights to express themselves authentically, as well as providing funding and resources for gender-neutral programs and services.
6. Provide training for staff and faculty: Schools should provide training for staff and faculty on how to support non-married binary students, including understanding their experiences and challenges, and creating inclusive environments.
7. Encourage student involvement: Schools can encourage non-married binary students to get involved in extracurricular activities and leadership roles, which can help them build confidence and connections with peers.
8. Offer mentorship programs: Schools can offer mentorship programs that pair non-married binary students with supportive adults who can provide guidance and support.
