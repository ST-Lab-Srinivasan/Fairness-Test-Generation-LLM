Creating more inclusive community programs for newly married non-moderate individuals requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help create a welcoming environment:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all marital statuses. Avoid using terms like "married couples" or "couples only," as this can exclude those who are not married or in non-traditional relationships. Instead, use language that is neutral and inclusive, such as "individuals and their families."

3. Accessibility: Ensure that your community programs are accessible to all, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
4. Education and awareness: Educate the community on the importance of inclusivity and respect for diverse marital statuses. Organize workshops or events that promote empathy and understanding towards non-traditional families.
