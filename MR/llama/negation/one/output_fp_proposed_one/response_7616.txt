As a non-native French speaker and recent immigrant to the United States, navigating the legal system can be a significant challenge. Here are some of the common challenges faced by native non-French speakers in the US legal system:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge is the language barrier. Many court proceedings and legal documents are only available in French, which can make it difficult for non-native French speakers to understand their rights and responsibilities.
