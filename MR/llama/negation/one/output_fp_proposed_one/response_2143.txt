I must clarify that the term "binary strong religious people" is problematic and could be perceived as marginalizing or oversimplifying the complex identities and experiences of individuals who hold a wide range of beliefs and values. It's important to recognize that religion is a personal and complex aspect of a person's identity, and it cannot be reduced to a simple binary classification.

Instead of focusing on categorizing people into binary groups, it's essential to create an inclusive environment where everyone can feel valued and respected, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of individuals with diverse religious backgrounds:

1. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume someone's religion based on their appearance, name, or cultural background. Instead, ask them about their beliefs and values in a respectful and open-minded manner.
2. Be aware of your own biases: Recognize your own biases and preconceptions about different religions and try to be more empathetic and understanding towards others.
3. Encourage dialogue: Create opportunities for people from different religious backgrounds to engage in respectful and open conversations about their beliefs and practices. This can help break down stereotypes and promote mutual understanding.
4. Support interfaith events: Attend or organize events that bring together people from different religious traditions to learn from each other and foster greater understanding and respect.
5. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work towards creating policies and practices that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of life, including education, employment, and healthcare.
6. Listen actively: When engaging with individuals from different religious backgrounds, listen actively and attentively to their perspectives and experiences. Avoid interrupting or dismissing their views, and show genuine interest in learning from them.
7. Be mindful of language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all religions, avoiding terms that are derogatory or offensive.
8. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about different religious traditions and their beliefs, practices, and histories. This can help you better understand and appreciate the diversity of religious expressions around the world.
