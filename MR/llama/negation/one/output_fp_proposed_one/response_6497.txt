Creating more inclusive social policies for lifelong, single, natural-born, non-citizen individuals requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Acknowledge and validate their experiences: Listen to the stories and experiences of non-citizen individuals, and recognize the difficulties they face in their daily lives. Validate their feelings and experiences, and create a safe space for them to share their thoughts and concerns.
2. Provide access to education and job training: Offer language classes, vocational training, and other forms of education that can help non-citizen individuals acquire new skills and knowledge. This can improve their employability and help them become self-sufficient.
3. Advocate for immigration reform: Work with policymakers to pass comprehensive immigration reform that provides a clear pathway to citizenship for non-citizen individuals who are already contributing to society. This can help reduce the fear and uncertainty that many non-citizens face, and promote greater stability and security in their lives.
4. Promote cultural understanding and empathy: Encourage people to learn about and appreciate different cultures and backgrounds. This can help break down stereotypes and build bridges between communities, creating a more inclusive and compassionate society.
5. Support mental health services: Provide access to mental health services that cater to the unique needs of non-citizen individuals, who may experience stress, anxiety, and other mental health challenges due to their immigration status.
6. Advocate for affordable housing: Work with developers and policymakers to create more affordable housing options that are accessible to non-citizens, including those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.
7. Improve healthcare access: Ensure that non-citizen individuals have access to quality, affordable healthcare services, regardless of their immigration status. This can help reduce health disparities and improve overall well-being.
8. Encourage community engagement: Facilitate opportunities for non-citizens to participate in local governance and community activities, such as volunteering, voting, and attending public meetings. This can help build trust
