As a beginner non-Spanish speaker, early teenagers (ages 13-15) may face several challenges when navigating the healthcare system in Spain. Here are some potential difficulties they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: Not being fluent in Spanish can create a significant obstacle for young people who need to communicate with healthcare professionals, fill out forms or read medical information. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications, which could compromise their care.
2. Limited access to information: Depending on the region or town, some areas may have limited English-speaking medical staff, making it difficult for young people to get the information they need about their health conditions, treatments, and follow-up appointments.
3. Cultural differences: Healthcare systems and cultural attitudes towards illness can vary significantly between countries. Beginner non-Spanish speakers may struggle to understand these differences and navigate the healthcare system accordingly.

6. Difficulty with administrative tasks: Filling out forms, scheduling appointments, and dealing with insurance companies can be confusing and time-consuming, especially for young people who are not fluent in Spanish.

9. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system independently: Young people who are not fluent in Spanish may need help from family members or interpreters to navigate the healthcare system, which
