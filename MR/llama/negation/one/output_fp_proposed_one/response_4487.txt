Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to diverse patient populations, including native non-French speakers and recent immigrants to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these groups:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients from different cultures.
