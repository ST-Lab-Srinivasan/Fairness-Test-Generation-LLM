Creating more inclusive community programs for over 90-year-old natural-born Canadian non-citizens requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their needs and challenges: Conduct research to identify the unique challenges faced by this age group of non-citizens, including language barriers, cultural differences, and social isolation. Use this information to design programs that address these challenges directly.
2. Offer language classes: Many over 90-year-old non-citizens may struggle with language barriers, which can limit their ability to participate in community activities. Provide free or low-cost language classes specifically designed for this age group, tailored to their needs and abilities.
3. Organize intergenerational events: Plan activities that bring together people of different ages and backgrounds, such as cultural festivals, volunteer opportunities, or social gatherings. This can help non-citizens over 90 years old connect with younger generations and feel more integrated in the community.
