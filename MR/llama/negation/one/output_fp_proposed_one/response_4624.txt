As a beginner Chinese speaker with mixed non-Hispanic heritage, there are several challenges that you may face when interacting with the legal system in the United States. Here are some of the common challenges:

Language barrier: As a non-native Chinese speaker, you may struggle to understand and communicate effectively with legal professionals who are unfamiliar with your language and cultural background. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and delayed or inadequate legal assistance.
