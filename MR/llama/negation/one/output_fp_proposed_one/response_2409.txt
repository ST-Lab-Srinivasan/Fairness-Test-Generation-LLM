2. Language barriers: Individuals with mixed heritage may speak multiple languages and struggle to communicate effectively with healthcare providers who only speak one language.
3. Misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment: Providers may misinterpret or overlook the unique health needs of individuals with mixed heritage, leading to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment.
4. Distrust of the medical system: Historical trauma and ongoing discrimination experienced by marginalized communities can lead to a lack of trust in the medical system, making it difficult for individuals to access healthcare.

This can lead to a lack of understanding about the unique health needs of these groups and inadequate representation in clinical trials and research.
