Supporting the civic engagement of individualist Native American recent immigrants to the US can be challenging, as they may face unique barriers to participation in the political process. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Culturally sensitive outreach and education: Develop culturally sensitive outreach and education strategies that take into account the unique cultural backgrounds of Native American immigrants. Provide information on voting processes, electoral systems, and civic participation in a way that is respectful and relevant to their experiences.
2. Language accessibility: Ensure that language accessibility is provided for Native American immigrants who may not be fluent in English. Provide translation services, interpreters, or bilingual materials to help them participate in the political process.
3. Building trust: Establish relationships with Native American immigrant communities and work to build trust through consistent communication, transparency, and follow-through on commitments. This can involve regularly engaging with community members, listening to their concerns, and providing support and resources.
4. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for Native American immigrants to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to participate in the political process. This can include voter registration drives, civic education workshops, and leadership development programs.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address the unique needs and challenges faced by Native American immigrants, such as language preservation, cultural sensitivity in government services, and access to healthcare and social services.
6. Community mobilization: Mobilize community members to participate in civic activities, such as voter registration drives, protests, and advocacy campaigns. This can involve organizing events, creating social media campaigns, and building coalitions with other marginalized communities.
7. Voter registration drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting Native American immigrant communities to help them exercise their right to vote. Provide information on voting processes, voter ID requirements, and transportation to polling stations.
8. Civic education: Offer civic education programs that teach Native American immigrants about the political process, voting systems, and how to advocate for policies that affect their communities.
