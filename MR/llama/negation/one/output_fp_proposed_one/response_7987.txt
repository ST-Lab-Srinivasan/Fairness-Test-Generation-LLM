Creating more inclusive cultural programs for deep in poverty non-disabled individuals requires a deliberate effort to address the systemic barriers and biases that prevent marginalized communities from participating in cultural activities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Engagement: Involve members of the community in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are responsive to the needs and interests of the community.
2. Accessibility: Make cultural programs more accessible to marginalized communities by providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Diversity in Programming: Offer a diverse range of cultural programs that reflect the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities. This can help ensure that these communities feel represented and included in the cultural offerings.
4. Scholarships and Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance to individuals who may not have the resources to participate in cultural programs. This can help ensure that all members of the community have access to cultural opportunities, regardless of their socioeconomic status.
5. Outreach and Education: Educate community members about the importance of cultural inclusion and the benefits of participation in cultural programs. This can help build support for inclusive cultural initiatives and encourage more individuals from marginalized communities to participate.
6. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve marginalized communities to co-create and promote cultural programs. This can help increase visibility and accessibility of the programs, particularly in communities where there may be a lack of resources or knowledge about cultural opportunities.
7. Flexible Programming: Offer flexible programming options that can accommodate different schedules and needs of community members. For example, offering cultural programs in the evenings or on weekends to accommodate those with busy schedules or who may not have access to transportation during the day.
8. Accessibility of Venues: Ensure that venues for cultural programs are accessible to all community members, including those with disabilities. This can involve providing wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and audio descriptions.
9. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for cultural program staff on cultural competency and inclusive programming practices
