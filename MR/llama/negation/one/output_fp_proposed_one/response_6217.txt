Ensuring that the voices of native non-Arabic speaker mixed Hispanic heritage individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to create inclusive environments and remove barriers to participation. Here are some strategies that can help:

This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce unintentional biases.

This can be done by using collaborative tools, such as facilitated workshops or online forums, to gather input and feedback from these communities.
