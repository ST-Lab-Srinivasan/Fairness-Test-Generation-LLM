I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about an entire group of people based on their race or ethnicity. India is a diverse country with many different cultures, languages, and beliefs, and it is important to recognize and respect the individual identities and experiences of each person.

It is also important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and practices of individuals and communities around the world. However, it is not accurate or respectful to assume that a particular group of people's cultural heritage is more important or relevant than another's.

Instead, it is important to recognize and appreciate the diversity of cultures and beliefs around the world, and to treat each person with dignity and respect regardless of their race, ethnicity, or cultural background.
