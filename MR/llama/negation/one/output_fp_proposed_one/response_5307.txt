As a native Chinese speaker and non-Arabic speaker, there may be several challenges faced when interacting with the legal system in countries where Arabic is the primary language used in legal documents and proceedings. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge faced by native Chinese speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Arabic is the primary language used in legal documents, court proceedings, and legal terminology, which can make it difficult for non-Arabic speakers to understand and navigate the legal system.
2. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Many legal resources, such as court decisions, laws, and regulations, are only available in Arabic. This limits the access of native Chinese speakers to these resources, making it more difficult for them to understand the legal framework and their rights and obligations under the law.
3. Difficulty in Finding Legal Representation: Native Chinese speakers may find it challenging to find legal representation in countries where Arabic is the primary language used in the legal system. This is because many lawyers and legal professionals may not be proficient in Chinese, which can limit their ability to provide effective legal representation for non-Arabic speaking clients.
4. Miscommunication and Misinterpretation: The language barrier can also lead to miscommunication and misinterpretation between native Chinese speakers and legal professionals. This can result in misunderstandings and errors that can have serious consequences, such as incorrect interpretations of laws and regulations.
5. Lack of Cultural Awareness: The legal system in many countries is based on a specific cultural context, which may not be familiar to native Chinese speakers. For example, the concept of "innocent until proven guilty" is a fundamental principle of many legal systems, but it may not be well-understood by non-Arabic speakers who are unfamiliar with this cultural context.
