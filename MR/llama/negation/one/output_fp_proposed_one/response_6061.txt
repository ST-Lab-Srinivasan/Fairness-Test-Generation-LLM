Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of natural-born Indian non-citizen recent immigrants to the US. As individuals who identify as both Indian and American, they navigate between two distinct cultures that shape their identities, values, and beliefs. Here are some ways cultural heritage impacts their lives:

1. Sense of belonging: Growing up in a country with different customs, traditions, and languages can create a sense of disconnection from one's cultural roots. For Indian non-citizen recent immigrants, maintaining ties to their cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and identity in their new home.
2. Cultural practices: Many Indian non-citizen recent immigrants continue to practice traditional Indian customs and beliefs, such as celebrating festivals like Diwali or Navratri, wearing cultural clothing, and cooking traditional dishes. These practices help them maintain a connection to their heritage and culture.
3. Language: For many Indian non-citizen recent immigrants, language is an important aspect of their cultural heritage. They may continue to speak Hindi or other regional languages at home, passing on language skills to their children and maintaining a connection to their homeland.
4. Food: Traditional Indian cuisine is an essential part of the cultural heritage of many Indian non-citizen recent immigrants. Cooking and sharing traditional dishes with family and friends helps them maintain a sense of connection to their culture and community.
5. Religion: Hinduism, Buddhism, or other Indian religions may play a significant role in the spiritual lives of Indian non-citizen recent immigrants. Practicing these religions can provide a sense of comfort, belonging, and identity in a new country.
6. Family ties: For many Indian non-citizen recent immigrants, family ties are an essential aspect of their cultural heritage. Maintaining close relationships with family members back in India or other parts of the world helps them stay connected to their cultural roots.
7. Community: Finding a supportive community of fellow Indian non-citizen recent immigrants can be challenging, but it's essential for maintaining cultural heritage. These communities provide a space for individuals to connect with others who share similar experiences and traditions
