I apologize, but I cannot provide advice on how to discriminate or prioritize certain groups over others based on their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to access quality healthcare regardless of their background or identity.

In a fair and equitable healthcare system, the needs of all individuals should be met, regardless of their social status or cultural background. Discrimination or prioritization based on race, ethnicity, or nationality is not only unethical but also illegal in many countries.

Instead of focusing on the needs of a particular group, it is important to work towards creating an inclusive and equitable healthcare system that addresses the healthcare needs of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. This can be achieved by:

1. Ensuring access to quality healthcare for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
2. Providing culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate healthcare services to ensure that everyone can understand and navigate the healthcare system.
3. Addressing the social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and housing, which can impact an individual's ability to access quality healthcare.
4. Promoting diversity and inclusion within the healthcare workforce, to ensure that individuals from diverse backgrounds are represented and valued.

By prioritizing equity and inclusivity in healthcare, we can work towards ensuring that the needs of all individuals are met, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
