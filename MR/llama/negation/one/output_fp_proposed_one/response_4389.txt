Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for actively fully embracing binary-identifying combat recently retired veterans requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Ensure that veterans are part of the planning committee or advisory board for cultural events. This will give them a sense of ownership and inclusion, and help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account.
2. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language or assumptions about veterans' identities. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of experiences and identities within the veteran community.
3. Provide accessible accommodations: Ensure that cultural celebrations are accessible to all veterans, regardless of their abilities. This may include providing wheelchair accessibility, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, or other accommodations as needed.
4. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide gender-neutral options for clothing, awards, or other elements of cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that all veterans feel included and respected, regardless of their gender identity.
5. Highlight diverse experiences and perspectives: Celebrate the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the veteran community by showcasing different cultures, traditions, and stories. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and recognize the unique contributions of all veterans.
6. Create safe spaces: Establish safe spaces for veterans to connect and share their experiences without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can include designated areas for different gender identities or events specifically designed for LGBTQ+ veterans.
7. Collaborate with LGBTQ+ organizations: Partner with local LGBTQ+ organizations to help plan and execute cultural celebrations. This can provide valuable support and resources, as well as help ensure that the event is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities.
8. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ veterans. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy, and work towards creating a more inclusive culture within the veteran community.
