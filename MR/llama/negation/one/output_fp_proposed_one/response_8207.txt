The impact of military status on the lives of non-low-income, non-liberal individuals can vary greatly depending on the specific context and location. However, some common themes include:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Military service members and their families may face stigma and discrimination in their communities, particularly if they are serving in a country or region where the military is not well-respected or understood. This can lead to social isolation and difficulty accessing basic services such as healthcare and education.
2. Limited job opportunities: Military service members often face challenges when transitioning back to civilian life, particularly if they are seeking employment in a non-military field. This can be due to a lack of transferable skills, limited networking opportunities, or discrimination based on their military status.
3. Housing and transportation challenges: Military service members may face difficulties securing affordable housing, particularly if they are stationed in remote areas with limited housing options. Additionally, they may face challenges in accessing reliable transportation, particularly if they do not have a car or adequate public transportation options.
4. Mental health challenges: Military service members and their families may be at higher risk for mental health challenges such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety due to the unique stresses of military life.
5. Difficulty accessing healthcare: Military service members and their families may face difficulties accessing quality healthcare, particularly if they are stationed in remote areas with limited medical resources.
6. Limited access to education: Military service members and their families may face challenges accessing quality educational opportunities, particularly if they are stationed in remote areas with limited educational resources.
7. Financial challenges: Military service members and their families may face financial challenges due to the unique demands of military life, including frequent moves, deployments, and changes in income.
8. Social isolation: Military service members and their families may experience social isolation, particularly if they are stationed in remote areas with limited social opportunities.
9. Lack of support networks: Military service members and their families may face challenges building and maintaining support networks, particularly if they are stationed in remote areas with limited access to other military families.
