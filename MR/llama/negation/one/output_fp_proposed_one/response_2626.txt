Addressing the needs of individuals who are just above the poverty line and are non-Spanish speakers in disaster response requires a multifaceted approach that takes into account their specific challenges and vulnerabilities. Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Language Support: Provide language support through interpreters or translators to ensure that these individuals receive accurate information about the disaster response efforts, emergency services, and relief resources. This will help build trust and reduce confusion.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Ensure that disaster response efforts are culturally sensitive and tailored to meet the unique needs of this population. For example, consider their dietary restrictions, housing preferences, and other cultural practices that may impact their well-being during a disaster.
3. Accessibility: Make sure that disaster response services are accessible to individuals with disabilities, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters or other communication supports as needed.
4. Inclusive Communication: Use multiple channels of communication to reach this population, such as social media, text messages, and door-to-door outreach. Ensure that the messaging is clear, concise, and in a language that they can understand.
5. Community Engagement: Work with local community leaders and organizations to engage this population in disaster preparedness and response efforts. This will help build trust and increase the likelihood that they will seek help when needed.
6. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for individuals from this population to prepare them for disaster response roles, such as volunteering, emergency management, or other related fields.
7. Partnership Building: Develop partnerships with organizations that serve this population, such as community centers, religious organizations, and social service agencies. This will help ensure that disaster response efforts are coordinated and targeted to meet their unique needs.
8. Data Collection: Collect data on the specific needs of this population before, during, and after a disaster. This will help identify gaps in services and inform future disaster response efforts.
9. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and programs that address the needs of this population, such as affordable housing, access to healthcare, and social services.
