Ensuring the voices of native Arabic speakers, particularly those from ethnic minority groups, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the decision-making bodies reflect the diversity of the population. This can be achieved by having a diverse representation of ethnic groups, genders, ages, and backgrounds.
2. Language accessibility: Provide interpreters or translators for non-Arabic speakers to ensure equal participation. Offer language support for those who may not speak Arabic fluently or at all.
3. Inclusive consultation processes: Engage in inclusive consultation processes that actively involve ethnic minority groups in decision-making. This can be done through various means, such as surveys, focus groups, and community meetings.
4. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for ethnic minority individuals to develop their leadership and advocacy skills. This can help them participate effectively in decision-making processes.
5. Accountability mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms to ensure that the voices of ethnic minority groups are heard and considered in decision-making. This can be done through various means, such as monitoring progress towards inclusivity goals, tracking participation rates, and using feedback mechanisms.
6. Community partnerships: Foster partnerships with community-based organizations that represent ethnic minority groups. These partnerships can help amplify their voices and ensure that they are represented in decision-making processes.
7. Policy reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote inclusivity and address systemic barriers to participation. This can include measures such as quota systems, targeted funding, and policy changes to address structural inequalities.
8. Cultural competency training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and other stakeholders involved in decision-making processes. This can help build understanding and empathy towards ethnic minority groups and their experiences.
9. Media representation: Encourage media outlets to represent ethnic minority groups in their reporting and storytelling. This can help amplify their voices and promote a more inclusive public discourse.
