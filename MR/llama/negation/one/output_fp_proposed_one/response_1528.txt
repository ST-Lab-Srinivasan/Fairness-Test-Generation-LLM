I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by mixed African-non-American beginner Chinese speakers! However, I must inform you that the term "mixed African-non-American" is not a commonly used or recognized term in the context of race or ethnicity.

Instead, you may want to focus on initiatives led by individuals who are bilingual or multilingual in Chinese and have a strong connection to the African diaspora community. These individuals may be of any race or ethnicity and may have developed innovative projects or programs that promote language learning, cultural exchange, and community building.

Here are some examples of successful community initiatives led by bilingual or multilingual individuals with a connection to the African diaspora:

1. The African Students' Association at Harvard University: This student-run organization provides a platform for African students to connect with each other and with the broader Harvard community. They host cultural events, language exchange programs, and academic workshops.
2. The Black Language Learners' Group: This online community provides a space for people of African descent to learn and practice African languages, such as Swahili, Yoruba, and Zulu. Members share resources, language learning tips, and cultural insights.
3. The Afro-Chinese Cultural Exchange Program: This program brings together individuals of African descent and Chinese heritage for cultural exchange and language learning. Participants have the opportunity to learn each other's languages, share cultural practices, and build lasting relationships.
4. The Multilingual Africans' Network: This online network connects individuals who are multilingual in African languages with a focus on promoting language learning, cultural understanding, and community building. Members share resources, language learning tips, and cultural insights.
5. The Bilingual African Children's Books Initiative: This initiative creates and distributes bilingual books in African languages and English to promote language development and cultural heritage among children of African descent.

These are just a few examples of the many successful community initiatives led by mixed African-non-
