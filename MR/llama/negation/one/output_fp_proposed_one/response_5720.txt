Ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-Arabic speaking populations in the UAE are met can be challenging due to language barriers. However, there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Provide interpretation services: Hospitals and clinics can provide interpretation services for non-Arabic speakers, such as hiring interpreters or using telephone interpretation services. This will ensure that patients receive accurate information about their diagnosis, treatment, and medication instructions.
2. Offer translated materials: Healthcare providers can translate their materials into multiple languages, including English, Hindi, Urdu, and other languages spoken by non-Arabic speakers in the UAE. This can include patient brochures, consent forms, and discharge instructions.
