As a non-native English speaker, I can attest to the challenges faced by individuals who are not fluent in French in the legal system. Here are some of the common difficulties encountered:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge is the language barrier itself. Legal terminology and concepts can be complex and difficult to understand, especially for those who are not familiar with English. This can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations, which can have serious consequences in legal proceedings.
2. Limited access to resources: Non-French speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as dictionaries, law books, and online databases. This can make it difficult for them to research and understand legal concepts and terminology.
3. Difficulty navigating the court system: The French court system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with the language and culture. Non-French speakers may have difficulty navigating the system, finding their way around courthouses, and understanding legal procedures.

This can lead to feelings of frustration and anxiety, which can negatively impact their ability to navigate the legal system.
6. Difficulty understanding court documents: Legal documents, such as contracts and court orders, are often written in French. Non-French speakers may have difficulty understanding these documents, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

8. Difficulty navigating cultural differences: The French legal system has its own unique cultural and historical context, which can be challenging for non-French speakers to navigate. For example
