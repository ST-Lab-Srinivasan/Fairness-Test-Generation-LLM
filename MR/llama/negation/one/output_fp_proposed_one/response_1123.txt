2. Access to capital: Address the lack of access to capital for marginalized communities by providing financial resources, investment opportunities, and support for entrepreneurship.
3. Networking and mentorship: Connect individuals from diverse backgrounds with mentors and peers who can provide guidance, support, and opportunities for collaboration.
