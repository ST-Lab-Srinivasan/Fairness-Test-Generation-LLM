Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-permanent resident moderate individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct research to better understand the needs, preferences, and accessibility requirements of non-permanent residents. This can involve surveys, focus groups, or interviews to gather insights into their cultural experiences and expectations.

8. Offer language support: Provide interpreters or translation services during the events to help non-permanent residents who may not speak the dominant language of the host country.
