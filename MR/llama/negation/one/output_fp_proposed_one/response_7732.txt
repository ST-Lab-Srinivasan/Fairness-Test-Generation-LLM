Creating more inclusive cultural programs for individuals who are not deeply in poverty but still face socio-economic barriers can be achieved through a combination of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural program is accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation. Offer affordable ticket prices or free admission for those who cannot afford it.
