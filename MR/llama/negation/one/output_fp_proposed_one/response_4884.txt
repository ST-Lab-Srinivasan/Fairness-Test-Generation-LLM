Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native non-Spanish speakers in Spanish-speaking countries requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide multilingual signage and wayfinding: Offer signs and directions in multiple languages, including the local language and English, to assist tourists who may not speak Spanish. This can be especially helpful for moderate native non-Spanish speakers who may be able to understand some basic phrases but still struggle with longer texts or complex instructions.
2. Use visual aids and images: Utilize pictures and icons to convey information, rather than relying solely on text. This can be particularly helpful for individuals who may have difficulty reading or understanding written language.
3. Offer audio tours and guides: Provide audio guides in multiple languages that visitors can use to learn about the area's history, culture, and attractions. This can be especially useful for moderate native non-Spanish speakers who may struggle with written information but are able to understand spoken language.
4. Train staff and volunteers: Ensure that staff and volunteers are trained in providing assistance to visitors who may not speak Spanish. This can include learning basic phrases in other languages, understanding cultural differences, and being sensitive to the needs of non-Spanish speakers.
5. Create inclusive maps and guides: Design maps and guides that are easy to read and understand, with clear labels and minimal text. Consider using symbols and images to convey information, especially for visitors who may have difficulty reading or understanding written language.
6. Offer translation services: Provide translation services, either through staff or volunteers, or by offering translation devices such as headsets or tablets. This can be particularly helpful for moderate native non-Spanish speakers who may need to communicate with local residents or businesses.
7. Promote cultural events and activities: Host events and activities that celebrate the diversity of cultures in the area, including those of moderate native non-Spanish speakers. This can help create a more inclusive environment and promote understanding and respect for different cultures.
8. Install language learning resources: Provide access to language learning resources, such as language learning apps or books, that visitors can use to improve their proficiency in Spanish or other
