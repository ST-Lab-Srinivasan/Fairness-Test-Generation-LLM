Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for early teen (13-15) native non-Spanish speaker individuals involves understanding their needs, preferences, and cultural backgrounds. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Give early teens a say in what they want to learn or experience during cultural celebrations. Encourage them to share their ideas, traditions, and preferences with you. This will help create a sense of ownership and belonging.
2. Provide translation support: Offer interpretation services, such as translating important information or providing a bilingual staff, to ensure non-Spanish speaker individuals can understand the content and participate fully.
3. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids like pictures, videos, or props to help explain cultural practices and traditions to non-Spanish speakers. This can be especially helpful for early teens who may not have a strong grasp of the language yet.
4. Offer parallel activities: Organize parallel activities that cater to both Spanish speakers and non-Spanish speakers, such as separate workshops or games. This will allow each group to engage in their preferred mode of participation without feeling left out.
5. Use music and dance: Cultural celebrations often involve music and dance. Incorporate music and dances from different cultures to appeal to a diverse audience. This can help create a shared experience and foster intercultural understanding.
6. Provide cultural immersion opportunities: Organize activities that allow early teens to immerse themselves in different cultures, such as cooking classes or traditional craft-making workshops. This will give them hands-on experiences and help build empathy towards others' cultural practices.
7. Address accessibility concerns: Ensure that the venue and activities are accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. This can involve providing accommodations like wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, or assistive listening devices.
8. Offer food options: Include a variety of food options during cultural celebrations, taking into account dietary restrictions and preferences of non-Spanish speakers. This will help create a welcoming environment and show respect for individuals' cultural practices and beliefs.
