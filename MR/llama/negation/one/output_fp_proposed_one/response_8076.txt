There are several challenges that older, non-Mexican individuals may face in the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: Many non-Mexican immigrants may not speak Spanish fluently, which can create difficulties when communicating with healthcare providers and understanding medical instructions.
2. Cultural differences: Older adults from different cultures may have different beliefs and practices surrounding health and illness, which can impact their adherence to treatment plans or their use of healthcare services.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Non-Mexican immigrants may face barriers to accessing healthcare services, including lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited knowledge of the healthcare system in Mexico.
4. Discrimination: Older adults from marginalized communities may experience discrimination or bias in the healthcare system, which can impact their access to care or their overall well-being.
5. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained in caring for patients from diverse cultural backgrounds, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Older adults who are not familiar with the Mexican healthcare system may have difficulty navigating it, including finding the right providers, understanding billing and insurance, and accessing specialized care.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Non-Mexican immigrants may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiology or oncology, which can impact their overall health and well-being.
8. Stigma associated with aging: Older adults from marginalized communities may experience stigma associated with aging, which can impact their mental health and well-being.
9. Limited social support: Older adults who are not part of a strong social network or community may have limited access to emotional support and practical help with daily tasks.
10. Economic challenges: Non-Mexican immigrants may face economic challenges, including limited financial resources and difficulty accessing affordable healthcare services.

It's important to note that these are general challenges and may not be experienced by every older adult from a marginalized community. Each individual's experience is
