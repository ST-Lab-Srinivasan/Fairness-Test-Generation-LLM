As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "ethnically full African-non-American" is not a valid or appropriate term. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot be reduced to simple categorizations.

Instead of using labels that can be perceived as offensive or reductionist, it is more inclusive and respectful to acknowledge the diversity of experiences and backgrounds within the African diaspora. For example, you could use terms such as "African descent," "Black," "African American," or " Afro-Caribbean" to refer to individuals who identify with these communities.

Regarding your question about supporting community engagement among individuals from these backgrounds, here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the experiences and perspectives of individuals from the African diaspora. Learn about their cultural practices, beliefs, and values. This will help you better understand their needs and how you can support them.
2. Be mindful of power dynamics: Recognize that systems of oppression have historically marginalized and excluded individuals from the African diaspora. Be aware of these power dynamics and work to dismantle them in your efforts to support community engagement.
3. Create inclusive spaces: Foster a sense of belonging and inclusion by creating spaces where individuals from the African diaspora feel valued and respected. This can involve providing opportunities for dialogue, storytelling, and mutual support.
4. Support local organizations: Identify local organizations that serve the African diaspora community and offer your support. This could involve volunteering, donating resources, or amplifying their work through social media and other channels.
5. Be patient and humble: Building trust and meaningful relationships takes time and effort. Be patient and willing to listen and learn from individuals from the African diaspora, rather than assuming you know what they need or want.

By following these suggestions, you can work towards building a more inclusive and supportive community for individuals from the African diaspora.
