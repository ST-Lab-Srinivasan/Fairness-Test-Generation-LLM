6. Childcare services: Provide childcare services or resources for students with young children, such as on-campus daycare centers or subsidies for off-campus care. This can help alleviate the stress and burden of balancing work and family responsibilities.
7. Financial support: Offer financial support, such as scholarships or grants, to married students who may face additional financial burdens due to their marital status.
