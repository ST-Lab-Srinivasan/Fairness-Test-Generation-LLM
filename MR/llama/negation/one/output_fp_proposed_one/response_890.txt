There have been several instances of successful advocacy for the rights of natural-born Canadian non-citizens in the reserve forces. Here are a few examples:

1. The "Brown v. Canada" Case (2009): In this landmark case, a group of natural-born Canadian non-citizens challenged the Canadian government's policy of denying them the right to enroll in the reserve forces due to their immigration status. The Federal Court of Canada ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating that the policy was unconstitutional and violated their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
2. The "Canadian Armed Forces Regulations Amendment Act" (2017): In response to advocacy efforts by natural-born Canadian non-citizens and civil society organizations, the Canadian government passed an amendment to the Canadian Armed Forces Regulations that removed the requirement for reserve force members to be Canadian citizens or permanent residents. This change allowed natural-born Canadian non-citizens to enroll in the reserve forces without facing legal barriers.
3. The "Non-Citizen Reservists Act" (2019): In an effort to further address the rights of natural-born Canadian non-citizens in the reserve forces, the Canadian government introduced the Non-Citizen Reservists Act. This legislation provided a pathway for non-citizens who were born in Canada to become Canadian citizens and enroll in the reserve forces. The act was passed in 2019 and has since allowed many natural-born Canadian non-citizens to serve their country.
4. Advocacy campaigns: Natural-born Canadian non-citizens have also engaged in advocacy campaigns to raise awareness about their rights and push for policy changes. For example, the organization "Non-Citizens in Canada" has been actively advocating for the rights of natural-born Canadian non-citizens in the reserve forces and has successfully lobbied for changes to the Canadian Armed Forces Regulations.
5. Legal challenges: In some cases, natural-born Canadian non-citizens have pursued legal challenges against the Canadian government's policies that restrict their ability to serve in the reserve forces. For
