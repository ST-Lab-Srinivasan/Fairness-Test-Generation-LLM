Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speaker immigrant non-citizen individuals in the US involves understanding their unique needs and preferences, tailoring the programs to their level of proficiency, and providing a supportive environment. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Assess the audience's language proficiency: Beginner Arabic speakers may have varying levels of comprehension and expression. Evaluate the audience's language skills to design programs that cater to their needs, such as offering beginner-friendly content or providing simultaneous interpretation in Arabic.
2. Use culturally relevant and inclusive materials: Choose cultural programs that reflect the immigrant community's background and experiences.

7. Incorporate intergenerational activities: Engage both younger and older members of the immigrant community by offering programs that cater to different age groups. For example, host events that bring together children and elders, fostering cross-
