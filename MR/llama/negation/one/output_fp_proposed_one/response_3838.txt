As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular racial or ethnic group. The experiences of early teenagers (13-15 years old) in the legal system can vary greatly depending on their individual circumstances and the specific laws and policies in place in their jurisdiction.

However, I can provide some general information on the challenges that may be faced by early teenagers who are ethnically full African non-Americans in the legal system:
