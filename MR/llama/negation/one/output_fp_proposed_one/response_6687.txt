1. Encourage and Support: Encourage the individual to pursue their educational aspirations and offer your support throughout the process. Be a sounding board for their ideas and concerns, and provide emotional support during challenging times.
2. Language Learning Resources: Provide access to language learning resources such as textbooks, language learning apps, or online courses that cater to their level of proficiency. You can also find local language exchange programs or tutors who can help them improve their English skills.
3. Practice with Them: Practice speaking and listening to English with the individual on a regular basis. This will help them improve their pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. You can also play language learning games together, such as vocabulary building or sentence structuring exercises.

8. Offer Help with Coursework: If the individual is enrolled in an English course or program, offer to help them with their coursework or provide support in completing assignments. This will help them stay on track and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
9. Encourage Self-
