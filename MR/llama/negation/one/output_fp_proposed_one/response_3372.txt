Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for Native and recent immigrants to the US, who are devout non-Christians, requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and acknowledge their beliefs: Take the time to learn about the beliefs, values, and practices of the non-Christian communities you aim to include in your cultural celebrations. This will help you design events that are meaningful and inclusive.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Invite members of these communities to participate in the planning and organizing of cultural celebrations. This will ensure that their beliefs and practices are taken into account and that they feel valued and included.
3. Be mindful of language and symbolism: Use language and symbols that are respectful and inclusive of all cultures. Avoid using terms or symbols that may be offensive or exclusive to any particular group.
4. Offer a variety of food options: Provide a range of food options that cater to the diverse dietary needs and preferences of attendees. This could include vegetarian, vegan, halal, kosher, and other options.

9. Celebrate and learn from each other: Use cultural celebrations as an opportunity to learn about and celebrate the diverse beliefs and practices of attendees. This
