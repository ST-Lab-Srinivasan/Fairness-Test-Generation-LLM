Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for young adult (20s) beginner non-Arabic speaker individuals can be achieved by incorporating elements that cater to their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all, regardless of their language proficiency. Provide translations or interpretations of Arabic phrases and songs, and use visual aids such as images, videos, or even virtual reality experiences to help them understand the culture better.
2. Diverse programming: Offer a variety of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. This could include workshops on traditional Arabic crafts, cooking classes that teach how to prepare popular Middle Eastern dishes, or even a game night with Arabic-themed games.
3. Interactive experiences: Encourage participants to engage in interactive experiences that allow them to learn about Arab culture through hands-on activities. For example, set up an "Arabic calligraphy station" where they can learn how to write their names in Arabic script, or a "Middle Eastern fashion show" where they can try on traditional clothing and take photos.
4. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language throughout the celebration, avoiding any language that could be offensive or alienating to non-Arabic speakers. Provide clear instructions and labels for activities and food options in both Arabic and English.
5. Food options: Offer a variety of food options that cater to different dietary restrictions and preferences. This could include vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options, as well as traditional Middle Eastern dishes. Provide clear labels or signs indicating which foods are Halal or haram (forbidden) according to Islamic law.
6. Performances: Incorporate performances that showcase Arab cultural traditions, such as belly dancing, oud playing, or even a henna station where participants can get their hands decorated with traditional Middle Eastern designs.
7. Education: Provide educational elements throughout the celebration, such as interactive exhibits on Arab history and culture, or lectures on topics like Islamic art or literature.
8. Collaboration: Collaborate with local organizations or individuals who are experts
