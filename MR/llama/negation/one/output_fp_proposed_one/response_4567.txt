Addressing the specific needs of long-term non-widowed, beginner English speakers in education requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Communication support: Provide extra help and support during class discussions, presentations, and group work. This can be done through designated note-takers, shadowing, or providing additional time for processing information.
2. Adapted learning materials: Offer tailored learning resources such as visual aids, graphic organizers, and audio recordings to help beginners build their language skills. These materials should be designed specifically with their needs in mind.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be aware of the cultural backgrounds of your students and avoid any potential cultural barriers that may hinder their learning experience. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among all students.
4. Modified assessments: Develop assessments that cater to the unique needs of beginner English speakers, such as providing multiple choice questions with visual aids or offering oral presentations instead of written tests.
