People with non-Hispanic and mixed Hispanic ancestry may face specific difficulties in the healthcare system. These include: 

1. Misdiagnosis or inaccurate diagnosis: Due to a lack of understanding about their cultural background, they might be misdiagnosed or receive an incorrect diagnosis, which could result in poor treatment outcomes.
2. Language barriers: For those who speak limited English, communicating with healthcare providers can be challenging. This might make it difficult for them to express their symptoms or ask questions about their medical condition.
3. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare professionals may not fully understand the cultural beliefs and practices that influence a person's health care decisions, leading to inappropriate or insensitive treatment.
4. Distrust: Due to historical trauma or ongoing discrimination, some mixed-race Hispanic people might feel uncomfortable or mistrustful of the medical system. This could lead them to avoid getting necessary care or delay seeking treatment.
5. Inadequate representation: Mixed-race Hispanics may not see themselves represented in the healthcare workforce, which can contribute to a sense of isolation or marginalization.
6. Lack of access to culturally competent providers: Some mixed-race Hispanic people might face difficulties accessing healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about their cultural background and can provide appropriate care.
7. Stigma and shame: Intersectional identities like race, ethnicity, and gender can be complex and stigmatized, leading to feelings of shame or inadequacy when navigating the healthcare system. This could cause them to avoid seeking medical attention or disclose personal information to their healthcare provider.
8. Limited access to culturally specific health resources: Mixed-race Hispanics might have limited access to cultural-specific health resources, such as community clinics or organizations catering to their particular needs.
9. Lack of cultural sensitivity in medical education: Healthcare providers may not receive adequate training in cross-cultural communication and understanding, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication with mixed-race Hispanic patients.
10. Inadequate policy and advocacy
