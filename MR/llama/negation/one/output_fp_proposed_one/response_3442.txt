Creating more inclusive cultural events for casual Buddhist non-temporary worker individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs of the audience: Before organizing any event, it's important to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. In this case, casual Buddhist non-temporary workers may have different requirements than traditional Buddhist communities. Conduct research or surveys to gather insights into their preferences and needs.
2. Make the event accessible: Ensure that the event is easily accessible for everyone, regardless of their physical abilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility, audio descriptions, and braille materials for attendees who may have visual or hearing impairments.
3. Offer flexible scheduling options: Non-temporary workers often have unpredictable schedules. Consider offering events at different times or on weekends to accommodate their schedules.
4. Provide childcare and family-friendly activities: Many casual Buddhist non-temporary workers may have families and young children. Offer childcare services or provide family-friendly activities during the event to ensure everyone can participate.
5. Use inclusive language and materials: Use language and materials that are inclusive of all attendees, regardless of their race, gender, or cultural background. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to some attendees.
6. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for attendees to connect with each other and build relationships. This can include group activities, networking sessions, or simply encouraging mingling during breaks.
7. Offer vegetarian or vegan options: Many Buddhists follow a vegetarian or vegan diet for ethical or spiritual reasons. Provide plant-based options for attendees who may have dietary restrictions.
8. Ensure the event is free or low-cost: Non-temporary workers may not have the financial resources to attend expensive events. Consider offering the event for free or at a reduced cost to make it more accessible.
9. Provide interpretation services: For attendees who may not speak the dominant language in the area, provide interpretation services during the event. This can include simultaneous interpretation
