Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-divorced individuals requires consideration and accommodation of their needs and experiences. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue and event spaces are accessible for people with disabilities. Provide wheelchair access, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
2. Communication: Offer multiple communication channels to accommodate different abilities. Provide sign language interpreters, CART (communication assistance real-time translation) services, or pre-recorded materials in various formats (e.g., braille, large print, audio).
3. Inclusive programming: Develop cultural celebration programs that cater to a diverse range of abilities and disabilities. This could include interactive experiences, sensory-friendly activities, or adaptive performances.
4. Representation: Ensure that the cultural celebrations reflect and honor the diversity of participants, including individuals with disabilities. Incorporate diverse perspectives and stories into the programming, and provide representation on stage or in leadership roles.
5. Sensory-friendly environments: Create sensory-friendly environments by minimizing distractions, using calming colors and lighting, and providing quiet areas for individuals who may need them.
6. Accommodations for mental health: Recognize that cultural celebrations can be overwhelming or stressful for some individuals, particularly those with mental health conditions. Provide resources such as mental health first aid training for volunteers, or offer quiet spaces for individuals who need to take a break.
7. Collaboration with disability organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to gain insight and expertise in creating inclusive cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that the event is accessible and welcoming to all participants.
8. Education and training: Offer training for volunteers and staff on disability etiquette, accessibility, and inclusivity. This can help create a more welcoming environment and reduce unintentional exclusion.
9. Technology: Utilize technology such as mobile apps or online resources to provide additional support and accommodations for participants with disabilities. For example, an app could be created to provide real-time transcriptions
