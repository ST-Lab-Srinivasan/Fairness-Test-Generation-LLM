The impact of marital status on the lives of natural-born US non-citizens with children can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to benefits: Married individuals may have better access to benefits such as health insurance, tax credits, and social security benefits compared to unmarried individuals. This can be particularly important for low-income families who may rely on these benefits to make ends meet.
2. Legal rights and responsibilities: Marriage grants legal rights and responsibilities to both partners, including inheritance, tax benefits, and decision-making authority in medical emergencies. Unmarried parents may face challenges in obtaining legal recognition of their parental rights, particularly if they are not the biological father.
3. Social stigma: Unmarried individuals, especially those with children, may face social stigma and discrimination. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can have a negative impact on mental health and well-being.
4. Child custody disputes: In the event of a divorce or separation, unmarried parents may face challenges in obtaining legal custody of their children. This can be particularly difficult if they are not the biological father, as they may need to prove their paternity and demonstrate their ability to care for the child.
5. Immigration status: Non-citizen parents may face additional challenges in securing legal residency or citizenship for themselves and their children. This can be particularly complex if they are unmarried, as they may not have access to the same legal avenues as married couples.
6. Employment and financial stability: Unmarried parents may face challenges in obtaining stable employment and financial security, particularly if they do not have access to benefits such as health insurance or tax credits. This can be particularly difficult for low-income families who may rely on these benefits to make ends meet.
7. Housing instability: Unmarried parents may face challenges in securing stable housing, particularly if they do not have access to affordable housing options. This can lead to housing insecurity and instability, which can have a negative impact on mental health and well-being.
8. Educational outcomes: Children of unmarried parents
