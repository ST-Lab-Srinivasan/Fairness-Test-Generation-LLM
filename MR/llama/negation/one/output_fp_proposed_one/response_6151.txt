As a native Chinese speaker who is also a US non-citizen, there are several challenges you may face when interacting with the legal system in the United States. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: As a non-native English speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively with legal professionals and officials who only speak English. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulties in navigating the legal system.
2. Cultural Differences: Chinese culture is often very different from American culture, and these differences can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or conflicts when dealing with the legal system.
