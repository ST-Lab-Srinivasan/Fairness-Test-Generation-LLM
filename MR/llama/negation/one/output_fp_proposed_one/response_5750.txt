Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-Chinese speaker individuals who are newly married or have been married for a relatively short period of time. Here are some ways cultural heritage can influence their identities:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For non-Chinese speaker individuals who are married to Chinese partners, embracing their spouse's cultural heritage can help them feel more connected to their in-laws and the larger Chinese community.

3. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can play a significant role in shaping an individual's identity, especially during the early stages of marriage. By embracing their spouse's cultural heritage, non-Chinese speaker individuals may feel more confident in their own identity and sense of self.
