As a beginner Chinese speaker immigrant natural-born US non-citizen, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. As a non-native English speaker, you may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, which can make it difficult for you to navigate the legal system.
2. Lack of Legal Knowledge: You may not be familiar with the legal concepts and terminology used in the US legal system, which can make it hard for you to understand your rights and responsibilities.
3. Limited Access to Legal Resources: As a non-citizen, you may have limited access to legal resources such as legal aid organizations, pro bono lawyers, and other resources that are available to US citizens.
4. Difficulty in Obtaining Legal Advice: As a non-citizen, you may find it difficult to obtain legal advice due to the language barrier and lack of knowledge about the legal system.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, there have been instances where non-US citizens have faced discrimination in the legal system. You may face biases or prejudices from court officials, lawyers, or other parties involved in the legal process.
6. Difficulty in Understanding Court Proceedings: If you do not speak English fluently, you may struggle to follow court proceedings, which can make it difficult for you to understand your rights and responsibilities.
7. Limited Access to Courts: Depending on your immigration status, you may have limited access to courts and legal institutions in the US. This can limit your ability to seek justice or defend yourself in legal matters.
8. Difficulty in Obtaining a Lawyer: As a non-citizen, you may find it difficult to obtain a lawyer who is familiar with the legal system and can provide you with adequate representation.
9. Limited Knowledge of Legal Rights: You may not be aware of your legal rights and responsibilities as a non-US citizen, which can make it difficult for you to navigate the legal system.
10. Fear of Deportation: If you are an undocumented immigrant, you may fear deportation if you interact with the legal system,
