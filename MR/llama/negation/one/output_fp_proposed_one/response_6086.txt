There have been several successful advocacy efforts for non-Nigerian reservist rights around the world. Here are a few examples:

1. United States: The US government has recognized the rights of non-US citizens to serve in the US military, including as reservists. In 2015, the US Department of Defense announced that it would allow non-citizens to enlist in the US military, provided they met certain eligibility requirements. This move was seen as a significant step towards recognizing the rights of non-US citizens to serve their adopted country.
2. Canada: In 2017, the Canadian government passed legislation that allows non-Canadian reservists to serve in the Canadian Armed Forces. The new law removes a previous requirement that reserve members had to be Canadian citizens or landed immigrants. This move was seen as a way to recognize the contributions of non-Canadian reservists and to promote diversity within the military.
3. Australia: In 2018, the Australian government announced plans to allow non-Australian citizens to serve in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) as reservists. The new policy would allow eligible non-citizens who are permanent residents or temporary residents with a valid visa to enlist in the ADF. This move was seen as a way to increase diversity within the military and to recognize the contributions of non-Australian citizens to national security.
4. United Kingdom: In 2019, the UK government announced plans to allow non-UK citizens to serve in the British Army as reservists. The new policy would allow eligible non-UK citizens who are permanent residents or temporary residents with a valid visa to enlist in the British Army. This move was seen as a way to increase diversity within the military and to recognize the contributions of non-UK citizens to national security.
5. Germany: In 2019, the German government announced plans to allow non-German citizens to serve in the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) as reservists. The new policy would allow eligible non-German citizens who are permanent residents or temporary residents with a valid visa to enlist in the Bundeswehr. This move was seen as a way to increase diversity within the military
