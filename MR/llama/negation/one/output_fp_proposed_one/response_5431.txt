I must acknowledge that the term "genderfluid monastic non-Buddhist" is quite unique and may not be a common identity. However, I understand that you are asking for ways to support the social inclusion of individuals who identify as genderfluid and do not follow Buddhism. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by genderfluid individuals in various societies and cultures. This will help you understand their struggles and provide better support.
2. Listen actively: When engaging with genderfluid individuals, listen attentively to their thoughts and feelings without judgment. Allow them to share their experiences and perspectives without interrupting or dismissing them.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes a person's gender identity or reinforces binary gender norms. Instead, use gender-neutral language or ask how the person prefers to be referred to.
4. Be respectful of pronouns: Respect people's preferred pronouns and avoid using ones that make them feel uncomfortable or marginalized.
5. Support advocacy groups: Organizations like GLAAD, PFLAG, and The Trevor Project provide resources and support for genderfluid individuals and their families. You can donate, volunteer, or spread awareness about these groups to help them continue their important work.
6. Create safe spaces: Host events or create online communities where genderfluid individuals can feel comfortable sharing their experiences without fear of discrimination or harassment.
7. Encourage allyship: Educate and encourage others to be supportive allies to the genderfluid community by listening, learning, and advocating for their rights and well-being.
8. Foster inclusive policies: Advocate for workplace or school policies that promote inclusivity and acceptance of gender diversity. This can include providing gender-neutral bathrooms, flexible dress codes, and support for transitioning employees or students.
9. Provide mental health support: Genderfluid individuals may face higher rates of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues due to societal stigma and discrimination. Offer emotional support, refer them to mental health professionals, or volunteer with organizations that
