As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the legal system is complex and multifaceted, and there are various challenges that native English speakers and non-Arabic speakers may face. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge faced by non-Arabic speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Arabic is the official language of many countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and it can be difficult for non-native speakers to understand and navigate the legal system without a good command of the language.
2. Cultural Differences: Each country has its own unique cultural context, which can affect the way the legal system operates. Non-Arabic speakers may find it challenging to understand the local customs, traditions, and values that influence the legal system.
3. Unfamiliarity with Local Laws: Non-Arabic speakers may not be familiar with the specific laws and regulations of the country they are dealing with. This lack of knowledge can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations, which can have serious consequences in a legal context.
4. Limited Access to Legal Resources: In some countries, non-Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, interpreters, and legal documents. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and assert their rights.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-Arabic speakers may face discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are not familiar with the local language and customs. This can lead to unfair treatment and a lack of access to justice.
6. Lack of Trust: Non-Arabic speakers may have difficulty building trust with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who are not fluent in their native language. This can make it harder for them to communicate their needs and concerns effectively.
7. Limited Legal Protection: Depending on the country, non-Arabic speakers may not have the same legal protections as Arabic speakers. This can leave them vulnerable to discrimination and mistreatment in the legal system.
8. Difficulty in Finding Pro Bono Legal Services: Non-Arab
