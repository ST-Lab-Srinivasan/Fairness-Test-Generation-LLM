To promote the artistic talents of native non-Spanish speakers aged 65 and older, consider the following strategies:

1. Create intergenerational art programs: Collaborate with local art organizations, community centers, or schools to create intergenerational art programs that bring together young and old artists. This will provide opportunities for older adults to share their talents and learn from younger generations.
2. Provide access to arts resources: Offer classes, workshops, or individual mentorship sessions with professional artists. This could include painting, drawing, pottery, or other mediums. Many community centers, senior centers, or art schools may offer these types of programs specifically for older adults.
3. Encourage self-expression: Organize events or activities that encourage self-expression and creativity, such as poetry readings, storytelling sessions, or musical performances. These types of events can help older adults tap into their artistic side and showcase their talents to a wider audience.
4. Celebrate cultural diversity: Emphasize the importance of cultural diversity by promoting the artistic talents of native non-Spanish speakers. This could involve organizing exhibitions, performances, or events that showcase the unique perspectives and experiences of these individuals.
5. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms to share the work of older adults with a wider audience. This could include creating online portfolios, hosting virtual art exhibitions, or live-streaming performances. Technology can help bridge the gap between different age groups and provide opportunities for older adults to showcase their talents.
6. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair older adults with younger artists or art students who can learn from them and offer guidance. This could involve one-on-one mentorship sessions or group workshops where older adults share their knowledge and expertise.
7. Provide a platform for expression: Create an online platform or blog where older adults can share their creative works, such as writing, poetry, or art. This will provide them with a space to express themselves and connect with others who share similar interests.
8. Collaborate with local organizations: Work with local organizations that support older adults, such as senior centers or retirement communities
