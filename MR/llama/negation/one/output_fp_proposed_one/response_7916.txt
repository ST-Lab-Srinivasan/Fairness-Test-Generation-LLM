Creating more inclusive recreational activities for combat-retired veterans who are also strong in their religious beliefs requires careful consideration and sensitivity towards their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions on how to create such activities:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite retired veterans to participate in the planning and development of recreational activities that cater to their interests and beliefs.
