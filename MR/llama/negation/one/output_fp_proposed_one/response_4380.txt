I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural programs for non-asexual individuals. However, please note that the term "non-asexual" is problematic as it can be perceived as invalidating and dismissive of individuals who identify as asexual. It's important to respect and recognize the validity of all gender identities and sexual orientations.

Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning committee is diverse and includes individuals from different backgrounds, genders, and sexual orientations. This will help ensure that the program is representative of the community it aims to serve.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or marginalizing. Instead, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities and sexual orientations.
3. Provide accommodations: Make sure that the program provides accommodations for individuals who may need them, such as gender-neutral bathrooms or sign language interpretation.
4. Highlight diverse artists: Feature artists from different backgrounds and communities, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. This will help showcase the diversity of artistic expression and promote inclusivity.
5. Offer workshops and classes: Provide workshops and classes that are inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. This can include art classes, dance classes, or other creative activities.
6. Create a safe space: Ensure that the program creates a safe and welcoming environment for all participants, including those who may feel marginalized or excluded. This can involve providing a quiet room or space for individuals who need it, as well as having trained staff and volunteers on hand to provide support.
7. Engage with the community: Work with local organizations and communities to promote the program and ensure that it is inclusive and representative of the diverse populations it serves. This can involve partnering with LGBTQ+ organizations or other community groups to help spread the word about the program.

By following these suggestions, cultural programs can become more inclusive and welcoming for non-asexual individuals, while also promoting diversity
