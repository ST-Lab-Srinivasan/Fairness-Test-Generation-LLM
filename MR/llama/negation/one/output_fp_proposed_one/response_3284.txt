The impact of marital status on the lives of native non-French speaker men can vary significantly. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Married men may experience social isolation, especially if their spouse is not from the same culture or country as them. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their community.
2. Loss of identity: Men who marry non-French women may feel a loss of identity, particularly if they have been living in France for a long time and have developed a strong sense of French culture and identity.
3. Cultural differences: Marriage to a non-French speaker can create cultural differences within the relationship, which can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings. For example, cultural norms around gender roles, communication styles, and emotional expression may differ significantly.
4. Language barriers: Non-French speakers may face language barriers in their daily lives, making it difficult to communicate with their spouse, children, and other family members. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection.
5. Discrimination: Native non-French speaker men may face discrimination and prejudice from their spouse's family or community, particularly if they are from a different racial or ethnic background.
6. Financial stress: Marriage can bring additional financial responsibilities, such as sharing expenses or supporting a family. Non-French speaker men may face added financial stress if they are not familiar with the French financial system or do not speak French fluently.
7. Legal issues: Non-French speaker men may encounter legal issues related to inheritance, property ownership, or child custody. They may need to navigate the French legal system, which can be challenging for those who are not fluent in French.
8. Career impacts: Marriage can affect a man's career prospects, particularly if he is a foreigner. He may face discrimination or bias in the workplace, or he may struggle to advance in his career due to language barriers or cultural differences.
9. Identity confusion: Men who marry non-French speakers may experience confusion about their identity and sense of belonging. They may feel caught between two cultures or feel like they do not fully belong in either culture.
