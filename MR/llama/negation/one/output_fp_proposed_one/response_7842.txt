The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-disabled individuals after a spouse's death can be significant, particularly if the deceased spouse was a citizen or permanent resident of the host country. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Loss of legal rights and privileges: Non-disabled individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of the host country may face difficulties in accessing certain legal rights and privileges, such as inheritance, social security benefits, or access to healthcare.
2. Financial strain: The loss of a spouse can lead to significant financial strain, particularly if the deceased spouse was the primary breadwinner. Non-disabled individuals may struggle to maintain their financial stability, especially if they do not have access to social security benefits or other forms of support.
3. Emotional and psychological distress: The loss of a spouse can lead to significant emotional and psychological distress, including grief, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Non-disabled individuals may face additional challenges in coping with these feelings due to their immigration status.
4. Social isolation: Non-disabled individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of the host country may experience social isolation, particularly if they do not have access to support networks or social services. This can exacerbate emotional and psychological distress.
5. Difficulty accessing healthcare: Non-disabled individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of the host country may face difficulties accessing healthcare services, including medical care and mental health services. This can be particularly challenging in times of crisis or emergency.
6. Lack of access to social security benefits: Non-disabled individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of the host country may not be eligible for social security benefits, such as survivor benefits or disability benefits.
7. Limited job opportunities: Non-disabled individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of the host country may face limited job opportunities, particularly in certain industries or fields. This can make it difficult to maintain financial stability and achieve long-term economic security.
8. Discrimination and stigma: Non-disabled individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of the host country may experience discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status
