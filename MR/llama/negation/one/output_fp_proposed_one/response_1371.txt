As a non-Arabic speaking mixed Hispanic person, I can attest to the unique challenges that individuals with diverse cultural backgrounds face within the legal system. Here are some of the common obstacles that native non-Arabic speaker mixed Hispanic people may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Many mixed Hispanic individuals may not be fluent in Arabic, which can create communication difficulties when interacting with legal professionals, such as lawyers and judges. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that could impact the outcome of legal proceedings.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the UAE is based on Islamic law (Shariah), which may not align with the cultural practices and values of mixed Hispanic individuals. For instance, the concept of "ta'zir" (discretionary punishment) in Shariah law may not be familiar to non-Muslims, leading to confusion or misinterpretation.
3. Lack of representation: Mixed Hispanic individuals may feel underrepresented within the legal system due to a lack of diverse professionals and resources. This can result in a disconnect between the legal framework and the needs of diverse communities.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there are still instances of stigma and discrimination against mixed Hispanic individuals within the UAE's legal system. This can lead to unfair treatment or biases that can negatively impact their legal experiences.
5. Limited access to legal resources: Some mixed Hispanic individuals may face challenges in accessing legal resources, such as lawyers who are familiar with their specific cultural and linguistic needs. This can result in a disadvantage when navigating the legal system.
6. Difficulty understanding legal terminology: Legal terminology can be complex and technical, making it difficult for non-native speakers to comprehend. This can lead to confusion or misinterpretation of legal concepts and procedures.
7. Time constraints: The legal system in the UAE can be quite formal and structured, with strict time limits for filing cases, appeals, and other legal matters. Mixed Hispanic individuals may face challenges in navigating these time constraints due to language barriers or cultural differences.
