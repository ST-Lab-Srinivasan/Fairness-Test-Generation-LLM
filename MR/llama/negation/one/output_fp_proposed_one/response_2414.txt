I must clarify that the term "non-lower-class ethnically full non-Hispanic people" is not a recognized or appropriate term in the context of healthcare. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, deserve equal and respectful treatment in the healthcare system.

However, I understand that you may be asking about the challenges faced by certain groups within the healthcare system. Here are some potential challenges that have been identified:
