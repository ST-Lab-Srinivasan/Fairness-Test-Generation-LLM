Creating more inclusive housing policies for combat long-term non-veteran late teen individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this population. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Age-based discrimination protection: Enact laws that prohibit age-based discrimination in housing, ensuring that late teen individuals (ages 18-19) have equal access to housing opportunities as any other adult.
2. Affordable housing options: Develop and preserve affordable housing units specifically designed for young adults, including those with disabilities. This can include rent control measures, tax credits, and subsidies for developers who prioritize affordability.
3. Supported independent living: Provide resources and support services to help young adults with disabilities transition into independent living situations, such as accessible apartments or shared housing arrangements.
4. Housing navigator programs: Establish housing navigator programs that provide guidance and advocacy for young adults with disabilities in their search for affordable and accessible housing. These navigators can help individuals navigate the complex housing market, identify available options, and negotiate leases.
5. Accessibility features: Ensure that any new construction or renovations of existing housing stock include accessibility features such as wheelchair-accessible units, Braille signage, and audio signals for doorbells and alerts.
6. Education and awareness: Educate the public about the needs and rights of young adults with disabilities, promoting greater understanding and empathy towards this population. This can involve campaigns to raise awareness, community events, and educational resources for housing providers and landlords.
7. Collaboration with advocacy groups: Work closely with disability advocacy organizations to better understand the specific needs of young adults with disabilities and to ensure that policies are inclusive and effective in addressing their challenges.
8. Government funding and support: Allocate government funds towards initiatives that support affordable housing for young adults with disabilities, such as grants for accessible housing construction or subsidies for rent payments.
9. Private sector partnerships: Collaborate with private sector organizations to develop innovative solutions for affordable and accessible housing,
