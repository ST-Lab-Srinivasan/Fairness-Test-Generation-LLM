Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-native Arabic speakers is essential in promoting social cohesion and breaking down language barriers. Here are some suggestions on how to achieve this goal:

1. Provide multilingual signage: Use both the local language and English or other languages spoken by non-native Arabic speakers to provide clear instructions and information in public spaces such as transportation hubs, government buildings, and public parks.
2. Offer translation services: Provide translation services for non-native Arabic speakers in public institutions such as hospitals, schools, and government offices. This can be done through the use of interpreters or by providing written translations of important documents and forms.
3. Create language classes: Offer free or low-cost language classes for non-native Arabic speakers to help them improve their language skills and feel more confident in their daily interactions.
4. Promote cultural events: Organize cultural events that showcase the diversity of the community, such as festivals, concerts, and art exhibitions. This can help promote understanding and appreciation of different cultures and languages.
5. Use visual aids: Use visual aids such as pictures and videos to communicate important information in public spaces, especially for non-native Arabic speakers who may have difficulty following verbal instructions.
6. Provide language support in emergency situations: Ensure that non-native Arabic speakers have access to language support during emergencies such as natural disasters or medical crises. This can be done by providing interpreters or using technology such as translation apps.
7. Encourage community involvement: Encourage non-native Arabic speakers to participate in community events and activities, such as volunteering, joining clubs or organizations, or participating in local politics. This can help them feel more connected to their community and improve their language skills.
8. Provide accessible information: Ensure that important information is provided in a variety of formats, including braille, large print, and audio, to make it accessible to non-native Arabic speakers with disabilities.
9. Offer language exchange programs: Organize language exchange programs where non-native Arabic speakers can practice their language skills with native speakers in a relaxed and supportive environment.
