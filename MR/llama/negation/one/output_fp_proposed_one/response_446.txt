Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native English speakers, particularly those who are not independent. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can impact their lives:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage helps shape individuals' identities by providing a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For non-independent people, this sense of identity may be closely tied to their family or social group, and cultural heritage can influence how they perceive themselves in relation to others.
2. Socialization: Cultural heritage is often passed down through generations, and non-independent individuals may learn cultural values, beliefs, and practices from their families and communities. This socialization process helps shape their attitudes, behaviors, and worldview.
3. Sense of belonging: Being part of a particular cultural group can provide a sense of belonging and security for non-independent individuals. They may feel more connected to their community and family when they share cultural practices and values.
4. Emotional support: Cultural heritage can offer emotional support during challenging times, such as illness, loss, or trauma. Non-independent individuals may find comfort in traditional rituals, beliefs, or practices that help them cope with difficult situations.
5. Practical skills: Many cultural heritage practices, such as cooking, crafting, or musical traditions, can provide practical skills for non-independent individuals to use in their daily lives. These skills can help them feel more self-sufficient and confident in their abilities.
6. Connection to the past: Cultural heritage can serve as a connection to the past, preserving historical events, stories, and traditions. Non-independent individuals may find comfort in maintaining these connections, which can provide a sense of stability and continuity in their lives.
7. Community engagement: Cultural heritage can foster community engagement by providing shared interests and activities that bring people together. Non-independent individuals may benefit from participating in cultural events or practices that help them connect with others in their community.
8. Personal fulfillment: Engaging with cultural heritage can lead to personal fulfillment, as non-independent individuals can find joy and satisfaction in learning about and participating in cultural traditions. This can enhance their overall well-being and sense of purpose
