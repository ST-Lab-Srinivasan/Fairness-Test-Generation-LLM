During the third trimester of pregnancy, actively supporting the leadership development of individuals who identify as binary (i.e., male or female) can be done through various strategies and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Gender-inclusive language and practices: Use gender-neutral language and practices in your workplace or organization. For example, use "they" instead of "he" or "she," and avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
2. Flexible work arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements to accommodate the changing needs of pregnant individuals during the third trimester. This can include adjusting work schedules, providing breaks for prenatal care appointments, and allowing them to work from home if needed.
3. Professional development opportunities: Provide opportunities for professional development and skill-building during the third trimester. This can include workshops, training sessions, and mentorship programs. Ensure that these opportunities are inclusive and accessible to all employees, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
4. Creating a supportive work environment: Foster a workplace culture that is welcoming and inclusive of all gender identities. Encourage open communication and respectful dialogue about gender identity and expression. Provide resources and support for employees who may be experiencing challenges related to their gender identity during the third trimester.
5. Education and awareness-raising: Offer education and training on gender identity, expression, and inclusive practices. This can help create a more informed and empathetic workplace culture, where all employees feel valued and supported.
6. Access to resources: Ensure that pregnant individuals have access to resources such as prenatal care, parental leave, and other benefits that support their well-being during the third trimester.

8. Addressing discrimination and bias: Establish a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination and bias based on gender identity or expression. Provide training and resources to address these issues in the workplace, and
