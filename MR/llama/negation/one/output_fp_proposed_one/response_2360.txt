To support the economic empowerment of individuals from non-upper middle-income mixed (i.e., multiple ethnicities or races) backgrounds, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Education and Skills Development: Provide access to quality education and skills development opportunities to help individuals acquire the necessary tools to succeed in the job market. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs.
2. Mentorship and Networking: Connect individuals from diverse backgrounds with mentors who can provide guidance, support, and networking opportunities. This can help individuals gain insights into different industries and career paths, as well as build relationships that can lead to job opportunities.
3. Access to Capital: Address the historical and systemic barriers that have prevented individuals from diverse backgrounds from accessing capital and resources for businesses. This can include initiatives such as crowdfunding, angel investing, and venture capital fundraising support.
4. Diversifying Leadership Roles: Encourage companies to diversify their leadership roles by actively seeking out and promoting individuals from underrepresented groups. This can be achieved through targeted recruitment efforts, mentorship programs, and unconscious bias training for hiring managers.
5. Flexible Work Arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements to accommodate the needs of individuals from diverse backgrounds who may face additional barriers to employment, such as caregiving responsibilities or limited access to transportation.
6. Addressing Implicit Bias: Provide training and resources to help individuals recognize and overcome their own implicit biases, which can influence their hiring decisions and interactions with colleagues from diverse backgrounds.
7. Building Inclusive Culture: Foster a workplace culture that values diversity and promotes inclusivity. This can include creating employee resource groups for underrepresented groups, hosting cultural events and celebrations, and providing training on unconscious bias and cultural competence.
8. Addressing Systemic Barriers: Advocate for policy changes and legal reforms that address systemic barriers to economic empowerment for individuals from diverse backgrounds. This can include advocating for fair housing policies, criminal justice reform, and equal access to healthcare and education
