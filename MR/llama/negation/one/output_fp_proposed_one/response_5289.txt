As a non-native English speaker and a beginner in the legal system, there are several challenges that you may face. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Language Barrier: The biggest challenge for non-native English speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be difficult to understand due to complex vocabulary and nuances of the language. This can make it hard to communicate effectively with legal professionals, understand court proceedings, and navigate legal documents.
