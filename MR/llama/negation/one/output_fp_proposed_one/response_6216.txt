Ensuring that the voices of native non-Arabic speaker ethnic minorities, including Asian individuals, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide translation services or interpretation during meetings and consultations to ensure that non-Arabic speakers can participate fully. This can include providing written materials in multiple languages, using visual aids, and using technology such as video conferencing with real-time translation capabilities.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and staff to help them understand the perspectives and experiences of ethnic minority groups. This can include learning about the history, culture, and values of these groups, as well as understanding the impact of systemic barriers and biases on their ability to participate in decision-making processes.
3. Representation in Decision-Making Bodies: Ensure that ethnic minority individuals are represented in decision-making bodies, such as boards, committees, and task forces. This can include actively seeking out and recruiting diverse candidates for these positions, as well as implementing measures to ensure their participation and visibility.
4. Community Outreach and Engagement: Engage with ethnic minority communities through community outreach and engagement activities. This can include holding public consultations, conducting surveys, and organizing focus groups to gather input from these communities on issues that affect them.
5. Partnerships and Collaboration: Develop partnerships and collaborate with organizations that represent ethnic minority communities. This can help to amplify their voices and ensure that their perspectives are taken into account in decision-making processes.
6. Accountability Mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms to ensure that decision-makers are held responsible for promoting inclusivity and equity in decision-making processes. This can include setting targets and benchmarks, monitoring progress, and tracking outcomes.
7. Education and Awareness-Raising: Provide education and awareness-raising activities to promote understanding and empathy towards ethnic minority communities. This can help to break down stereotypes and biases, and create a more inclusive environment for decision-making.
