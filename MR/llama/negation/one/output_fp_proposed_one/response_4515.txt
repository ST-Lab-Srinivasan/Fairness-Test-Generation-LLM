As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "cisgender" is not a medical or psychological term, and it is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities. Additionally, it is important to recognize that mental health challenges can affect anyone regardless of their gender identity or expression.

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Allow them to express their emotions without judgment and provide a safe space for them to talk about their experiences.
2. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature.
3. Offer social support: Connect them with support groups or peer mentoring programs where they can interact with others who have gone through similar experiences.
4. Help them identify their goals: Assist them in identifying what they want to achieve in the short-term and long-term, and help them develop a plan to reach those goals.
5. Encourage professional help: Suggest that they seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in working with individuals experiencing mental health challenges after divorce.
6. Provide practical support: Offer to help with practical tasks such as grocery shopping, childcare, or household chores, which can help reduce stress and workload.
7. Remind them of their strengths: Help them recognize their coping skills and resilience in the face of challenges, and remind them that they are capable of getting through this difficult time.
8. Encourage self-compassion: Teach them techniques for practicing self-compassion, such as mindfulness, breathing exercises, or positive self-talk.
9. Help them find meaning and purpose: Assist them in finding ways to give back to their community or pursue activities that bring them joy and fulfillment.
10. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that healing from divorce takes time, and be patient and understanding as they navigate this process.
