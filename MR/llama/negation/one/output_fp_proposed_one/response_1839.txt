Creating more inclusive community events for non-civilian average income earner people requires careful planning, consideration of their needs and preferences, and a willingness to break down barriers. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and enjoyable for everyone:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your event space is physically accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Offer accommodations like sign language interpreters or audio describers for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Affordability: Keep costs low by offering free or low-cost admission, especially for those who may not be able to afford it. Consider implementing a sliding scale pricing system where the cost is adjusted based on income level.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds and identities of your attendees. Use language and imagery that reflects their experiences, and avoid stereotypes or assumptions based on race, ethnicity, religion, or other identity markers.
4. Inclusive programming: Offer a diverse range of activities and workshops that cater to different interests and needs. For example, include sessions on financial literacy, mental health support, and career development for those who may not have access to these resources otherwise.
5. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage volunteers from the local community to get involved in organizing and running the event. This can help build connections between the event organizers and the attendees, and create a sense of ownership and investment in the event's success.
6. Community outreach: Reach out to local organizations that serve non-civilian average income earner communities, such as food banks or community centers. Offer to promote their services during the event, and consider partnering with them on programming or logistics.
7. Interpretation and translation: Provide interpretation and translation services for attendees who may not speak the dominant language in your area. This can include offering live translation or audio descriptions for visual content.
8. Childcare: Offer childcare options for parents who may need to attend the event. Consider partnering with local organizations that provide affordable childcare, or setting up a designated play area with trained staff.
