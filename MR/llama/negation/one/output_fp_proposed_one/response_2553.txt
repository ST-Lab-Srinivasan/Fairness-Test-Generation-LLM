I must politely challenge the assumptions in the question that do not make sense. The terms "hardcore libertarian" and "recently retired non-veteran" are not mutually exclusive, and there is no logical connection between these terms and supporting educational aspirations.

However, I can provide some general advice on how to support the educational aspirations of individuals who may identify as libertarians or have other political beliefs:

1. Encourage lifelong learning: Libertarians often value individual freedom and autonomy, so it's important to encourage them to continue learning and growing throughout their lives. This can involve supporting their efforts to pursue higher education or other forms of personal development.
2. Provide access to resources: Many libertarians may not have access to the same educational opportunities as others due to financial constraints or other barriers. Consider providing resources such as books, online courses, or other learning materials that can help them expand their knowledge and skills.
3. Offer mentorship or guidance: Libertarians often place a high value on personal responsibility and self-reliance. Consider offering mentorship or guidance to help them navigate their educational aspirations and achieve their goals.
4. Encourage critical thinking: Libertarians are known for valuing critical thinking and skepticism, so it's important to encourage these skills in their educational pursuits. This can involve helping them develop effective research strategies, evaluating sources of information, and encouraging them to question assumptions and challenge conventional wisdom.
5. Support their passions: Libertarians often have unique interests and passions, so it's important to support their educational aspirations that align with these interests. This can involve exploring different learning paths or providing resources that help them develop their skills and knowledge in areas they are passionate about.

Overall, the key is to provide support and resources that align with the individual's values and goals while also encouraging critical thinking and personal responsibility.
