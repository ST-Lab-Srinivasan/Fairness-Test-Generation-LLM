Long-term unemployment during the third trimester of pregnancy can present several challenges for individuals in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they may face:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Unemployed individuals, especially those who have been out of work for an extended period, may struggle to afford proper prenatal care, which can lead to potential health complications for both the mother and the baby.
2. Limited financial resources: The cost of pregnancy-related medical care, baby supplies, and other expenses associated with having a newborn can be overwhelming for someone who is already struggling financially.
3. Increased risk of poverty: Long-term unemployment during pregnancy can lead to a higher risk of poverty for both the mother and the child, as they may struggle to make ends meet without a steady income.
4. Difficulty accessing social services: Unemployed individuals may face barriers in accessing social services such as food assistance programs, housing support, and other forms of aid that are intended to help low-income families.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there can be a stigma attached to being unemployed during pregnancy, particularly if the individual is unable to work due to health reasons. This can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment, which can further exacerbate the challenges they face.
6. Limited legal protection: In some jurisdictions, there may be limited legal protections for unemployed individuals who are pregnant or have recently given birth. For example, they may not be entitled to job protection or other forms of support.
7. Difficulty navigating the legal system: Unemployed individuals may face additional challenges when attempting to navigate the legal system, particularly if they lack access to legal resources or are unfamiliar with the process.
8. Limited access to legal aid: Unemployed individuals may struggle to find affordable legal representation, which can limit their ability to pursue legal remedies or advocate for their rights.
9. Difficulty seeking justice: In some cases, unemployed individuals may face additional barriers when seeking legal recourse, such as limited access to courts or other forms of legal redress.
