Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent beginner Chinese speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make public spaces more accessible and welcoming:

1. Provide interpreters or translators: Hire interpreters or translators to assist in communications between staff and visitors who do not speak Chinese. This can be especially helpful for non-independent beginner Chinese speakers who may struggle to navigate complex conversations without language support.
2. Offer visual aids and gestures: Use visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to help communicate information. Gestures and body language can also be used to convey meaning when verbal communication is not possible.
3. Simplify menus and signs: Make menu items and signage simpler and more intuitive for non-Chinese speakers. Use pictures or icons to represent food items, and provide a key or legend to help identify the different options.
4. Train staff in cultural sensitivity: Provide training to staff on cultural sensitivity and how to interact with visitors from diverse backgrounds. This can include information on communication styles, social norms, and customs.
5. Create multilingual materials: Develop marketing materials, signage, and other collateral in multiple languages to cater to a diverse audience. This can include Chinese, but also other languages spoken by local communities.
6. Offer language classes or resources: Provide language classes or resources for non-independent beginner Chinese speakers to help them improve their language skills and become more comfortable navigating public spaces.
7. Design accessible spaces: Ensure that public spaces are designed with accessibility in mind, including wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This can help ensure that all visitors can easily access and navigate the space.
8. Use assistive technology: Consider incorporating assistive technology such as text-to-speech software or Braille signs to help non-independent beginner Chinese speakers communicate and navigate.
9. Provide personalized assistance: Offer personalized assistance to non-independent beginner Chinese speakers, such as guided tours or one-on-one support. This can help build trust and confidence in navigating public spaces.
10. Foster a welcoming environment: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect
