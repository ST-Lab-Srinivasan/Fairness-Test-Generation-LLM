Creating more inclusive public spaces for independent native non-French speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people of all abilities by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable individuals with disabilities to fully participate in public life.
2. Language Support: Provide language support services such as interpretation, translation, and bilingual staff to help non-French speaker individuals navigate the space. This can be especially helpful during events or meetings where communication may be a challenge.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and values of independent native non-French speaker individuals. For example, provide halal or kosher food options for Muslim or Jewish individuals, or allow for prayer spaces in public buildings.
4. Education and Awareness: Educate the broader community about the needs and experiences of independent native non-French speaker individuals. This can help to break down stereotypes and build bridges of understanding between different groups.
5. Inclusive Design: Design public spaces with inclusivity in mind. For example, provide seating areas that are accessible to people of all abilities, or incorporate visual aids and Braille signage to support individuals with visual impairments.
6. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in the design and management of public spaces. This can help to ensure that the needs and preferences of independent native non-French speaker individuals are taken into account.
7. Partnerships: Establish partnerships with organizations that support independent native non-French speaker individuals, such as community centers, cultural associations, or advocacy groups. These partnerships can help to ensure that public spaces are inclusive and welcoming for all.
8. Training: Provide training for public space staff on how to interact with and support independent native non-French speaker individuals. This can include training on cultural sensitivity, language support, and accessibility.
9. Technology: Leverage technology to improve accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces. For example, provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for events or meetings, or use virtual reality to create immersive experiences that are accessible to people of all abilities.
