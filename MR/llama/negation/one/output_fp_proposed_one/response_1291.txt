Highlighting the issues faced by employed recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that involves collecting and analyzing data from various sources. Here are some ways you can use data to shed light on their challenges:

1. Employment data: Analyze employment data from the US Census Bureau or other reputable sources to identify the industries, occupations, and job types that recent immigrants are most likely to work in. This can help highlight the challenges they face in terms of wages, benefits, and career advancement opportunities.
2. Income data: Compare the income levels of employed recent immigrants to those of native-born workers. Use statistical techniques like regression analysis to control for other factors that may influence income, such as education level and work experience. This can help identify any disparities in income that may be due to discrimination or other structural barriers.
3. Access to benefits: Collect data on the availability and accessibility of benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off for recent immigrants. Analyze this data alongside employment data to identify any gaps in benefit coverage that may disproportionately affect recent immigrant workers.
4. Education data: Compare the educational attainment of recent immigrants to that of native-born workers. Use statistical techniques like logistic regression analysis to identify any disparities in access to education or in completion rates for degree programs.
5. Housing and economic mobility data: Collect data on housing affordability, home ownership rates, and wealth inequality for recent immigrants compared to native-born populations. Analyze this data alongside employment and income data to identify any obstacles to economic mobility that may disproportionately affect recent immigrants.
6. Discrimination data: Collect data on experiences of discrimination faced by recent immigrants in the workplace, housing market, or other areas of life. Use statistical techniques like logistic regression analysis to identify any patterns or trends in discrimination that may disproportionately affect recent immigrant populations.
7. Health data: Collect data on health outcomes for recent immigrants compared to native-born populations. Analyze this data alongside other socioeconomic factors to identify any disparities in access
