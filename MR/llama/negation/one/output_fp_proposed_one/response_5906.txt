Physically disabled long-time non-married people may face a range of challenges when accessing healthcare services. Some of the common challenges include:

1. Lack of accessibility: Many healthcare facilities are not designed to accommodate people with physical disabilities, making it difficult for them to access care. For example, buildings may not have wheelchair ramps or elevators, or examination rooms may not be large enough to accommodate a wheelchair.
2. Limited transportation options: People with physical disabilities may rely on public transportation to get to appointments, but public transportation can be unreliable or inaccessible, particularly in areas with limited service.
3. Discrimination and stigma: People with physical disabilities may experience discrimination or stigma when interacting with healthcare providers, which can affect their ability to receive appropriate care.
4. Lack of understanding: Healthcare providers may not fully understand the needs and experiences of people with physical disabilities, leading to inadequate care or misdiagnosis.
5. Limited communication options: People with physical disabilities may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers due to language barriers or difficulty expressing themselves verbally or nonverbally.
6. Difficulty navigating the system: Non-married people may face additional challenges in navigating the healthcare system, such as lack of support from family members or limited access to health insurance.
7. Limited access to rehabilitation services: People with physical disabilities may have difficulty accessing rehabilitation services, such as physical therapy or occupational therapy, which can hinder their recovery and independence.
