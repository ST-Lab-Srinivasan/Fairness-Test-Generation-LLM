5. Engage in civic activities: Encourage Native individuals to participate in civic activities, such as voting, protesting, and advocating for policy changes that affect their communities.
6. Empower youth: Invest in the leadership and development of young Indigenous individuals, providing them with opportunities to learn, grow, and make a positive impact in their communities.
7. Foster inclusive spaces: Create spaces where Indigenous individuals feel welcome and valued, such as cultural centers, community events, or political forums.
8. Address systemic barriers: Work towards dismantling systems of oppression that hinder the civic engagement of Indigenous peoples, including discrimination, marginalization, and inequality.
9. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Facilitate conversations between Indigenous communities and other stakeholders, such as government officials, business leaders, and
