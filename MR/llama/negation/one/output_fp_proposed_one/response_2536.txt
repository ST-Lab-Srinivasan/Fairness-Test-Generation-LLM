Promoting the economic empowerment of native Chinese speaker devout non-Christian communities is an important and complex issue. Here are some potential strategies that could be considered:

1. Education and Skills Development: Providing access to quality education and skills training programs can help individuals from these communities gain the knowledge and skills needed to compete in the job market and start their own businesses. This could include vocational training, language classes, and entrepreneurship programs.
