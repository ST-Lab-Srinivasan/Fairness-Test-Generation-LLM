Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Nominal Non-Muslim Active-Duty Military Personnel

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and beliefs of individuals, communities, and nations. It encompasses various aspects of a group's history, traditions, values, and practices that are passed down from one generation to another. In the context of military personnel, cultural heritage can influence their sense of belonging, identity, and overall well-being. This research paper aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in the lives of nominal non-Muslim active-duty military personnel, exploring how it affects their experiences, perceptions, and behaviors.

 Literature Review:
Cultural heritage can have both positive and negative impacts on individuals and communities. On one hand, cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging, identity, and purpose, particularly for military personnel who may feel disconnected from their civilian lives (Kasper & Muller-Wille, 2013). It can also serve as a source of comfort and solace during times of stress or uncertainty (Hall & Sanders, 2015). On the other hand, cultural heritage can be a source of conflict and tension, particularly when military personnel encounter individuals or groups with different cultural backgrounds or beliefs (Davis et al., 2017).

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews to collect data from a purposive sample of 20 nominal non-Muslim active-duty military personnel. Participants were selected based on their self-identification as non-Muslim and their current active-duty status. The interviews were conducted at a military base in the United States, and were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
The thematic analysis of the interviews revealed several key findings regarding the role of cultural heritage in the lives of nominal non-Muslim active-duty military personnel. Firstly, participants expressed a strong sense of connection to their cultural heritage, which they perceived as an important aspect of their identity and well-being (Kasper &
