Creating more inclusive community events for beginner non-French speaker poor people requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Offer translation services or provide written materials in the local language to help participants understand the event's content. This can include interpreters, translators, or printed materials such as flyers, posters, or program guides.
2. Accessibility measures: Make sure that the event location is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair access, Braille signage, and audio descriptions. Provide seating options for participants who may need them, such as extra chairs or cushions.
3. Affordable food and drinks: Offer affordable food and drink options that are culturally appropriate and accessible to people with different dietary needs. Consider serving vegetarian or vegan options, and provide water and other non-alcoholic beverages.
4. Inclusive programming: Plan events that cater to the diverse interests and needs of participants. This can include cultural performances, workshops, and activities that promote social interaction and community building.
5. Outreach and marketing: Use multiple channels to reach out to potential participants, including social media, flyers, posters, and word of mouth. Ensure that the event is well-advertised and accessible to people who may not have access to the internet or social media.
6. Volunteer support: Recruit volunteers from the community to help with event planning, setup, and execution. This can include translation services, cultural liaisons, and other forms of support.
7. Community engagement: Involve the local community in event planning and execution by holding town hall meetings or community forums. Encourage feedback and suggestions from participants to ensure that the event is inclusive and meets their needs.
8. Collaboration with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve low-income communities, such as food banks or community centers, to help promote the event and provide support.
9. Flexible scheduling: Offer events at times that are convenient for participants who may have difficulty attending during traditional working hours. Consider hosting events on weekends or in the evenings to make them more accessible.
