I cannot provide answers that promote or perpetuate harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discrimination, xenophobia, and racism have no place in a just and equitable society.

Instead, I would like to focus on promoting inclusivity, empathy, and respect for the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities.
