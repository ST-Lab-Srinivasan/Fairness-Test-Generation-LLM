For example, cultural festivals can include food, music, and dance performances that represent diverse cultures, and language classes can be offered for adults and children.

5. Outreach and Promotion: Use multiple channels to reach out to non-English speaker and immigrant communities, such as social media, community events, and word of mouth. Provide clear information about the programs and services offered, and promote them through languages that are familiar to these communities.
6. Flexible Scheduling: Offer programs and services at times that are convenient for non-English speaker and immigrant communities, taking into account their work schedules, family obligations, and other commitments.
