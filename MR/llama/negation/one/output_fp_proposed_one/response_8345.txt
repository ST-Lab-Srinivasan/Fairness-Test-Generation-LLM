As a beginning non-French speaker and an extreme soft libertarian, the military status can have various impacts on your life. Here are some potential effects to consider:

1. Conscription: In some countries, there is a conscription system where citizens are required to serve in the military for a certain period of time. As a non-French speaker, you may be exempt from conscription, but this can vary depending on the country and its laws.
2. Access to education and training: Depending on the country's military system, you may have access to educational and training programs that can help you develop skills in areas such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving. These skills can be valuable in both a military and civilian context.
3. Networking opportunities: Joining the military can provide opportunities to network with other individuals who share similar values and beliefs. This can lead to lasting friendships and professional connections that can benefit you throughout your life.
4. Travel opportunities: The military often provides opportunities for travel, both within the country and internationally. As a non-French speaker, you may have the chance to explore new cultures and languages, which can broaden your horizons and enhance your understanding of the world.
5. Personal growth: Serving in the military can be a transformative experience that challenges individuals to push themselves beyond their limits. As an extreme soft libertarian, you may find that the structure and discipline of the military provide a unique opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery.
6. Career opportunities: After serving in the military, you may have access to career opportunities in fields such as law enforcement, security, or emergency response. These careers can be rewarding and provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment.
7. Stigma and social isolation: Unfortunately, there may be a stigma associated with serving in the military, particularly for individuals who hold extreme political views like soft libertarianism. This could lead to social isolation or discrimination, which can have negative impacts on your mental health and well-being.
8. Legal restrictions: Depending on the country's laws and regulations, you may face legal restrictions on your activities as a member of the military. These restrictions could limit your freedom of speech, assembly, or association,
