As a beginner non-French speaker recent immigrant to Canada, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in Canada. Here are some of the common difficulties you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: If you don't speak French or English fluently, it can be difficult to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who may only speak one of these languages. You may need to rely on an interpreter or translator to help you understand the legal process and communicate your needs.
2. Lack of knowledge about Canadian laws and regulations: As a new immigrant, you may be unfamiliar with Canadian laws and regulations, which can make it challenging to navigate the legal system. You may need to research and learn about these laws and regulations to make informed decisions about your legal issues.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on where you live in Canada, you may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal clinics, and other organizations that provide free or low-cost legal services. This can make it difficult to get the legal help you need, especially if you are experiencing financial difficulties.
4. Cultural differences: The legal system in Canada is based on common law, which may be different from the legal systems in your home country. Additionally, there may be cultural differences that affect how you interact with the legal system, such as differences in communication styles or expectations around confidentiality.
5. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias can still exist in the legal system in Canada, particularly against marginalized communities. As a recent immigrant, you may face additional barriers due to your race, ethnicity, religion, or other aspects of your identity.
6. Lack of trust in the legal system: As a beginner non-French speaker recent immigrant, you may feel uncomfortable or distrustful of the legal system in Canada due to cultural or historical factors. This can make it difficult to seek help from legal professionals or to navigate the legal process effectively.
7. Limited access to legal aid: Depending on your income level and the province where you live, you may have limited access to legal aid services. This can make it difficult to get the legal help you need, especially if you are experiencing financial difficulties.
