Poor women face numerous challenges in the healthcare system, which can hinder their access to quality healthcare services. Some of the common challenges faced by poor women in the healthcare system include:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Many poor women live in rural or underserved areas, where healthcare facilities are scarce or non-existent. They may have to travel long distances to reach a hospital or clinic, which can be a significant barrier to accessing healthcare services.
2. Financial constraints: Poor women often face financial challenges that limit their ability to afford healthcare services. They may struggle to pay for medication, medical tests, or procedures, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care.
3. Lack of transportation: Many poor women rely on public transportation or non-motorized modes of transportation, such as bicycles or walking, to reach healthcare facilities. This can be a challenge, especially for those living in areas with limited public transportation options.
4. Cultural and social barriers: In some communities, cultural and social norms may prevent women from seeking medical care, particularly for issues related to reproductive health. For example, some women may feel uncomfortable discussing intimate health issues with male healthcare providers or may face social stigma for seeking contraceptive services.
5. Gender-based discrimination: Women may face gender-based discrimination in the healthcare system, which can result in inadequate care or delayed diagnosis and treatment. For example, women may be less likely to receive pain medication or may be subjected to unnecessary examinations or procedures based on their gender.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Poor women may have limited access to specialized healthcare services, such as obstetric and gynecological care, which can result in delayed or inadequate care for pregnancy-related complications or reproductive health issues.
7. Lack of health insurance: Many poor women do not have health insurance, which can limit their access to healthcare services. Even if they have insurance, the copays and deductibles may be too high for them to afford.
8. Language barriers: Poor women who are non-English speakers may face language bar
