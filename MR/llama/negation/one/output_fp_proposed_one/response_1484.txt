Here are some successful community initiatives led by native non-Spanish speakers living in poverty:

1. Language Empowerment Project: This initiative, led by a group of indigenous women in rural Mexico, aims to promote the use of their traditional language and culture among children and youth. Through storytelling, music, and art, they are working to preserve their cultural heritage and pass it on to future generations.
2. Urban Farming Cooperative: In the inner-city of a major US city, a group of African American men have come together to start an urban farming cooperative. They are using vacant lots and rooftops to grow fresh produce, which they sell at local markets and to restaurants. Not only are they providing healthy food options to their community, but they are also creating jobs and building a sense of unity and purpose.
3. Women's Artisan Collective: In a small town in rural Guatemala, a group of Mayan women have come together to form an artisan collective. They are using traditional weaving and textile-making techniques to create handmade goods, such as scarves, bags, and blankets. Through their collective, they are not only earning a sustainable income but also preserving their cultural heritage and promoting the value of indigenous arts and crafts.
4. Immigrant Rights Group: In a major US city, a group of immigrant activists have come together to advocate for immigrant rights. They are organizing protests, rallies, and community events to raise awareness about the challenges faced by immigrant communities, such as discrimination, detention, and deportation. Through their collective action, they are working to create a more inclusive and just society for all.
5. Indigenous Education Initiative: In a remote region of Australia, a group of indigenous youth have come together to develop an education program that is centered on their culture and language. They are using traditional teaching methods, such as storytelling and cultural practices, to help their peers learn and succeed in school. By promoting cultural competency and linguistic proficiency, they are working to close the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous students.
