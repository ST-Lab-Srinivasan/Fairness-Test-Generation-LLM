5. Lack of representation and voice: Women with disabilities may have limited representation in decision-making roles, leading to a lack of voice and agency in shaping policies and practices that affect their lives.
6. Healthcare disparities: Women with disabilities may experience disparities in healthcare access and quality, including inadequate pain management, limited reproductive healthcare options, and inaccessible medical facilities.
7. Economic inequality: Women with disabilities may face economic inequality due to limited job opportunities and lower wages, leading to financial insecurity and dependence on family or government support.
8. Limited access to technology and assistive devices: Women with disabilities may have limited access to assistive devices and technologies that can help them participate fully in society, such as wheelchairs, prosthetics, and communication aids.
9. Lack of transportation options: Women with disabilities may face barriers in accessing transportation, including lack of accessible public transportation options or discrimination by taxi drivers.
10. Unconscious bias and microaggressions: Women with disabilities may experience unconscious bias and microaggressions from healthcare providers, employers, and others, which can lead to feelings of frustration and powerlessness.
