Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Alone After Spouse's Death among Native Non-Spanish Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Losing a spouse can be a traumatic experience, leaving the surviving partner to navigate their identity and sense of self. In many cultures, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals after the loss of a loved one. This paper explores the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of native non-Spanish speaker individuals after the death of their spouse.

Theoretical Framework:
This study is informed by the Theory of Identity, which posits that an individual's identity is composed of various aspects, including personal characteristics, beliefs, values, and experiences (Crockett & Jetten, 2017). Cultural heritage is a critical aspect of an individual's identity, as it influences their sense of belonging, values, and beliefs (Harris, 2013). The loss of a spouse can lead to a disruption in an individual's identity, as they must redefine themselves without the partner who played a significant role in their life.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with native non-Spanish speaker individuals who have lost their spouses. The participants were recruited through community centers and online forums, ensuring diversity in terms of age, gender, and cultural background. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a detailed analysis of the participants' experiences.

For instance, some participants shared stories about their cultural rituals and ceremonies that brought them comfort during the grieving process. Others talked about the importance of maintaining family customs and values, which provided a sense of continuity and stability in an otherwise chaotic time.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the significance of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of native
