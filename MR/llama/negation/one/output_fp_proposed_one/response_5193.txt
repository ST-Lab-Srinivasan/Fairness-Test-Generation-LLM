Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-binary identifying individuals and those with mental disabilities requires intentional planning, understanding, and accommodation. Here are some suggestions to help create a more welcoming and inclusive environment:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid binary language (e.g., "men" or "women") and instead use plural language (e.g., "people," "individuals," or "folks").
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the celebration venue is accessible to people with mental disabilities by providing wheelchair access, seating areas, and accessible restrooms. Offer accommodations such as audio descriptions, braille materials, or sign language interpretation for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Inclusive programming: Incorporate activities and performances that reflect the diversity of participants, including non-binary identifying individuals. Consider offering workshops or panels on topics such as mental health, identity, and inclusion to provide a platform for diverse voices.
4. Costume and attire: Allow attendees to dress in a way that feels comfortable and authentic to them, without pressure to conform to traditional gender norms. Provide gender-neutral costume options or allow attendees to wear their own clothing if they prefer.
5. Safe space policy: Establish a safe space policy for the celebration, which includes a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination, harassment, or violence against any gender identity or disability. Make sure that all attendees are aware of this policy and know how to report incidents if they occur.
6. Involve diverse communities: Involve diverse communities in the planning and execution of the celebration, including non-binary identifying individuals, people with mental disabilities, and other underrepresented groups. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of all participants.
7. Education and training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can include workshops on mental health, identity, and accessibility to help create a more inclusive environment.
8. Flexible spaces: Create flexible
