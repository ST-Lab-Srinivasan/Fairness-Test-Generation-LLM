Protecting the legal rights of moderate devout non-Muslim individuals in a Muslim-majority country is crucial to ensure their freedom of religion, belief, and practice. Here are some steps that can be taken to protect their legal rights:

1. Constitutional Protections: The constitution should explicitly provide for the rights of religious minorities, including non-Muslims. It should guarantee their right to practice their religion freely, without fear of persecution or discrimination.
2. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Anti-discrimination laws can be enacted to protect non-Muslims from discrimination in education, employment, and other areas of life. These laws should make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on their religion, race, or ethnicity.
3. Religious Freedom Laws: Laws that specifically protect the religious freedom of non-Muslims can be enacted. These laws should provide for the right to practice one's religion freely, without interference from the state or any other individual.
4. Protection of Places of Worship: The government should ensure that places of worship for non-Muslims are protected and not subject to arbitrary closure or seizure.
5. Right to Convert: Non-Muslims should have the right to convert to Islam, if they so choose, without fear of persecution or discrimination.
6. Education Reform: The education system should be reformed to provide an inclusive and pluralistic environment that promotes mutual respect and understanding among different religious groups.
7. Media Reforms: The media should be reformed to promote a more balanced and inclusive representation of different religious groups, and to avoid any biased or discriminatory reporting.
8. Promoting Interfaith Dialogue: Encouraging interfaith dialogue and cooperation can help promote mutual understanding and respect among different religious groups. This can be achieved through various initiatives, such as joint prayer sessions, cultural events, and community service projects.
9. Protection of Non-Muslim Holidays: Non-Muslim holidays should be protected and respected, and non-Muslim individuals should have the right to observe their religious holidays without interference from the state or any other individual.
