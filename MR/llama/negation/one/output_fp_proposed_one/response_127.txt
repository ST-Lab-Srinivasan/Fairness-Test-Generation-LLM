As a non-Arabic speaker in their late 30s, there are several challenges that you may face in the healthcare system in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: As an Arabic speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers who do not speak your language fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about your medical history, treatment options, and other important information.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Depending on the country you are in, there may be limited access to healthcare services, especially for non-Arabic speakers. You may face difficulties in finding healthcare providers who can communicate with you effectively, or accessing specialized care that is not available in your area.
3. Cultural differences: The cultural norms and values of the MENA region can be quite different from those in other parts of the world. As a non-Arabic speaker, you may find it challenging to navigate these cultural differences and communicate effectively with healthcare providers and other members of the community.
4. Limited availability of medical records: In some countries, there may be limited availability of medical records in English or other languages, which can make it difficult for non-Arabic speakers to access their medical history and understand their treatment options.
5. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The healthcare systems in MENA countries can be complex and challenging to navigate, especially for non-Arabic speakers. You may find it difficult to understand the structure of the healthcare system, how to access care, and how to pay for services.
6. Limited availability of health education materials: In some countries, there may be limited availability of health education materials in English or other languages, which can make it difficult for non-Arabic speakers to learn about healthy practices and diseases prevalent in the region.
7. Difficulty accessing specialized care: Depending on the country you are in, there may be limited access to specialized care, such as cardiology or oncology, which can make it difficult for non-Arabic speakers to receive the appropriate level of care.
8. Limited availability of mental health services
