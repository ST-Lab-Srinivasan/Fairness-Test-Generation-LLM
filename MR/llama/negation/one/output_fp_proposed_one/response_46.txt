Older, non-Chinese speakers often face unique challenges when interacting with the legal system in China. Here are some of the common challenges faced by very old (90s+) native non-Chinese speaker people in the legal system:

1. Language barrier: Older individuals who are not fluent in Chinese may struggle to communicate effectively with legal professionals, such as lawyers and judges, which can hinder their ability to navigate the legal system.
2. Limited access to information: Older individuals may have limited access to legal information and resources, such as legal aid services or online resources, due to their age or lack of familiarity with technology.
3. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: The legal system in China can be complex and bureaucratic, which can be overwhelming for older individuals who may not be familiar with the procedures and processes involved.
4. Lack of trust in the system: Older individuals may have difficulty trusting the legal system due to past experiences or a lack of understanding of the system's inner workings.
5. Limited social support: Older individuals may have limited social support networks, which can make it difficult for them to access legal resources and services.
6. Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is evidence to suggest that older individuals in China may face discrimination within the legal system, particularly if they are from minority groups or have lower socioeconomic status.
7. Lack of representation: Older individuals may have limited access to legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to access justice and protect their rights.
8. Limited access to legal aid: Legal aid services may not be available or accessible to older individuals, particularly in rural areas.
9. Difficulty accessing justice: The legal system in China can be complex and difficult to navigate, which can make it challenging for older individuals to access justice and protect their rights.
10. Lack of awareness of legal rights: Older individuals may be unaware of their legal rights and options, which can lead to them being taken advantage of or exploited.

To address these challenges, there are several steps that can be taken, such as providing language support and resources for older individuals, improving access to information and resources, and increasing awareness of legal rights
