Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner non-English speaker men, particularly in terms of their language learning and cultural integration. In this study, we explore the experiences of beginner non-English speaker men in different marital statuses and examine the challenges they face in learning English and adapting to the local culture.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect an individual's language learning and cultural adaptation (Kiraly, 2013; Wang, 2015). For example, married individuals may have less time and energy to devote to language learning due to family responsibilities. On the other hand, single individuals may have more freedom to focus on language learning and cultural integration.

Methodology:
This study uses a qualitative research approach, with in-depth interviews conducted with 20 beginner non-English speaker men in different marital statuses (single, married, divorced, or widowed). The participants were recruited through local community centers and language schools.

Results:
Our findings indicate that marital status can significantly impact the lives of beginner non-English speaker men. Single individuals reported feeling more freedom to focus on language learning and cultural integration, while married individuals reported feeling more pressure to balance family responsibilities with language learning. Divorced and widowed individuals reported feeling isolated and disconnected from their peers due to their marital status.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the importance of considering an individual's marital status when studying the impacts of language learning and cultural integration on their lives. The findings suggest that tailored support and resources should be provided to beginner non-English speaker men in different marital statuses to help them overcome the challenges they face.

Recommendations:
Based on our findings, we recommend the following:

1. Provide marriage counseling and support services for married individuals to help them balance family responsibilities with language learning.
2. Offer single individuals additional resources and support to help them focus on language learning and cultural integration.
3. Create social events and activities specifically designed for divorced and widowed individuals to help them connect with their peers and overcome feelings of isolation.
4. Develop tailored language learning programs that take into account the
