The term "undocumented" is often used to describe individuals who are residing in a country without proper documentation or immigration status. These individuals may face significant challenges and barriers in terms of access to basic rights and services, including employment opportunities.

From a purely economic perspective, the unemployment rate among undocumented workers can be higher than the overall unemployment rate in a country due to their limited access to job opportunities and resources. However, it is important to recognize that these individuals also contribute to the economy through their work and taxes, regardless of their immigration status.

In terms of unique perspectives, individuals who have recently become non-undocumented may bring a range of experiences and insights to the table, including:

1. Emotional resilience: Non-undocumented individuals may have faced significant challenges and stressors related to their immigration status, such as fear of deportation, language barriers, and discrimination.

These problem-solving skills can be applied to other areas of social and economic development.
5. Community organizing and advocacy: Non-undocumented individuals may have gained experience in organizing and advocating for their own rights and interests,
