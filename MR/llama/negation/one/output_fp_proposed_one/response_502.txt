3. Lack of access to healthcare: People with disabilities may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including lack of transportation, inaccessible clinics, and discrimination by healthcare providers.

5. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities may experience stigma and discrimination from society, which can lead to lower self-esteem, social isolation, and mental health problems.

7. Emotional distress: The trauma of divorce can be exacerbated for people with disabilities who may already experience emotional distress due to societal stigma, discrimination, or lack of support.
8. Lack of representation and advocacy: Divorced individuals with disabilities may have limited access to legal representation and advocacy services, which can further marginalize their experiences and needs.
