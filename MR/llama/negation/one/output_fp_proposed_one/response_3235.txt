Mexican devout non-Christians, including those who practice indigenous religions, may face a number of challenges within the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of recognition and protection of indigenous rights: Mexico has a long history of colonization and discrimination against indigenous peoples. As a result, indigenous religions and cultural practices are often not recognized or protected by the legal system.
2. Limited access to justice: Many indigenous communities in Mexico lack access to legal services and resources, making it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and defend their rights.
3. Lack of representation: Indigenous people may be underrepresented in the legal system, both as lawyers and judges. This can result in a lack of understanding and appreciation of indigenous cultural practices and beliefs within the legal system.
4. Discrimination: Indigenous people may face discrimination within the legal system, which can limit their ability to access justice and have their rights recognized.
5. Lack of language and cultural mediation: Many indigenous communities in Mexico speak indigenous languages and may not be fluent in Spanish, the official language of Mexico. This can create a barrier to accessing legal services and understanding the legal system.
6. Lack of access to traditional lands and resources: Indigenous communities may face challenges in accessing their traditional lands and resources due to conflicts with other groups or the government.
7. Limited access to education: Many indigenous communities in Mexico have limited access to education, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and defend their rights.
8. Lack of autonomy: Indigenous communities may face challenges in asserting their autonomy and self-governance within the legal system, which can limit their ability to make decisions about their own affairs.
9. Limited access to financial resources: Many indigenous communities in Mexico have limited financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to access legal services and defend their rights.
10. Lack of political power: Indigenous communities may face challenges in asserting their political power within the legal system, which can limit their ability to influence policy and decision-making processes.
