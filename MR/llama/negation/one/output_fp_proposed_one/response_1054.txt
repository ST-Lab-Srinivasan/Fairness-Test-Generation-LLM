As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "non-upper-class" is problematic as it can be perceived as perpetuating harmful social hierarchies.

Regardless of socioeconomic status, all individuals deserve equitable access to quality healthcare. However, low-income and working-class individuals often face unique challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to healthcare providers: Low-income individuals may have limited access to primary care physicians, specialists, or hospitals due to a lack of healthcare facilities in their area or limited financial resources for transportation and copays.
2. Delayed or deferred care: Due to financial constraints, low-income individuals may delay seeking medical attention until their condition worsens, leading to more severe illnesses and greater healthcare needs.
3. Limited medication access: Low-income individuals may struggle to afford prescription medications, leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes or reliance on less effective or more expensive alternatives.
4. Discrimination and stigma: Unfortunately, some healthcare providers may hold biases against low-income patients, which can lead to inadequate care, poor communication, or feelings of shame or embarrassment.
5. Language barriers: Low-income individuals who are non-native English speakers may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers due to language barriers, leading to misunderstandings or delays in diagnosis and treatment.
6. Complex social determinants of health: Low-income individuals may face a range of social determinants of health that can impact their ability to access quality healthcare, including food insecurity, housing instability, and limited transportation options.
7. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may lack understanding or cultural competency when caring for low-income patients from diverse backgrounds, leading to inadequate care or mistrust of the healthcare system.
8. Administrative barriers: Low-income individuals may face difficulties navigating complex healthcare
