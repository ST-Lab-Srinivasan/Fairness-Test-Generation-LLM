Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent native English speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable individuals with mobility impairments to fully participate in the space.
2. Language Support: Provide language support services such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual staff to help non-independent native English speaker individuals communicate effectively. This can include visual aids, written materials, and other forms of communication support.

4. Inclusive Design: Design public spaces that are inclusive of people with different abilities, ages, and backgrounds. This can include features such as accessible seating, gentle slopes for wheelchair accessibility, and visual cues for wayfinding.
