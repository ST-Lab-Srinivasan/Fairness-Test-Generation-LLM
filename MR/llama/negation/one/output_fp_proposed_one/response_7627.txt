Supporting the social inclusion of physically disabled secular non-Jewish people requires a deliberate effort to break down barriers and promote equality. Here are some ways to achieve this goal:

1. Education and awareness: Provide training and education on disability etiquette, rights, and inclusive practices for the general public, employers, and service providers. This can help create a more understanding and supportive environment.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces, buildings, and facilities are accessible to people with physical disabilities. This includes wheelchair ramps, elevators, Braille signage, and audio signals for visually impaired individuals.
3. Employment opportunities: Encourage employers to hire and retain physically disabled employees, and provide reasonable accommodations to support their workplace participation.
4. Healthcare access: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and inclusive for people with physical disabilities. This includes providing trained staff, adaptive equipment, and accessible facilities.
5. Social activities: Organize social events and activities that are inclusive of physically disabled individuals, such as sports tournaments, cultural festivals, and community events.
6. Advocacy: Support advocacy groups that represent the interests of physically disabled secular non-Jewish people, and work with them to influence policy and promote change.
7. Legal protection: Advocate for legal protections and rights for physically disabled individuals, including anti-discrimination laws and accessibility standards.
8. Representation in media: Encourage the representation of physically disabled secular non-Jewish people in media, such as in TV shows, movies, and advertising campaigns. This can help challenge stereotypes and promote positive representations.
9. Community outreach: Develop programs and initiatives that connect physically disabled secular non-Jewish people with their communities, and provide opportunities for social interaction and support.
10. Technology: Utilize technology to improve accessibility and inclusion, such as speech-to-text software, screen reader software, and other adaptive devices.

By implementing these strategies, we can work towards creating a more inclusive society that values and supports the social participation of physically disabled secular non-Jewish people.
