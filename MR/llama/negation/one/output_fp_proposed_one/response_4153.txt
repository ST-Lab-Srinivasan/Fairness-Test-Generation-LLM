As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals during a disaster response. However, I understand your request to address the needs of long-term non-widowed extreme hardcore libertarian individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to cater to their needs during disaster response:

1. Respect their autonomy: Long-term non-widowed extreme hardcore libertarians may have strong beliefs and values that guide their actions.
