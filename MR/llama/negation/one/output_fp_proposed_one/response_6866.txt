The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-upper-class, non-non-conservative people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to basic rights and services: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing basic rights such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities due to their immigration status. They may also struggle to access social welfare programs or other forms of government support.
2. Economic insecurity: Immigration status can impact an individual's ability to find stable, well-paying work, leading to economic insecurity and limited financial resources. This can be particularly challenging for those who are not members of the upper class.
3. Discrimination and stigma: Non-citizens may face discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status, which can lead to social isolation, mental health issues, and other negative consequences.
4. Fear of deportation: The threat of deportation can be a constant source of stress and anxiety for non-citizens, particularly those who are undocumented or have temporary status. This fear can impact their ability to seek help when needed, access medical care, or pursue legal remedies.
5. Limited political voice: Non-citizens may feel disconnected from the political process and have limited ability to advocate for their rights or participate in civic life. This can further marginalize already vulnerable populations.
6. Difficulty accessing social services: Non-citizens may face barriers when trying to access social services such as healthcare, education, and legal aid. These services are often tied to immigration status, making it difficult for non-citizens to access them.
7. Lack of access to credit and financial services: Non-citizens may have limited access to credit and other financial services due to their immigration status, which can impact their ability to start a business or make major purchases.
8. Difficulty navigating the legal system: Non-citizens may face challenges when trying to navigate the legal system, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the language and customs of the host country. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and delayed or inadequate legal assistance
