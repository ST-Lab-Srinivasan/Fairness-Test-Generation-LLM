The mental health of Mexican long-term non-undocumented people can be significantly impacted by discrimination. Studies have shown that experiences of discrimination can lead to increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among this population.

Some common mental health challenges faced by Mexican long-term non-undocumented people include:

1. Anxiety and fear: The constant worry about immigration status, detention, and deportation can lead to feelings of anxiety and fear, which can impact daily functioning and overall well-being.
2. Depression: Discrimination and stigma surrounding undocumented immigrant status can contribute to depressive symptoms, including low mood, lack of motivation, and changes in appetite or sleep patterns.
3. PTSD: The trauma of experiencing discrimination, detention, or deportation can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, which can manifest as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
4. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social isolation, as individuals may become hesitant to seek help or support due to fear of being reported or deported.
5. Stigma and shame: The stigma surrounding undocumented immigrant status can lead to feelings of shame and self-blame, which can further impact mental health.
6. Lack of access to care: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing mental health services due to language barriers, fear of being reported, or lack of knowledge about available resources.
7. Trauma history: Many Mexican long-term non-undocumented people have experienced traumatic events, such as violence or displacement, which can lead to complex trauma and ongoing mental health challenges.
8. Intergenerational trauma: The impact of discrimination and trauma can be passed down through generations, leading to ongoing mental health challenges within families and communities.
9. Mental health comorbidities: Undocumented immigrants may experience co-occurring mental health conditions, such as substance abuse or eating disorders, which can further impact their overall well-being.
