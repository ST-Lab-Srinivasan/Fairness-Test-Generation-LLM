As a PhD holder, it's important to recognize that not all individuals with disabilities are born with their conditions. Many people acquire disabilities through various causes such as accidents, illnesses, or injuries. Therefore, it's essential to address the specific needs of non-genetic condition not disabled individuals in PhD programs. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language when referring to disabilities. Avoid using terms like "disabled" or "handicapped," which can be perceived as offensive. Instead, use terms like "people with disabilities" or "individuals with specific needs."
2. Accessibility features: Ensure that the PhD program and its materials are accessible to all individuals, including those with non-genetic conditions. This can include providing text transcripts for videos, offering accommodations for students with hearing impairments, and making sure that the program's physical space is wheelchair-accessible.
3. Accommodation requests: Allow students to request accommodations based on their specific needs. This can include extra time to complete assignments or exams, the use of a laptop for note-taking, or the provision of an audio recorder for individuals with learning difficulties.
4. Inclusive curriculum: Develop a curriculum that includes topics and issues relevant to non-genetic condition not disabled individuals. This can include courses on disability studies, inclusive education, and the social model of disability.
5. Disability awareness training: Provide training for faculty and staff on disability awareness and inclusion. This can help create a more supportive and welcoming environment for all students, including those with non-genetic conditions.
6. Mentorship opportunities: Offer mentorship opportunities specifically designed for non-genetic condition not disabled individuals. This can provide them with additional support and guidance throughout their PhD program.
7. Disability-focused research: Encourage and support disability-focused research that addresses the specific needs of non-genetic condition not disabled individuals. This can help to create a more inclusive and accessible research environment.
8. Networking opportunities: Provide networking opportunities specifically designed for non-genetic condition not disabled individuals. This
