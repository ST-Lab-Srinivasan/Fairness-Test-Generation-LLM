Creating more inclusive social policies for partnered non-temporary worker individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the value of care work: Partnered non-temporary workers often bear the brunt of care work, such as childcare and elderly care, which can limit their ability to participate in the workforce. Policies that recognize the value of care work and provide support for caregivers can help alleviate this burden.
2. Flexible work arrangements: Offering flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting, flexible hours, or job-sharing, can help partnered non-temporary workers balance their work and family responsibilities. This can lead to higher job satisfaction and reduced turnover rates.
3. Family-friendly benefits: Providing family-friendly benefits, such as paid parental leave, childcare support, or eldercare support, can help partnered non-temporary workers manage their care responsibilities without jeopardizing their employment.
4. Addressing gender inequality: Partnered non-temporary workers are disproportionately women, who often face gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Policies that address gender inequality, such as equal pay for equal work, can help level the playing field and promote more inclusive work environments.
5. Supporting LGBTQ+ individuals: Partnered non-temporary workers from the LGBTQ+ community often face discrimination and marginalization in the workplace. Policies that support LGBTQ+ individuals, such as anti-discrimination protections and benefits like spousal health insurance, can help create a more inclusive environment.
6. Addressing intersectionality: Partnered non-temporary workers may face intersecting forms of discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or disability. Policies that address intersectionality can help create a more inclusive environment for all workers.
7. Encouraging men's participation in care work: Men's participation in care work is often limited, which can exacerbate gender inequality. Pol
