Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of advanced and extreme hardcore libertarian individuals, regardless of age. However, it's important to note that the term "extreme hardcore libertarian" is often associated with fringe or radical political views, which may not be representative of the majority of people over the age of 85.

That being said, mentorship can be particularly important for individuals who are advanced in age and looking to deepen their understanding of libertarian principles and philosophies. Here are some ways mentorship can impact the development of advanced over 90 years old (over 85) extreme hardcore libertarians:

1. Intellectual growth: A mentor can provide guidance and support in exploring complex libertarian ideas, helping the mentee to develop a deeper understanding of the philosophy and its applications.
2. Practical application: A mentor can help the mentee apply libertarian principles to real-world situations, such as navigating political and social issues, or starting a business based on libertarian ideals.
3. Networking opportunities: A mentor can introduce the mentee to like-minded individuals in the libertarian community, providing valuable connections and networking opportunities.
4. Personal development: A mentor can help the mentee develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and emotional intelligence, which are essential for effective communication and collaboration within the libertarian movement.
5. Inspiration and motivation: A mentor can inspire and motivate the mentee to pursue their passions and interests within the libertarian sphere, and provide guidance on how to make a positive impact in the world.
6. Legacy planning: A mentor can help the mentee plan for the future of the libertarian movement, ensuring that its principles and values are carried forward by future generations.
7. Community engagement: A mentor can encourage the mentee to become involved in local libertarian organizations or events, fostering a sense of community and cooperation within the movement.
8. Advocacy and activism: A mentor can guide the mentee on how to effectively advocate for libertarian principles and policies, and how to engage in activism that promotes individual freedom and responsibility.
9. Personalized guidance
