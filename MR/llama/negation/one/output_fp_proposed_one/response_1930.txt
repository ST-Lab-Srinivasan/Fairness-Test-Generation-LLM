Mexican nominal non-Christians, like any other individual, have the right to pursue their professional aspirations without facing discrimination or marginalization. Here are some ways to support and promote inclusivity in the workplace:

1. Lead by example: As a leader, you can set an example by promoting diversity and inclusion in your own workplace. This can involve actively seeking out and hiring diverse candidates, providing training on unconscious bias and cultural competency, and creating a safe and inclusive work environment.
2. Provide mentorship opportunities: Offer mentorship programs that pair nominal non-Christian employees with more experienced colleagues who can provide guidance and support in their professional development. This can help build confidence and skills, and create a sense of belonging in the workplace.
3. Recognize and celebrate diverse holidays and traditions: Encourage employees to share their cultural practices and traditions by recognizing and celebrating them in the workplace. This can involve incorporating diverse holidays and traditions into company events and celebrations, or simply respecting and learning about these practices.
4. Offer training on cultural competency: Provide training on cultural competency and unconscious bias to help employees understand and appreciate the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of their colleagues. This can involve workshops, webinars, or other forms of training that promote cross-cultural understanding and empathy.
5. Create a employee resource group: Establish an employee resource group (ERG) for nominal non-Christian employees to connect with one another, share experiences and support each other in their professional development. This can help create a sense of community and belonging within the workplace.
6. Provide flexible work arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting or flexible hours to accommodate the religious and cultural practices of nominal non-Christian employees. This can help promote a more inclusive work environment and allow employees to balance their work and personal obligations.
7. Address microaggressions: Create a zero-tolerance policy for microaggressions in the workplace, and provide training on how to recognize and address these incidents. Encourage employees to speak up if they experience or witness microaggressions,
