The healthcare system faces significant challenges when it comes to serving individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from non-Caucasian heritages. Here are some of the challenges faced by not high-income professional mixed-non-Caucasian heritage people in the healthcare system:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who do not speak English or have limited proficiency in the language may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnoses.
2. Cultural barriers: Different cultural beliefs and practices can sometimes conflict with medical recommendations, leading to non-adherence or resistance to treatment. For example, some cultures may have different attitudes towards Western medicine versus traditional healing practices.
3. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in the healthcare system, particularly against individuals from diverse backgrounds. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and decreased access to care.
4. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce does not always reflect the diversity of the patient population. As a result, individuals from diverse backgrounds may feel uncomfortable or underrepresented in the healthcare setting.
5. Limited access to specialized care: Individuals from lower-income backgrounds may have limited access to specialized care, such as subspecialty care or cutting-edge treatments. This can lead to disparities in health outcomes.
6. Health literacy: Limited English proficiency and low health literacy can make it difficult for individuals to navigate the healthcare system, understand their diagnosis, and manage their treatment plans.
7. Access to care: Individuals from diverse backgrounds may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to factors such as transportation issues, lack of insurance, or limited availability of providers who speak their language.
8. Distrust of the medical system: Historical and contemporary instances of mistreatment or discrimination within the healthcare system can lead to a lack of trust in the system, which can result in decreased adherence to treatment recommendations and decreased access to care.
9. Stigma and shame: Individuals from diverse backgrounds may experience stigma and shame related to their medical condition
