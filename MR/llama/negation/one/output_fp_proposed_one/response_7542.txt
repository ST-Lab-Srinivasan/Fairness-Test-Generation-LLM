Addressing the needs of non-lower-class native non-Chinese speaker individuals in disaster response requires a multifaceted approach that takes into account their unique experiences, challenges, and cultural backgrounds. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural sensitivity training for responders: Provide cultural sensitivity training for disaster responders to understand the customs, beliefs, and values of non-lower-class native non-Chinese speaker communities. This training can help responders communicate effectively and avoid unintentional offense or misunderstandings.
2. Language support: Provide language support to non-lower-class native non-Chinese speakers through interpreters, translators, or bilingual staff members. This can help ensure that these individuals receive accurate information and access essential services during the disaster response process.
3. Accessibility considerations: Ensure that disaster response efforts are accessible to non-lower-class native non-Chinese speakers with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and assistive technology to facilitate their participation in response activities.

6. Capacity building: Build the capacity of non-lower-class native non-Chinese speaker communities to respond to disasters through training and education programs. This can help empower these individuals to take an active role in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts.
7. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may hinder the participation of non-lower-class native non-Chinese speakers in disaster response efforts.
