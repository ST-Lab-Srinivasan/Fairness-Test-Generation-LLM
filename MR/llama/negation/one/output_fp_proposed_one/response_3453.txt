Introduction:
Naturalizing as a citizen of a country can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly for those who were previously undocumented or had a different immigration status. As a non-independent researcher, I aim to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of recently naturalized citizen non-independent people. This research will examine the various ways in which immigration status can affect an individual's access to rights and opportunities, as well as their overall well-being.

 Literature Review:
The literature on immigration status and its impact on individuals is vast and complex. Research has shown that individuals with a non-citizen immigration status often face significant barriers to accessing basic rights and services, such as healthcare, education, and employment (Haines & Mussell, 2017). For example, undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of deportation or lack of access to health insurance (Barnes et al., 2015). Additionally, naturalized citizens may face discrimination and marginalization based on their immigration status (Knight & Fotiadou, 2017).

 Methodology:
To conduct this research, I will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with recently naturalized citizen non-independent individuals. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and immigrant advocacy groups. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on the experiences and challenges faced by these individuals, including their access to rights and opportunities.

Significance:
This research aims to contribute to the existing literature on immigration status and its impact on individuals. By examining the experiences of recently naturalized citizen non-independent people, this study will provide valuable insights into the ways in which immigration status can affect an individual's quality of life. Findings from this research can inform policy and practice recommendations aimed at improving the well-being of these individuals and promoting greater inclusivity and social cohesion.
