3. Limited access to culturally competent care: Ethnically diverse African individuals may have limited access to healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about their culture and can provide culturally competent care.

5. Discrimination and bias: Ethnically diverse African individuals may face discrimination and bias within the healthcare system, which can affect their care and well-being.
6. Lack of trust: Ethnically diverse African individuals may have difficulty trusting the healthcare system due to historical and ongoing systemic injustices, leading to a lack of adherence to treatment plans or avoidance of medical care altogether.

8. Health disparities: Ethnically diverse African individuals may experience health disparities due to a lack of cultural competency in the healthcare system, leading to poorer health outcomes compared to other populations.
9. Limited availability of culturally appropriate resources: Ethnically diverse African individuals
