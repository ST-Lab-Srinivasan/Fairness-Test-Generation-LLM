Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers who are ethnically full non-Caucasian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Understand the diversity of your audience: Recognize that your participants come from diverse backgrounds, and tailor your programs accordingly. Include examples and references that resonate with each group's cultural identity.
2. Use language and terminology appropriate for the group: Avoid using terms or phrases that may be offensive or insensitive to particular groups. Be mindful of the words you use when describing different cultures, traditions, and practices.
3. Provide opportunities for participation: Encourage all participants to share their thoughts, experiences, and perspectives. Use interactive activities and discussions that allow everyone to actively engage with the content.
4. Incorporate diverse voices and stories: Make sure your program includes a variety of voices and perspectives from different ethnic backgrounds. Share stories, music, art, and other cultural expressions that reflect the diversity of your participants.
5. Be sensitive to power dynamics: Be aware of the historical and systemic inequalities that exist between different racial and ethnic groups. Be mindful of how these power dynamics may impact your program and work to create an inclusive environment for all participants.
6. Provide cultural context: Offer contextual information about each culture, including their history, traditions, and values. This will help participants better understand the cultural practices and beliefs they are learning about.
7. Use visual aids and multimedia: Utilize images, videos, and other visual aids to help participants better understand different cultures. This can also make the program more engaging and interactive for all participants.
8. Involve community leaders and experts: Collaborate with community leaders and cultural experts from diverse backgrounds to develop and deliver your programs. This will add authenticity and credibility to your program and help ensure that it is culturally sensitive.
9. Be open to feedback and adjustments: Encourage participants to provide feedback on the program, and be willing to make changes based on their input. This will help you refine your approach and create a more inclusive environment for all participants.
