I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or marginalization based on someone's sexual orientation or gender identity. Everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Community organizations can play a crucial role in supporting individuals who identify as openly non-homosexual, extreme soft libertarian, or any other marginalized group. These organizations can provide a safe space for people to connect with others who share similar experiences and struggles, and offer support and resources to help them navigate their lives.

However, it's important to recognize that no one should be forced to conform to societal expectations or norms that do not align with their identity. Everyone has the right to express themselves freely and live their lives in a way that is authentic and fulfilling to them.

In conclusion, community organizations can play a positive role in supporting individuals who identify as openly non-homosexual, extreme soft libertarian, or any other marginalized group. However, it's important to recognize the importance of respecting and valuing diversity, and promoting inclusivity and acceptance for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
