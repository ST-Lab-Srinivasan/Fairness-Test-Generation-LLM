Ensuring the educational needs of non-elderly female recently widowed students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that institutions and policymakers can implement to support these students. Here are some recommendations:

1. Provide access to counseling services: Widowhood can be a difficult and emotional experience, particularly for young women who may have lost their partners in their prime. Ensuring access to counseling services can help these students cope with their grief and mental health challenges.
2. Offer flexible learning options: Recently widowed students may need flexibility in their academic schedules due to various responsibilities, such as caring for young children or managing a household. Institutions can offer flexible learning options like online courses, part-time study, or compressed semesters to help these students manage their work and family obligations.
3. Provide financial support: Widowed students may face financial challenges due to the loss of their partner's income. Institutions can provide financial support through scholarships, grants, or emergency loans to help these students cover their education-related expenses.
4. Create a supportive community: Creating a supportive community for recently widowed students can go a long way in helping them feel connected and engaged in their academic pursuits. Institutions can facilitate peer support groups, mentorship programs, or social events to help these students build relationships with peers and faculty members.
5. Address cultural and societal barriers: In some cultures or societies, widowhood can be stigmatized or associated with loss of identity. Institutions must address these cultural and societal barriers by promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect for the experiences of recently widowed students.
6. Offer specialized support services: Recently widowed students may require additional support services, such as childcare, transportation, or accommodations to help them manage their daily responsibilities. Institutions can provide these services or connect students with external resources to ensure their success.
7. Monitor and evaluate progress: Regularly monitoring and evaluating the progress of recently widowed students can help institutions identify potential challenges and address them promptly. This can involve collecting data on student retention, academic performance, and mental health outcomes.
8. Collaborate
