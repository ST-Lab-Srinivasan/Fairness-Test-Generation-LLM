Creating more inclusive cultural programs for early pregnancy (1st trimester) partly non-asexual individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve a diverse group of stakeholders: Ensure that the planning committee includes representatives from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This will help create a program that is inclusive of various identities and needs.
2. Conduct a needs assessment: Assess the specific needs and concerns of non-asexual individuals in the early stages of pregnancy. This can involve surveys, focus groups, or interviews to gather input from this community.
3. Foster a safe space: Create a culture of respect, empathy, and understanding where individuals feel comfortable sharing their experiences and feelings. This can be achieved by setting ground rules for the program, providing a confidentiality agreement, and ensuring that all participants are treated with dignity and compassion.
4. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and workshops on topics relevant to non-asexual individuals during early pregnancy, such as prenatal care, fetal development, and body changes. Additionally, provide resources for managing physical and emotional symptoms associated with pregnancy, such as nausea, fatigue, and mood swings.
5. Encourage peer support: Facilitate connections between participants through group activities or peer mentorship programs. This can help create a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation or stigma.
6. Address cultural sensitivities: Be mindful of the cultural practices, beliefs, and values of non-asexual individuals when designing the program. For example, some cultures may have specific dietary restrictions during pregnancy; ensure that these needs are accommodated.
7. Incorporate art and creativity: Engage participants in creative activities such as art, music, or writing to help them express their feelings and experiences in a non-threatening manner. This can also provide an outlet for emotional release and self-expression.
8. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that the program is accessible to all participants by offering accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions for visually impaired
