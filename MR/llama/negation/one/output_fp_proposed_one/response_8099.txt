Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-divorced individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the venue is wheelchair accessible, has ramps or elevators, and that there is adequate space for mobility aids like scooters or walkers. Provide audio descriptions or braille materials for visually impaired individuals.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communication materials, such as avoiding gendered terms or using "people" instead of "men" or "women." Be mindful of ableist language and terminology that may be offensive or marginalizing.
3. Accommodations for different abilities: Offer a variety of activities and entertainment options to cater to different abilities, such as ASL interpretation, live captioning, or audio descriptions. Provide quiet spaces for individuals who may need a break from the noise and commotion.
4. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by minimizing distractions and overstimulation. This can be achieved by using dim lighting, reducing noise levels, and providing a calm atmosphere.
5. Involve diverse individuals in planning process: Ensure that the cultural celebration is planned and executed by a diverse group of people, including individuals with disabilities, to ensure that their needs are taken into account and represented.
6. Flexibility: Offer flexible seating options, such as cushions or chairs with armrests, to accommodate different mobility needs. Allow attendees to bring their service animals if needed.
7. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness materials on disability etiquette and inclusive practices during the cultural celebration. This can help promote understanding and respect for individuals with disabilities.
8. Accessible menu options: Offer a variety of food options that are accessible to individuals with different dietary needs, such as gluten-free, vegan, or halal options. Provide clear labeling and descriptions of the food options.
9. Sign language interpretation: Provide sign language interpretation for Deaf and hard of hearing individuals during key events or performances.
