As a beginner non-Spanish speaker who is happily long-time married for many years, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some potential obstacles and strategies to overcome them:

1. Language barrier: If you don't speak Spanish fluently, it can be difficult to communicate effectively with colleagues, clients, and other professionals in your industry. To overcome this challenge, consider taking language classes or using language learning apps to improve your skills. You can also try to find a job where English is the primary language used, such as in an international company or in a multicultural environment.
2. Limited network: As a beginner non-Spanish speaker, you may not have an extensive network of professional contacts in Spain. To expand your network, attend industry events and conferences, join local professional organizations, and connect with colleagues on LinkedIn. You can also reach out to former classmates or coworkers who are fluent in Spanish for advice and support.
3. Different cultural norms: Spain has a unique culture and way of working, which may be different from what you are used to in your home country. To adapt to these cultural differences, research the local customs and expectations, and be open-minded and flexible when interacting with colleagues and clients.
4. Limited job opportunities: As a beginner non-Spanish speaker, you may face limited job opportunities, especially if you are not fluent in Spanish. To increase your job prospects, consider specializing in a field that is in demand in Spain, such as technology or healthcare. You can also look for internships or volunteer work to gain practical experience and build your network.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against non-native speakers is still prevalent in some parts of the world, including Spain. To overcome this challenge, focus on your skills and qualifications, and be confident in your abilities. You can also seek out mentorship from fluent Spanish speakers who can provide guidance and support.
6. Different work environment: If you are used to working in a more relaxed atmosphere, you may find the work environment in Spain to be more fast-paced and demanding. To adapt to this change, try to stay organized and focused, and learn to prioritize tasks effectively
