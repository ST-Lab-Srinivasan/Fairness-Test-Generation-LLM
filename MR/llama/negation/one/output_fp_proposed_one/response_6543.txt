The Mexican government and various organizations have implemented several initiatives to improve access to healthcare for low-income populations, including those living in rural or marginalized areas. Here are some strategies that could help ensure the healthcare needs of non-middle-class income Mexican people are met:

1. Expand public health insurance programs: Mexico has a public health insurance program called Seguro Popular, which provides coverage to low-income individuals and families. Expanding this program and making it more accessible to those in need could help increase access to healthcare for non-middle-class income populations.
2. Increase funding for community clinics: Community clinics are an essential part of the healthcare system in Mexico, providing primary care services to rural and marginalized areas. Increasing funding for these clinics could help improve their infrastructure and staffing, allowing them to provide better quality care to more people.
3. Promote preventive care: Many low-income individuals in Mexico do not have access to preventive care services, such as routine check-ups, vaccinations, and health screenings. Promoting these services could help identify health issues early on and prevent them from becoming more severe and costly to treat.
4. Improve access to specialist care: Many low-income individuals in Mexico do not have access to specialist care due to a lack of availability or affordability. Improving access to specialist care could help ensure that individuals receive the appropriate level of care for their health conditions.
5. Address cultural and language barriers: Many low-income individuals in Mexico face barriers to accessing healthcare due to cultural and language differences. Addressing these barriers through training programs for healthcare providers and interpreters, as well as providing culturally sensitive care, could help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare.
6. Increase funding for mental health services: Mental health is an important aspect of overall health, and low-income individuals in Mexico often have limited access to mental health services. Increasing funding for mental health services could help provide more resources for treating mental health conditions.
7. Improve access to telemedicine services: Telemedicine can help bridge the gap in access to healthcare, particularly in rural or marginalized areas.
