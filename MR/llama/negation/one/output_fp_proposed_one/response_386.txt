As a Jew who is familiar with the customs and practices of Orthodox Judaism, I understand the challenges that newly single Orthodox non-Jewish individuals in college may face. Here are some suggestions on how to address their specific needs:

1. Provide support groups: Organize support groups specifically for recently single Orthodox individuals in college. These groups can provide a safe space for them to share their experiences, receive emotional support, and connect with others who understand their challenges.
2. Offer mentorship programs: Pair recently single Orthodox individuals with experienced mentors who can offer guidance on navigating college life as a single person. These mentors can provide advice on everything from managing academic responsibilities to finding social support.
3. Create a safe space for observance: Many newly single Orthodox individuals may feel pressure to conform to the college party culture. To address this, create a designated area or space on campus where they can observe Shabbat and other Jewish practices without feeling judged or ostracized.
4. Promote inclusivity and diversity: Encourage the college community to embrace and respect the religious beliefs and practices of Orthodox students. Organize events that celebrate the diverse cultures and traditions present on campus, including those related to Judaism.
5. Provide resources for spiritual support: Offer resources such as a rabbi or spiritual advisor who can provide guidance on spiritual growth and development. This can help newly single Orthodox individuals navigate their faith and identity during this time of transition.
6. Foster connections with the broader Jewish community: Encourage recently single Orthodox individuals to connect with the larger Jewish community in the area. This can be done by hosting events that bring together Jews from different denominations and backgrounds, fostering interfaith dialogue, and promoting community service projects that benefit the wider Jewish community.
7. Address financial challenges: Many newly single Orthodox individuals may face financial challenges due to the loss of financial support from their spouse or partner. Offer financial aid, scholarships, or other forms of assistance to help them cover their college expenses.
8. Provide academic support: Recently single Orthodox individuals may need additional academic support due to the emotional challenges they are facing. Offer tutoring services, study groups, and other resources
