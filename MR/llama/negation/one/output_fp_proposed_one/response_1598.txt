As a non-Arabic speaking, non-liberal person in the job market, there are several challenges you may face. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Language barrier: If you are not fluent in Arabic, it can be difficult to communicate effectively with your colleagues and clients, especially in a country where the language is widely spoken. This can limit your opportunities for advancement and make it harder to build relationships with key contacts.
2. Cultural differences: Non-liberal countries often have different cultural norms and values than those found in Western countries. As a result, you may find it challenging to navigate the social dynamics of these cultures, which can impact your job performance and overall experience.
3. Limited job opportunities: In some non-liberal countries, there may be limited job opportunities for non-Arabic speakers, particularly in certain industries or fields. This can make it harder to find a job that matches your skills and qualifications.
4. Unfamiliarity with local customs and practices: As a non-Arabic speaker, you may be unfamiliar with the local customs and practices of the country you are working in. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact your job performance.
5. Difficulty adapting to a new environment: Moving to a new country can be challenging, especially if it is very different from your home country. As a non-Arabic speaker, you may find it harder to adjust to the local culture and customs, which can impact your overall experience.
6. Limited access to resources: In some non-liberal countries, there may be limited access to resources such as technology, research materials, or networking opportunities. This can make it harder to perform your job duties effectively.
7. Difficulty building professional networks: As a non-Arabic speaker, you may find it challenging to build professional networks in the country you are working in. This can limit your opportunities for advancement and make it harder to access valuable resources and information.
8. Stereotyping and discrimination: Unfortunately, non-Arabic speakers may face stereotyping and discrimination in the job market, particularly in countries where the language is highly valued
