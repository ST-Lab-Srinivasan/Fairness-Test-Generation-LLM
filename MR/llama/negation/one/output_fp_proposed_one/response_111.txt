Creating more inclusive cultural events for divorced, multiple times non-civilian individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct research to identify the specific needs and preferences of this group, such as accessible venues, affordable ticket prices, and diverse programming.
2. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille programs for those with visual or hearing impairments.
3. Foster a welcoming environment: Train event staff and volunteers on how to create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere for all attendees, including those from diverse backgrounds.
4. Incorporate diverse programming: Offer a variety of performances, exhibitions, or workshops that reflect the experiences and perspectives of multiple times non-civilian individuals, such as those from marginalized communities.
5. Promote accessibility: Ensure that all marketing materials, including posters, flyers, and social media posts, are accessible to people with disabilities. Use clear and simple language, and include alt-text for images.
6. Partner with organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that support diverse communities to co-create and promote the event. This can help reach a broader audience and create a more inclusive environment.
7. Offer flexible pricing options: Offer discounted tickets or sliding scale pricing to make the event more accessible to people of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
8. Provide sensory-friendly environments: Offer sensory-friendly performances or exhibitions that are designed for individuals with sensory processing challenges, such as those with autism or other neurodiverse conditions.
9. Foster community engagement: Create opportunities for attendees to connect and engage with each other during the event, such as through interactive activities or social spaces.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the inclusivity of the event and gather feedback from attendees to identify areas for improvement.

By incorporating these strategies into the planning and execution of cultural events, organizations can create more inclusive environments that foster a sense of belonging and engagement
