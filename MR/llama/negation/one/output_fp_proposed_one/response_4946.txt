Promoting the accessibility of public services for Native American citizens, including those who are cisgender and non-elderly, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for public servants to ensure they understand and respect the customs, beliefs, and values of Native American communities. This will enable them to provide more effective and sensitive service delivery.
2. Language Accessibility: Ensure that public services are accessible in Native American languages, such as Navajo, Cherokee, and Lakota. Provide interpreters or translated materials for those who speak these languages.
3. Geographical Accessibility: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas with limited access to transportation. Provide transportation options, such as buses or shuttles, to ensure that individuals can access public services without difficulty.
4. Accessible Infrastructure: Ensure that public buildings and facilities are accessible for individuals with disabilities. This includes wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
5. Technology Accessibility: Provide technology options for individuals who may not have access to the internet or mobile devices. This can include computers at public libraries or community centers, or mobile hotspots that can be checked out for use in remote areas.
6. Community Outreach: Engage in regular community outreach and engagement activities to ensure that Native American citizens are aware of the services available to them. This can include cultural events, health fairs, and other community gatherings.
7. Collaboration with Tribal Governments: Work closely with tribal governments to ensure that public services are tailored to meet the unique needs of their communities. This can include collaborating on service delivery models, sharing best practices, and providing technical assistance as needed.
8. Flexible Service Delivery: Offer flexible service delivery options to accommodate the diverse schedules and needs of Native American citizens. For example, provide evening or weekend hours for individuals who may have difficulty accessing services during regular business hours.
9. Public Awareness Campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns to educate Native American communities about the availability of public services and how to access them. This can include radio ad
