Lower-income natural-born Indian non-citizen people face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of access to legal representation: Lower-income individuals may not have the means to afford legal representation, which can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and access justice.
2. Language barriers: Many lower-income Indian non-citizens may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties in communicating with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals.
3. Limited knowledge of legal rights and procedures: Lower-income individuals may not be aware of their legal rights and procedures, which can lead to them being taken advantage of or unfairly treated within the legal system.

5. Limited access to legal resources: Lower-income individuals may not have access to legal resources such as libraries, legal aid organizations, or other resources that can help them navigate the legal system.
6. Barriers to citizenship: Lower-income Indian non-citizens may face barriers to obtaining citizenship due to complex and lengthy naturalization processes, which can limit their access to certain legal rights and protections.
7. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system may not be culturally competent in addressing the needs of lower-income Indian non-citizens, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can harm their legal interests.
8. Limited access to social services: Lower-income individuals may not have access to social services such as healthcare, education, and housing, which can impact their ability to access justice within the legal system.
9. Lack of political power: Lower-income Indian non-citizens may not have the same level of political power as other groups, which can limit their ability to advocate for their legal rights and interests.
