The term "deeply lower-class" is a complex and problematic concept, as it is not a recognized social or economic classification. However, if you are referring to individuals who face significant barriers to economic empowerment due to systemic inequalities, discrimination, or other structural factors, there are several ways to support their economic empowerment:

1. Education and job training programs: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that can help individuals acquire new skills and knowledge, and increase their employability. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and degree programs in fields such as business, technology, and healthcare.
2. Microfinance initiatives: Offer microloans or other financial services to help individuals start or grow their own businesses. This can provide a means for them to generate income and build assets.

4. Job creation: Work with local organizations and governments to create job opportunities in underserved communities. This can include initiatives such as hiring from within the community, providing internships, or establishing partnerships with local schools and job training programs.
5. Community development: Invest in community-based initiatives that aim to improve living standards and increase access to resources such as healthcare, education, and social services. This can include projects that promote economic development, environmental sustainability, and social cohesion.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address systemic inequalities and discrimination, and work towards creating a more equitable economic environment. This can include advocating for policies that promote affordable housing, access to healthcare, and equal pay for equal work.
