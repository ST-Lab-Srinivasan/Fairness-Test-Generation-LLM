Promoting the artistic talents of beginner non-Chinese speakers in their late 30s can be challenging, but there are several ways to support and encourage them. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide opportunities for practice: Encourage them to join language exchange events or groups where they can practice speaking Chinese with native speakers. This will help them gain confidence in their abilities and improve their language skills.
2. Offer feedback and support: Provide constructive feedback on their pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary use. Encourage them to ask questions and seek clarification when they are unsure about something.
3. Create a supportive environment: Encourage them to surround themselves with other beginners who share the same goals and interests. This can help them stay motivated and engaged in the learning process.
4. Celebrate small victories: Acknowledge and celebrate their progress, no matter how small. This will help build their confidence and motivation to continue learning.
5. Provide access to resources: Share resources such as language learning apps, podcasts, and videos that can help them learn Chinese in a more efficient and enjoyable way.
6. Encourage cultural immersion: Suggest they watch Chinese movies, listen to Chinese music, or read Chinese literature to get a better understanding of the culture and language.
7. Offer personalized coaching: If possible, offer one-on-one coaching or tutoring sessions to help them improve their language skills more quickly and effectively.
8. Create a community: Encourage them to join online communities or forums where they can connect with other Chinese learners and share their experiences.
9. Provide opportunities for creative expression: Encourage them to express themselves through art, music, or writing in Chinese. This can help them practice their language skills while also exploring their creativity.
10. Be patient and supportive: Learning a new language takes time and effort, so it's important to be patient and supportive throughout the process. Encourage them to keep practicing and remind them that progress may be slow at times, but it is possible with consistent effort.
