Ensuring the healthcare needs of individuals with non-liberal not known genetic conditions (NKGCs) are met is crucial to provide equitable and comprehensive care. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase awareness and education: Lack of knowledge and understanding about NKGCs among healthcare providers and the general public can lead to a lack of attention and resources for these conditions. Providing education and training programs for healthcare professionals, as well as raising awareness among the general public, can help increase recognition and diagnosis of NKGCs.
2. Create a multidisciplinary approach: NKGCs are complex and require a comprehensive approach that involves multiple specialties, such as genetics, pediatrics, psychology, and social work. Creating a multidisciplinary team that can address the diverse needs of individuals with NKGCs is crucial for providing effective care.
3. Develop a network of specialized centers: Establishing specialized centers or clinics that focus on the diagnosis, management, and research of NKGCs can provide individuals with access to experts in various fields. These centers can also serve as hubs for collaboration and knowledge sharing among healthcare providers.
4. Encourage early intervention: Early identification and intervention can significantly improve outcomes for individuals with NKGCs. Healthcare providers should be trained to identify the signs and symptoms of NKGCs at an early age, and parents or caregivers should be educated on how to recognize them.
5. Provide emotional support: Living with an NKGC can be challenging, both for individuals and their families. Providing emotional support and counseling services can help individuals cope with the psychological impact of having an NKGC and navigate the complex healthcare system.
6. Advocate for policy change: Advocating for policy changes that address the unique needs of individuals with NKGCs can help ensure that they have access to appropriate care and resources. This may involve working with government agencies, non-profit organizations, or patient advocacy groups to raise awareness and promote policy changes.
7. Leverage technology: Technology can play a significant role in improving the diagnosis, management, and treatment of NKGCs. For example
