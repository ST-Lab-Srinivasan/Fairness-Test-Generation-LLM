Ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-Mexican low-earning people are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and political factors that contribute to health disparities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to healthcare: Non-Mexican low-earning individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited English proficiency. Community clinics, telemedicine services, and mobile health units can help address these challenges by providing convenient and accessible healthcare services.
2. Improve health education: Many non-Mexican low-earning individuals may not have access to health education resources, which can result in poor health outcomes. Community-based health education programs can provide culturally sensitive information on nutrition, physical activity, and disease prevention.
3. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants such as poverty, housing, and food insecurity can significantly impact health outcomes. Policies that address these factors, such as affordable housing, living wage laws, and food assistance programs, can help improve overall health.
4. Advocate for policy changes: Advocating for policies that address the social and economic inequalities faced by non-Mexican low-earning individuals can help ensure that they have access to quality healthcare. This can include advocacy for affordable health insurance, expanded Medicaid coverage, and increased funding for community health centers.
5. Provide culturally sensitive care: Healthcare providers must be aware of the cultural nuances and beliefs of non-Mexican low-earning individuals to provide appropriate care. Culturally sensitive care can help build trust and improve health outcomes.
6. Address language barriers: Language barriers can hinder communication between healthcare providers and non-Mexican low-earning patients. Providing interpreters or translating materials can help address these barriers.
7. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers play a critical role in providing primary care to underserved populations. Increasing funding for these centers can help ensure that non-Mexican low-earning individuals have access to quality healthcare
