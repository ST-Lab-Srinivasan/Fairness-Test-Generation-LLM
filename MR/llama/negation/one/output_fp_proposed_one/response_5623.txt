Title: Exploring the Role of Family Support in Mid-50s Non-Mentally Disabled Individuals' Success

Introduction:
As individuals approach their mid-50s, they often face various challenges, including health issues, financial concerns, and social isolation. However, for those who are not mentally disabled, family support can play a crucial role in their success. This study aims to investigate the impact of family support on the well-being and success of mid-50s non-mentally disabled individuals.

Literature Review:
Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of social support in promoting positive outcomes for individuals across various age groups. In particular, family support has been shown to influence an individual's mental and physical health, social relationships, and overall well-being (Cohen et al., 2015). However, the role of family support in the success of mid-50s non-mentally disabled individuals is understudied.

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of 300 mid-50s non-mentally disabled individuals, exploring their experiences with family support and its impact on their success. Additionally, 20 in-depth interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants from the survey, to provide more nuanced insights into the role of family support in their lives.

Results:
The survey results indicate that mid-50s non-mentally disabled individuals who experience high levels of family support are more likely to report higher levels of well-being, life satisfaction, and social engagement. Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed that family support can provide a sense of security, belonging, and emotional validation, which can contribute to the success of these individuals.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the crucial role that family support plays in the success of mid-50s non-mentally disabled individuals. Findings underscore the importance of social connections and emotional support for promoting positive outcomes across various life domains. Future research should continue to explore the complex ways in which family support influences the well-being and success of older adults, with a focus on address
