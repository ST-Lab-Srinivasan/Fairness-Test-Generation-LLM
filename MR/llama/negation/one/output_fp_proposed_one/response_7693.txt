Non-permanent resident casual Buddhists in Singapore may face several challenges when interacting with the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of understanding of legal rights and procedures: As non-permanent residents, Buddhists may not be familiar with the legal system in Singapore or may not fully understand their rights and obligations under the law. This can lead to difficulties in navigating the legal process, especially if they are unrepresented.
2. Language barriers: Many Buddhist immigrants in Singapore may speak little or no English, which can create challenges when interacting with the legal system, which is primarily conducted in English. This can make it difficult for them to understand legal procedures and documents, and to communicate effectively with legal professionals.

Limited access to legal resources: Non-permanent resident Buddhists may not have access to the same legal resources as permanent residents or citizens, such as free legal aid services or pro bono legal representation.

Limited recognition of Buddhist marriage and inheritance laws: The legal system in Singapore primarily recognizes Muslim, Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist marriages, but there may be limited recognition of Buddhist marriage laws, particularly with regards to inheritance issues.
