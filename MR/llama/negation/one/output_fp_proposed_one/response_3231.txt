Ensuring the educational needs of native non-Spanish speaker very old (90s+) students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Assess their cognitive abilities: Conduct regular assessments to evaluate the student's cognitive abilities, memory, and problem-solving skills. This will help identify any areas of difficulty and inform teaching approaches.
2. Use simple language and materials: Use simple language and materials that are easy to understand for students with limited proficiency in Spanish. Provide visual aids, such as pictures and videos, to support learning.
3. Adapt instructional methods: Use adaptive techniques, such as repetition, reinforcement, and spaced practice, to help students learn new information.
4. Provide additional support: Offer additional support, such as one-on-one tutoring or small group instruction, to help students who may need extra help.
5. Foster a supportive learning environment: Create a supportive and inclusive learning environment that encourages student participation and engagement. Encourage classroom discussions and activities that promote social interaction and collaboration.
6. Utilize technology: Utilize technology, such as audio books, e-books, and language learning apps, to provide students with additional learning resources and opportunities for practice.
7. Provide cultural context: Provide cultural context for the material being taught to help students understand the relevance and importance of the information.
8. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage older students to connect with younger students and share their knowledge and experiences. This can help build bridges between different age groups and create a sense of community.
9. Offer flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options, such as afternoon or evening classes, to accommodate the schedules of very old students who may have difficulty attending traditional class times.
10. Collaborate with other organizations: Collaborate with other organizations that serve older adults, such as senior centers and retirement communities, to reach a wider audience and provide additional learning opportunities.

By implementing these strategies, educators can help ensure that the educational needs of native non-Spanish speaker very old (90s+) students are met and that they have access to quality education throughout their lives.
