As a combat recently retired veteran, there are several important support systems that can help you navigate the challenges of transitioning back to civilian life. As a Native American non-citizen living in the United States, you may face additional barriers and challenges, but there are still many resources available to support your well-being and success. Here are some key support systems to consider:

1. Healthcare: The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides comprehensive healthcare services to eligible veterans, including mental health services, medical care, and prescription medication. You can also access healthcare services through the Indian Health Service (IHS), which is a federal program that provides healthcare services to American Indians and Alaska Natives.
2. Mental Health Support: Combat veterans often experience high levels of stress, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The VA offers mental health services, including counseling, therapy, and support groups. You can also reach out to organizations such as the Wounded Warrior Project or the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America for additional support.
3. Employment Support: Transitioning from military to civilian life can be challenging when it comes to finding employment. The VA offers job placement services, resume building workshops, and interview preparation. You can also reach out to organizations such as the USO or Hire Heroes USA for additional support.
4. Education and Training: The VA offers education and training benefits to help veterans pursue higher education or vocational training. You can also explore programs such as the GI Bill or the Yellow Ribbon Program, which provide additional financial support.
5. Peer Support: Connecting with other veterans who have gone through similar experiences can be incredibly helpful in navigating the challenges of civilian life. The VA offers peer support groups and mentorship programs, as well as organizations such as the Disabled American Veterans or the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
6. Community Support: Building a strong network of friends, family, and community can help you feel more connected and supported in your transition back to civilian life. Consider joining local veteran organizations or participating in community events to connect with other veterans and their families.
