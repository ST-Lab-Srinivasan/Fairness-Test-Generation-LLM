As an AI language model, I do not have access to personal information or the identities of individuals. However, I can provide general suggestions on how to support the educational aspirations of non-civilian people who are native English speakers:

1. Encourage and motivate: Offer encouragement and support to help them pursue their educational goals. Encourage them to set achievable targets and reward themselves for small accomplishments along the way.
2. Provide resources and tools: Offer access to learning materials, study guides, and online courses that can help them improve their language skills. You could also provide access to a tutor or language coach who can offer personalized guidance and support.
3. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Ensure that the learning environment is safe, welcoming, and free from discrimination or harassment. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among learners.
4. Foster collaboration: Encourage learners to work together on language-related projects or activities. This can help build teamwork and communication skills while also promoting a sense of community and belonging.
5. Provide opportunities for cultural exchange: Arrange cultural events, language exchanges, or other activities that allow non-civilian learners to interact with native English speakers. These opportunities can help broaden their understanding of different cultures and languages.
6. Address individual needs: Recognize that each learner has unique strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles. Offer tailored support and resources to address these individual needs and help learners reach their full potential.
7. Encourage continuous learning: Emphasize the importance of lifelong learning and encourage non-civilian learners to continue improving their language skills beyond the initial learning phase. This can involve setting long-term goals, tracking progress, and celebrating small victories along the way.
8. Provide mentorship opportunities: Offer mentorship opportunities with experienced teachers or language professionals who can provide guidance, support, and feedback throughout the learning process.
9. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage learners to embrace challenges and view them as opportunities for growth. Reinforce the idea that intelligence and ability can be developed through dedication and effort.
