Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of physically disabled individuals, particularly those who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: People with disabilities may face barriers when accessing healthcare services due to language or cultural differences, discrimination, or lack of knowledge about their rights. Immigrants may encounter additional challenges in finding providers who speak their native language or understand their cultural background.
