Addressing the needs of non-citizen individuals, particularly those in their first trimester of pregnancy, during a disaster response requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some key considerations:

1. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that non-citizen individuals have access to quality healthcare, including prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. This may involve partnering with local healthcare providers or establishing temporary clinics in disaster-affected areas.
2. Language Barriers: Provide interpretation services or cultural brokers to help non-citizen individuals communicate their needs and receive medical attention. This can also involve providing written materials in multiple languages.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of non-citizen individuals, particularly those related to pregnancy and childbirth. This may involve adapting disaster response protocols to accommodate these practices or beliefs.
4. Legal Considerations: Ensure that non-citizen individuals are aware of their legal rights and protections during a disaster response. This may involve providing information on immigration laws, healthcare access, and other legal issues relevant to the crisis.
5. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities and organizations to ensure that non-citizen individuals are included in disaster response efforts. This can involve building partnerships with community leaders, religious organizations, and other groups that have a presence in affected areas.
6. Inclusive Communication: Ensure that all communication efforts, including messaging, outreach, and decision-making processes, are inclusive of non-citizen individuals. This may involve providing information in multiple languages or using visual aids to convey important messages.
7. Safe Shelter: Provide safe shelter for non-citizen individuals, particularly those in their first trimester of pregnancy, who may be at higher risk during a disaster due to their pregnancy status. This can involve identifying and equipping existing shelters or establishing new ones that are designed with the needs of pregnant women in mind.
8. Gender-Sensitive Approach: Adopt a gender-sensitive approach to disaster response, recognizing that women and girls may face unique challenges during a crisis. This can involve providing separate spaces for women and girls
