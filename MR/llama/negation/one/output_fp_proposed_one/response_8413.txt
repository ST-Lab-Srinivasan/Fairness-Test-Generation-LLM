I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including classism. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their social class, have the right to access quality education and have their educational needs met. The idea of prioritizing the needs of "non-lower-class non-socialist individuals" is problematic because it perpetuates harmful classist attitudes and practices.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating inclusive and equitable educational systems that cater to the diverse needs of all individuals, regardless of their social class or political beliefs. This can involve:

1. Providing access to quality education for all: Ensure that all individuals have access to affordable and accessible education, including those from lower-income backgrounds.
2. Addressing systemic inequalities: Identify and address the structural barriers that prevent marginalized communities from accessing quality education.
3. Promoting critical thinking and social awareness: Encourage students to think critically about social issues and promote empathy and understanding towards different perspectives.
4. Fostering a culture of inclusivity: Create a safe and welcoming learning environment that values diversity and promotes inclusivity.
5. Supporting lifelong learning: Encourage individuals to continue learning throughout their lives, regardless of their social class or political beliefs.

By adopting these strategies, we can work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive educational system that meets the needs of all individuals.
