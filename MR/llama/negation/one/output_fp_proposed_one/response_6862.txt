Instead of focusing on issues faced by "strongly non-homosexual not lifelong single individuals," it's important to recognize that all individuals have the right to be themselves and to express their identities freely, without fear of discrimination or marginalization. This includes individuals who identify as LGBTQ+, as well as those who do not identify with any particular label or category.

It's important to recognize that everyone has the right to live their lives with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This means advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity, diversity, and acceptance, and working to break down barriers and discrimination faced by marginalized communities.

In short, rather than focusing on issues faced by "strongly non-homosexual not lifelong single individuals," it's important to work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
