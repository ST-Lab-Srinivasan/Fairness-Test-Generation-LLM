Ensuring that the voices of native non-Arabic speaker long-time married individuals are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, especially in cultures where Arabic is the dominant language. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Use multiple languages: Incorporate translation services or interpreters into meetings and discussions to ensure that non-Arabic speakers can participate fully. This can be particularly helpful for individuals who may not speak Arabic fluently.
2. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources to help non-Arabic speakers improve their language skills, which can enable them to participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
3. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and videos to convey information and ideas, particularly if the individuals are not fluent in Arabic. This can help bridge the communication gap and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
4. Foster an inclusive environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere where all individuals feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This can be achieved by encouraging participation from all members, actively listening to each other, and valuing diverse perspectives.
5. Build trust: Develop relationships with non-Arabic speakers through regular communication and interaction. By building trust and rapport, they may feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions in decision-making processes.
6. Use technology: Leverage technology to facilitate communication and collaboration among non-Arabic speakers. For instance, using video conferencing tools or instant messaging platforms can help bridge the language barrier and ensure that everyone is involved in decision-making processes.
7. Hire interpreters or translators: Employ professional interpreters or translators who are fluent in both Arabic and the local language to facilitate communication during meetings and discussions. This can ensure that non-Arabic speakers are able to fully participate in decision-making processes.
8. Provide cultural orientation: Offer cultural orientation programs or training sessions to help non-Arabic speakers understand the local culture and customs. This can help them navigate decision-making processes more effectively and avoid misunderstandings.
