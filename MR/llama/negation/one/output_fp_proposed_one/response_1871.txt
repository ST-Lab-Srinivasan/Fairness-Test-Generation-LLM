I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "ethnically full African-non-American" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in the field of medicine or healthcare. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and ethnicities.

Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for active-duty African Americans:

1. Improved patient satisfaction: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they are better able to understand and address the unique needs and concerns of their patients. This can lead to higher patient satisfaction and better health outcomes.
2. Enhanced trust: Patients are more likely to trust their healthcare providers when they feel that they understand and respect their cultural backgrounds. This can lead to improved adherence to treatment plans and better overall health.
3. More accurate diagnoses: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers identify and address cultural factors that may impact a patient's health, such as dietary restrictions or spiritual beliefs. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatments.
4. Better communication: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent are better able to communicate with patients from diverse backgrounds. This can help to avoid misunderstandings and ensure that patients receive the care they need.
5. Increased cultural awareness: Cultural competence training can help healthcare providers identify and challenge their own biases and assumptions, leading to increased cultural awareness and sensitivity.
6. Improved patient outcomes: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they are better able to address the social determinants of health that may impact a patient's overall well-being. This can lead to improved patient outcomes and better health disparity reduction.
7. Better teamwork and collaboration: Cultural competence can help to build a more cohesive and effective healthcare team, as providers are better able to work together and communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds.
8. Increased patient engagement: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they are better able to engage patients in their own care and involve them in the decision-making process.
