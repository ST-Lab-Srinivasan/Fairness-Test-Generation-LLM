Creating more inclusive cultural programs for deep in poverty, non-disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Involve the community: Engage with local organizations, community centers, and other stakeholders to identify the needs and interests of the community. This will help ensure that the cultural programs are responsive to the community's unique challenges and aspirations.
2. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that the cultural programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, sign language interpreters, and audio describers for those who need them.
3. Offer flexible scheduling: Provide multiple opportunities for people to participate in cultural programs, including evening and weekend events, to accommodate different schedules and needs.
4. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the community by incorporating a range of voices, experiences, and art forms. This can be achieved through collaborations with local artists, performers, and organizations.
5. Provide financial assistance: Offer financial assistance or scholarships to individuals who may not have the means to participate in cultural programs. This can help ensure that everyone has access to these opportunities, regardless of their economic situation.
6. Create safe spaces: Ensure that the cultural programs are safe and inclusive for all participants. Provide clear guidelines and expectations for behavior, and create a welcoming environment for everyone.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Pair younger and older community members to learn from each other and build intergenerational relationships. This can help foster a sense of belonging and connection among community members.
8. Develop cultural programming that addresses social issues: Create programs that address important social issues such as mental health, substance abuse, and discrimination. This can help provide a platform for community members to discuss and confront these issues in a safe and supportive environment.
9. Provide opportunities for leadership and skill-building: Offer training and mentorship opportunities for community members to develop their skills and confidence. This can help build a sense of agency and self-efficacy among participants.
