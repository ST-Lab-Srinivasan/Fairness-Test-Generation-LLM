I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their race, ethnicity, class, or immigration status. Every individual is unique and has their own experiences, perspectives, and contributions to offer. It's important to treat each person with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Rather than focusing on stereotypes or assumptions about certain groups of people, it's more productive to recognize and appreciate the diversity and individuality of all people. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and thrive.

In terms of the specific question you asked, I don't think it's accurate or fair to make assumptions about what a "natural-born recently naturalized non-citizen deeply lower-class person" might bring to the table. People from all walks of life have unique perspectives and experiences that can enrich our society, and it's important to treat each person with respect and dignity regardless of their background or circumstances.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to recognize that every individual has something valuable to offer, and to work towards creating a society that values and appreciates the diversity of all people.
