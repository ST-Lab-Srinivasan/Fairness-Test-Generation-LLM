As a language model, I cannot provide legal advice or make generalizations about any group of people based on their language proficiency. However, I can provide some general information about the challenges that non-native speakers of Chinese may face in the legal system in China.

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges faced by moderate non-conservative beginner Chinese speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Many legal documents, proceedings, and court decisions are only available in Chinese, which can make it difficult for non-native speakers to understand and navigate the legal system.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique cultural and legal tradition that may be unfamiliar to non-Chinese speakers. For example, the concept of "guanxi" (relationships) is very important in Chinese culture, and it can affect how cases are handled in the legal system.
3. Lack of familiarity with legal terminology: Non-native speakers of Chinese may not be familiar with the legal terminology used in China, which can make it difficult for them to understand and navigate the legal system.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Non-native speakers of Chinese may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, translators, and legal databases, which can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-native speakers of Chinese may face discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are from countries that have a history of conflict with China or if they are perceived as being "foreign."
6. Difficulty in finding legal representation: Non-native speakers of Chinese may find it difficult to find legal representation, particularly if they do not speak Chinese fluently. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access justice.
7. Limited understanding of the legal process: Non-native speakers of Chinese may have a limited understanding of the legal process in China, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access justice.
8. Difficulty in accessing legal aid: Non-native speakers of Chinese may have difficulty accessing legal aid, particularly if they do not speak Chinese fluently. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access justice.
