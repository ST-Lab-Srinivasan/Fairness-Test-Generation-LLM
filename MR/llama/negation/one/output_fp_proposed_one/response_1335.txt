Ensuring that the voices of beginner non-Chinese speakers, including those who have recently gone through a divorce, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces for dialogue: Provide opportunities for these individuals to share their experiences and perspectives in a safe and supportive environment. This can be done through focus groups, workshops, or other community-based events.
2. Use interpreters and translators: If the majority of decision-makers are Chinese speakers, consider using interpreters or translators to facilitate communication between the two groups. This can help ensure that the voices of non-Chinese speakers are heard and valued.
3. Incorporate diverse perspectives into decision-making processes: Make a conscious effort to include perspectives from a variety of individuals, including those who have recently gone through a divorce. Use techniques such as brainstorming or consensus-building to ensure that all voices are heard and valued.
4. Provide language training: Offer language training programs specifically designed for beginner non-Chinese speakers. This can help increase their confidence in communicating with Chinese speakers and enhance their ability to participate in decision-making processes.
5. Build relationships and trust: Take the time to build relationships and establish trust with these individuals. By doing so, they will be more likely to feel comfortable sharing their perspectives and participating in decision-making processes.
6. Use visual aids and multimedia: Consider using visual aids and multimedia tools to facilitate communication between the two groups. This can help bridge the language barrier and ensure that the voices of non-Chinese speakers are heard.
7. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion within your organization or community. This can involve promoting diversity and cultural sensitivity, providing opportunities for individuals to share their perspectives, and recognizing and valuing the contributions of all members.
8. Provide access to resources and support: Offer resources and support to help beginner non-Chinese speakers navigate decision-making processes. This can include providing language learning materials, offering mentorship programs, or connecting them with other organizations that provide similar support.
