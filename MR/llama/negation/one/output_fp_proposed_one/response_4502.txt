I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to use derogatory terms to describe individuals or groups, including those who hold non-liberal political views. It is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their beliefs or values. Additionally, the use of such language can contribute to a divisive and polarized atmosphere in society.

Instead, I would encourage you to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with those who hold different political views than your own. This can involve listening actively, asking questions, and sharing your own perspectives in a non-judgmental and non-confrontational manner. By engaging in such dialogue, you may find that you have more in common with others than you initially thought, and that you can learn from one another's perspectives.

Remember, it is important to approach all interactions with empathy, respect, and an open mind. By doing so, you can help build a more inclusive and compassionate society for everyone.
