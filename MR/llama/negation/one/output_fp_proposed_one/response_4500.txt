The role of cultural heritage can vary greatly among documented non-Nigerian people, as their individual experiences and backgrounds shape how they engage with and value their cultural traditions. However, some common ways that cultural heritage plays a role in the lives of documented non-Nigerian people include:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can play a significant role in shaping the identity of individuals who are not Nigerian. It can provide a sense of belonging and connection to a larger community, as well as a framework for understanding one's own beliefs, values, and practices.
2. Cultural exchange: Documented non-Nigerian people may engage in cultural exchange with their Nigerian counterparts, sharing their own cultural traditions and learning about those of others. This can foster mutual understanding and respect, as well as provide opportunities for personal growth and development.
3. Community building: Cultural heritage can serve as a unifying force within communities of documented non-Nigerian people, providing a shared framework for understanding and interacting with one another. It can also help to build bridges between different ethnic or cultural groups, facilitating communication and cooperation.
4. Preservation and transmission: Many documented non-Nigerian people may feel a strong sense of responsibility to preserve and transmit their cultural heritage to future generations. This can involve passing on traditional practices, language, and beliefs to children and grandchildren, as well as participating in cultural events and activities that celebrate one's heritage.
5. Personal fulfillment: Engaging with one's cultural heritage can bring a sense of personal fulfillment and purpose, particularly when it is done in a way that is meaningful and authentic. This can involve exploring and expressing one's cultural identity through art, music, dance, or other forms of creative expression.
6. Resistance and activism: For some documented non-Nigerian people, engaging with their cultural heritage may also involve resisting or challenging systems of oppression that seek to marginalize or erase their cultural identities. This can involve advocating for the rights and dignity of one's community, as well as working to create more inclusive and equitable social structures.
