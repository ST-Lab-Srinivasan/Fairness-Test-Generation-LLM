To ensure that the educational needs of native non-French speaker newly married students are met, here are some strategies that institutions can consider:

1. Offer language support: Provide language classes or resources specifically designed for non-French speakers to help them improve their French language skills and navigate academic life in France.
2. Create inclusive learning environments: Make sure that classroom materials, presentations, and other learning resources are available in both French and the students' native languages. This can help non-French speakers follow along and participate more easily.
3. Provide cultural orientation: Offer cultural orientation programs or workshops to help newly married students adapt to French culture and customs. This can include information on how to navigate everyday situations, such as shopping, using public transportation, and interacting with neighbors and colleagues.
4. Encourage peer support: Connect non-French speakers with other students who are also navigating the educational system in France. This can help them feel less isolated and more supported in their academic journey.
5. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for non-French speakers to connect with other students, faculty members, and staff. This can help them build relationships and feel more connected to the university community.
6. Provide resources for spouses: Offer resources and support specifically designed for spouses of international students, including language classes, cultural orientation, and social events.
7. Develop partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that provide language and cultural support to non-French speakers. This can help supplement the university's own resources and provide additional support to students.
8. Provide academic advising: Ensure that non-French speakers have access to academic advisors who can help them navigate the university's curriculum and degree requirements in their native language.
9. Offer flexible learning options: Provide flexible learning options, such as online courses or part-time study, to help non-French speakers balance their academic responsibilities with other commitments, such as work or family obligations.
10. Monitor and evaluate progress: Regularly monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies in meeting the educational needs of non-French speakers. Use this information to make adjustments and improvements
