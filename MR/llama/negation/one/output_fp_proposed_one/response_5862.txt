Title: Examining the Impact of Marital Status on Beginner Chinese Speakers' Lives as Binary Identifying Individuals

Introduction:
Marriage and sexuality are complex and multifaceted concepts that have far-reaching impacts on an individual's life. In China, there is a growing trend towards acceptance of same-sex relationships, but the social stigma surrounding them remains. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as binary (i.e., straight or gay) and are actively embracing their identity.

Theoretical Framework:
This study will draw upon the theories of sexuality and identity to understand how marital status affects the lives of beginner Chinese speakers. The social constructionist theory posits that identity is constructed through interactions with society, while the identity formation theory suggests that individuals form their identities based on personal experiences and social norms.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, employing semi-structured interviews to collect data from 20 beginner Chinese speakers who identify as binary and are actively embracing their identity. Participants will be recruited through online advertisements and social media platforms, ensuring a diverse range of participants in terms of age, gender, and sexual orientation.

Data Analysis:
The interview data will be analyzed using thematic analysis, which involves identifying patterns and meanings within the data. The findings will be organized into themes related to marital status, such as social pressure, family dynamics, and personal growth.

Expected Findings:
This study aims to uncover the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as binary and are actively embracing their identity. The findings are expected to reveal how social pressure, family dynamics, and personal growth shape the experiences of these individuals. Some possible themes that may emerge include:

1. Social pressure: Participants may discuss the challenges they face in terms of societal expectations, such as the pressure to conform to traditional gender roles or the stigma surrounding same-sex relationships.
2. Family dynamics: Participants may share their experiences of coming out to family members, including the emotional support they received and any
