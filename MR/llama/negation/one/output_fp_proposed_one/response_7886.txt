Ensuring the educational needs of native English speaker non-citizens requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural competency training for educators: Provide training on cultural diversity, equity, and inclusion to help teachers understand the needs and experiences of non-citizen students. This can involve learning about different cultures, beliefs, and practices, as well as developing empathy and respect for students from diverse backgrounds.
2. Language support: Offer language support services such as English language learners (ELL) programs, bilingual education programs, or language classes specifically designed for non-citizen students. These programs can help students improve their English proficiency and academic performance.
3. Academic accommodations: Provide appropriate academic accommodations to help non-citizen students succeed in school. This may include extended time to complete assignments, note-taking assistance, or use of a computer for exams.
4. Counseling services: Offer counseling services specifically designed for non-citizen students who may be experiencing academic and social challenges related to their immigration status. These services can help students build resilience and coping skills.
5. Community outreach and partnerships: Develop partnerships with local organizations that support immigrant communities, such as language schools, community centers, or advocacy groups. These partnerships can provide additional resources and support for non-citizen students and their families.
6. Policy advocacy: Advocate for policies that support the educational needs of non-citizen students, such as in-state tuition rates for undocumented students or funding for language support programs.
7. Curriculum diversification: Incorporate diverse perspectives and histories into the curriculum to better reflect the experiences and backgrounds of non-citizen students. This can involve adding courses on different cultures, religions, or social issues related to immigration.
8. Teacher training: Provide teachers with training on how to teach students from diverse backgrounds and how to create an inclusive learning environment. This may involve learning about culturally responsive teaching practices, trauma-informed teaching, or how to address microaggressions in the classroom.
