As a libertarian, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system as a non-French speaker. Here are some potential difficulties you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in France is primarily conducted in French, which can create a significant obstacle for non-French speakers. You may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documentation, making it harder to navigate the system effectively.
