As a non-native French speaker and an Arabic speaker, navigating the legal system in France can present several challenges. Here are some of the common difficulties that native Arabic speakers may face:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in France is primarily conducted in French, which can create a significant language barrier for non-French speakers. This can make it difficult to understand court proceedings, legal documents, and other important information related to the case.
