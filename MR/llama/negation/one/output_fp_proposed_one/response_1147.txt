Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner non-French speaker mixed-Caucasian heritage individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Understand the diversity of the group: It is essential to understand that the term "mixed-Caucasian heritage" encompasses a wide range of cultures, ethnicities, and backgrounds. Conduct research to learn about the diverse experiences, traditions, and customs within this group.
2. Involve the community: Engage with the mixed-Caucasian heritage community by soliciting feedback, suggestions, and participation in the program's development. This will help ensure that the program is responsive to the needs and interests of the community.
3. Provide language support: Many non-French speaker individuals may face challenges participating in cultural programs due to a lack of proficiency in French. Offer language support, such as translation services or language classes, to ensure equal participation.
4. Highlight diverse perspectives: Include a variety of voices and experiences in the cultural program. This can be done by featuring artists, musicians, writers, and other cultural practitioners from diverse backgrounds.
5. Create inclusive content: Develop cultural programs that celebrate and showcase the diversity of mixed-Caucasian heritage individuals. Use a variety of mediums, such as visual arts, music, dance, and literature, to tell their stories and experiences.
6. Ensure accessibility: Make sure that the cultural program is accessible to all, regardless of age, ability, or location. Offer virtual or remote participation options for those who may not be able to attend in person.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where mixed-Caucasian heritage individuals feel valued and appreciated. Encourage intercultural dialogue and exchange, and provide opportunities for participants to connect with each other.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that may exist within the mixed-Caucasian heritage community. Be aware of the ways in which privilege and marginalization intersect, and work to create a more equitable and inclusive environment.
