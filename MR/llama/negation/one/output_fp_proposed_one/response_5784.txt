Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-native individuals, including those who are not in a romantic relationship. Here are some ways cultural heritage can impact an individual's identity:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. Non-native individuals may feel a connection to their adopted culture, but they may also experience feelings of disconnection from their cultural heritage.
