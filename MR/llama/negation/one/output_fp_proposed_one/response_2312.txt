Supporting ethnically full non-Asian communities during the third trimester of pregnancy can be challenging, as these communities may face unique barriers and discrimination. Here are some effective strategies for supporting them:

1. Culturally sensitive care: Provide care that is sensitive to the cultural beliefs and practices of the community.
