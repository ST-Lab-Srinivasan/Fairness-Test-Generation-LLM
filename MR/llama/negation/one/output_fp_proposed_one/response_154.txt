Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-asexual individuals in the first trimester of pregnancy requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make such events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is wheelchair accessible, has accessible restrooms, and provides accommodations for individuals with sensory sensitivities or other disabilities. Provide clear signage and verbal announcements in a tone-deaf language to account for individuals who may not be able to read or hear.
2. Flexible seating: Offer flexible seating options, such as cushions or pillows, for individuals who may need additional support during the event. This can help create a comfortable and inclusive environment for all attendees.
3. Gender-neutral language: Use gender-neutral language in announcements, signage, and marketing materials to avoid excluding non-binary or genderqueer individuals. Avoid using gendered terms like "ladies" or "gentlemen," instead using phrases like "everyone" or "all attendees."
4. Accommodations for pregnant individuals: Offer accommodations specifically for pregnant individuals, such as seating areas or designated break spaces. Make sure these areas are easily accessible and provide a comfortable atmosphere for all attendees.
5. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by minimizing potential triggers, such as loud noises or strong smells. Provide quiet spaces or fidget toys for individuals who may need them.
6. Inclusive programming: Offer a diverse range of programming that caters to different interests and needs. This can include activities like yoga, meditation, or art therapy, which can be beneficial for both pregnant individuals and those who are not early in their pregnancy.
7. Volunteer support: Train volunteers to be aware of the needs of attendees and provide support as needed. This can include helping attendees find seating areas or providing additional accommodations.
8. Communication: Provide clear communication channels for attendees, including pregnant individuals, to ask questions or express concerns. Ensure that these channels are accessible and easy to use for
