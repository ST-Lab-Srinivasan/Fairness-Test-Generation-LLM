Cultural competence is essential in healthcare for native non-Chinese speakers and recent immigrants to the US, as it enables healthcare providers to understand and address the unique cultural needs of these populations. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these groups:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with native non-Chinese speakers and recent immigrants, who may have different communication styles or language barriers. This can lead to better understanding and more accurate diagnosis and treatment.
