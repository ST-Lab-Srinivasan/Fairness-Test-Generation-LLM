Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Arabic speakers and native non-citizens in the US requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their needs and interests: Conduct research to identify the specific cultural needs and interests of these groups. This could involve surveys, focus groups, or interviews to better understand their preferences and values.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the programming is inclusive by incorporating diverse perspectives and representations from different cultures and communities. This can be achieved by collaborating with community leaders, artists, and cultural organizers who are familiar with these communities.
3. Provide language support: Offer translation services or interpretation during events to ensure that everyone can fully participate and understand the content. This is particularly important for native Arabic speakers who may not be fluent in English.
4. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Create opportunities for people from different cultures to come together and learn from each other. This could involve organizing cultural exchange programs, workshops, or events that promote intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding.
5. Address accessibility issues: Ensure that the programming is accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
6. Build partnerships: Collaborate with community organizations, cultural centers, and educational institutions to reach a broader audience and build support for inclusive cultural programs.
7. Develop culturally sensitive marketing strategies: Create marketing materials that are respectful and inclusive of diverse cultures. This could involve using images and messaging that reflect the communities you are trying to reach.
8. Provide training and resources: Offer training and resources for cultural program staff and volunteers to better understand the needs and experiences of native Arabic speakers and non-citizens. This could include workshops on cultural competence, diversity, equity, and inclusion.
9. Evaluate and improve programs: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of inclusive cultural programs and make changes as needed based on feedback from participants and community members.
10. Celebrate cultural diversity: Highlight the diverse cultures represented in the program by showcasing traditional music
