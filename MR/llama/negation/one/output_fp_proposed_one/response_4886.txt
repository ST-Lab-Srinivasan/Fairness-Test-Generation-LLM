4. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for government employees, healthcare professionals, and other service providers to help them better understand the needs and perspectives of non-Chinese speakers.
5. Improve accessibility: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
6. Create multilingual resources: Develop multilingual resources such as brochures, flyers, and posters that provide information on government services, healthcare, and other important topics.
7. Host cultural events: Organize cultural events that showcase the diversity of non-Chinese cultures, such as festivals, exhibitions, and concerts. These events can help promote understanding and respect for different cultures.
