Immigrants who are not living in deep poverty but are still struggling to access healthcare in the US face a number of challenges. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system and communicate their needs to healthcare providers.
2. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of immigrant populations, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
3. Limited access to care: Immigrants may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to lack of insurance, lack of transportation, or lack of knowledge about available resources.
4. Discrimination: Immigrants may experience discrimination in the healthcare system, including language discrimination, cultural discrimination, and discrimination based on their immigration status.
5. Documentation challenges: Immigrants may face difficulties obtaining the necessary documentation to access healthcare services, such as a lack of health insurance cards or confusion about which documents are required for different types of care.
6. Difficulty finding culturally competent providers: Finding healthcare providers who are knowledgeable and sensitive to the needs of immigrant populations can be challenging.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Immigrants may face barriers to accessing specialized care, such as language barriers or lack of familiarity with the healthcare system in their home country.
8. Difficulty navigating complex billing and insurance systems: Immigrants may struggle to understand the complex billing and insurance systems in the US, leading to confusion or unexpected costs.
9. Limited access to preventive care: Immigrants may face barriers to accessing preventive care, such as routine check-ups or screenings, due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about available resources.
10. Difficulty advocating for their rights: Immigrants may face challenges advocating for their rights within the healthcare system, including difficulty navigating complaint processes or seeking legal advice.

It is important to note that these challenges can vary depending on factors such as the immigrant's country of origin, length of time
