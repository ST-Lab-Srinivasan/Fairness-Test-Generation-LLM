Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for ethnically full African-non-American Orthodox Jewish individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and acknowledge the rich diversity of African and non-American Jewish cultures: It's essential to recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to celebrating cultural events. Instead, consider how you can incorporate elements from a variety of African and non-American Jewish cultures to create a more inclusive atmosphere.
2. Involve diverse members of the community: Include individuals from different ethnic backgrounds in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations. This will help ensure that the event is representative of the entire community and that everyone feels valued and involved.
3. Offer cultural programming: Provide educational workshops, performances, or other activities that showcase the diverse cultural traditions within the Orthodox Jewish community. For example, you could host a traditional African or non-American Jewish dance performance, or offer a cooking class featuring dishes from different ethnic backgrounds.
4. Celebrate multiple holidays and events: Acknowledge the various cultural traditions within the community by celebrating multiple holidays and events throughout the year. For example, you could host a African-themed Purim party or a non-American Jewish-themed Hanukkah celebration.
5. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the venue and atmosphere of cultural celebrations are inclusive and welcoming to all attendees. This can be achieved by using language and decorations that reflect the diversity of the community, and by providing accommodations for individuals with disabilities or other accessibility needs.
6. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Facilitate opportunities for members of the community to share their cultural traditions and practices with one another. This can help build bridges between different ethnic groups and foster a sense of mutual respect and understanding.
7. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with organizations that support diversity and inclusion in your community. This can help leverage resources, expertise, and networks to create more inclusive cultural celebrations.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the historical and contemporary power dynamics within the Orthodox Jewish community
