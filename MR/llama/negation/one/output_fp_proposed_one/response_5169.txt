The impact of political affiliation on the lives of non-Mandarin late teenagers (ages 18-19) can be significant, especially in China where the political climate is heavily controlled by the Communist Party. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited freedom of expression: Non-Mandarin speakers may face challenges expressing their opinions or beliefs due to language barriers, leading to a lack of representation and limited opportunities for political participation.
2. Discrimination and marginalization: Members of minority groups may experience discrimination and marginalization, particularly if they are not fluent in Mandarin, which can limit their access to education, employment, and other resources.
3. Restricted access to information: Non-Mandarin speakers may have limited access to information about political issues, events, and policies, as much of the official discourse is conducted in Mandarin. This can lead to a lack of understanding and engagement with political matters.
4. Limited career opportunities: In a highly centralized and bureaucratic system like China's, proficiency in Mandarin can be seen as a requirement for advancement in the workplace. Non-Mandarin speakers may face barriers to career advancement and representation in certain fields.
5. Social stigma: Non-Mandarin speakers may experience social stigma or discrimination due to their language proficiency, particularly if they are seen as "not fully Chinese." This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion from mainstream society.
6. Limited cultural engagement: Non-Mandarin speakers may have limited access to cultural events, festivals, and other activities that are primarily conducted in Mandarin. This can limit their opportunities for cultural engagement and expression.
7. Lack of representation: Non-Mandarin speakers may feel underrepresented or invisible in the political sphere, leading to a lack of voice and agency in shaping policies and decisions that affect their lives.
8. Limited participation in civic activities: Non-Mandarin speakers may face barriers to participating in civic activities such as voting, protests, or community organizing due to language barriers.
9. Lack of access to resources: Non-Mandarin speakers
