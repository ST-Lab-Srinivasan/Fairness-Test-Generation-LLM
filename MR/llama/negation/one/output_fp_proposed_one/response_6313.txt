Promoting the inclusion of individuals with non-genetic conditions, such as those with intellectual or developmental disabilities, in professional athletics is an important step towards greater diversity and inclusivity in sports. Here are some strategies that can help promote this inclusion:

1. Education and awareness: Educate coaches, athletes, and sports organizations about the potential of individuals with non-genetic conditions to participate in sports and compete at a high level. Highlight the abilities and strengths of these individuals and dispel any misconceptions or stigmas that may exist.
2. Adaptive sports programs: Establish adaptive sports programs that provide opportunities for individuals with non-genetic conditions to participate in sports that are tailored to their abilities. These programs can include modified rules, equipment, and training methods to ensure that everyone has a fair and equal chance to compete.
3. Inclusive hiring practices: Ensure that sports organizations and teams have inclusive hiring practices that consider candidates with non-genetic conditions. This can include providing job opportunities for individuals with disabilities in coaching, training, and other roles within the organization.
4. Accessible facilities: Ensure that sports facilities are accessible and inclusive for individuals with non-genetic conditions. This can include wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions of game action for individuals who are visually impaired.
5. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship and support to individuals with non-genetic conditions who are interested in pursuing a career in sports. This can include connecting them with experienced coaches and athletes, and providing guidance on how to navigate the sports industry.
6. Changing attitudes and perceptions: Challenge ableist attitudes and perceptions within the sports industry by promoting positive representations of individuals with non-genetic conditions. Highlight their achievements and contributions to sports, and encourage others to do the same.
7. Partnerships and collaborations: Collaborate with organizations that support individuals with non-genetic conditions to promote their inclusion in sports. This can include partnering with disability sports organizations, advocacy groups, and community organizations.
8. Creating inclusive policies and procedures: Develop and implement inclusive policies and procedures within sports organizations
