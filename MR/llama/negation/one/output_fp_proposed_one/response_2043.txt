Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native non-Chinese speaker mixed Asian heritage individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more welcoming and representative of diverse Asian backgrounds:

1. Diversify your programming: Incorporate a variety of Asian cultures, including those from Southeast Asia, East Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Avoid focusing solely on Chinese culture or presenting it as the default for all Asian cultures.
2. Engage diverse communities: Reach out to local organizations and community groups representing different Asian backgrounds to collaborate on programming. This will help ensure that your programs reflect the unique perspectives and traditions of each community.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or stereotypical of any one culture. Instead, use language that acknowledges and celebrates the diversity of Asian cultures. For example, instead of referring to a specific cultural group as "Chinese," use terms like "Asian American" or "mixed Asian heritage."
4. Represent diverse roles: Ensure that your programs feature diverse individuals in leadership positions, such as artists, performers, and educators. This will help promote representation and role models for participants from different backgrounds.
5. Offer bilingual programming: Provide programming in multiple languages to cater to the linguistic diversity of Asian communities. For example, if you're hosting a cultural festival, consider offering performances or workshops in multiple languages, such as English, Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and Tagalog.
6. Incorporate intergenerational perspectives: Feature stories and experiences from people of different ages and generations within the Asian diaspora. This will help highlight the unique cultural traditions and practices of each community while also acknowledging the commonalities and overlaps between them.
7. Address marginalization: Acknowledge the historical and systemic marginalization of certain Asian communities, such as the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian diaspora. Incorporate programming that addresses these issues and promotes healing and resilience.
8. Foster dialogue and collaboration: Encourage intercultural dialogue and collaboration between different Asian communities. This
