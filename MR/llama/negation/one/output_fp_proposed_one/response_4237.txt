Low-income transgender individuals encounter numerous difficulties when accessing medical care within the healthcare system. Here are some of the challenges they face:

1. Lack of knowledge and understanding: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the unique needs and experiences of low-income transgender patients, leading to a lack of culturally competent care.
2. Limited access to gender-affirming care: Low-income individuals may struggle to access gender-affirming surgeries or hormone therapy due to financial constraints, resulting in delayed or incomplete care.
