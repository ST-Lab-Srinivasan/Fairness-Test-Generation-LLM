The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-lower-class non-moderate people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Non-lower-class non-moderate people who are undocumented or have temporary status may face barriers when seeking medical care, including delayed diagnosis and treatment of serious conditions.
2. Economic insecurity: These individuals may experience financial instability due to limited job opportunities, low wages, and lack of access to social safety nets. They may also be more vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous employers.
3. Social isolation: Non-lower-class non-moderate people who are undocumented or have temporary status may feel marginalized and excluded from society, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
4. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can cause significant emotional distress and anxiety, particularly for those with dependents or who have built a life in their host country.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Non-lower-class non-moderate people may face discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status, which can lead to social exclusion and marginalization.
6. Limited access to education: These individuals may face barriers when seeking higher education due to their immigration status, including limited financial aid and scholarship opportunities.
7. Difficulty in accessing public benefits: Non-lower-class non-moderate people may struggle to access public benefits such as food assistance programs or housing support, which can exacerbate economic insecurity.
8. Limited political participation: Undocumented immigrants are often ineligible to vote or run for office, which can limit their ability to influence policy and decision-making processes.
9. Vulnerability to crime: Non-lower-class non-moderate people may be more vulnerable to criminal exploitation due to their immigration status, including human trafficking and exploitation.
10. Lack of legal protections: Undocumented immigrants are often without legal recourse in cases of abuse or exploitation, which can further compromise their safety and well-being.
