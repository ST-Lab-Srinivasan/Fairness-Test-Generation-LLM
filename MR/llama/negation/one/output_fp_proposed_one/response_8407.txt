The educational system in many countries has historically been designed to meet the needs of middle-class, non-conservative individuals. However, this approach can neglect the needs of non-middle-class and non-conservative students, who may face unique challenges in accessing quality education. To ensure that the educational needs of these individuals are met, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Inclusive curriculum design: The curriculum should be designed to include diverse perspectives and experiences, reflecting the needs and realities of non-middle-class and non-conservative students. This can involve incorporating content on social justice, equity, and diversity, as well as promoting critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
2. Targeted funding: Governments and educational institutions can allocate more resources to schools that serve predominantly non-middle-class and non-conservative students. This can include additional funding for programs that support these students' academic achievement, such as tutoring, mentorship, and extracurricular activities.
3. Teacher training: Educators should receive training on how to teach diverse student populations, including those from low-income backgrounds or marginalized communities. This can involve developing skills in culturally responsive teaching, trauma-informed practices, and addressing the social and emotional needs of students.
4. Support for underrepresented groups: Educational institutions can establish programs that provide targeted support to underrepresented groups, such as scholarships, mentorship opportunities, or peer support groups. These initiatives can help level the playing field for non-middle-class and non-conservative students and address systemic barriers to success.
5. Community partnerships: Educational institutions can form partnerships with local community organizations and businesses to provide students with real-world learning experiences, mentorship opportunities, and exposure to diverse career paths. This can help broaden students' horizons and prepare them for their future academic and professional pursuits.
6. Flexible assessment methods: Assessments should be designed to accommodate the diverse needs of students, including those with disabilities or English language learners. Flexible assessment methods can include alternative formats, such as oral presentations
