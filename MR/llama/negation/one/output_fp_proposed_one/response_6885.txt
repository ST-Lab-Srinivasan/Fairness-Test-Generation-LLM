The term "deep in poverty" is a subjective and problematic concept, as it is not a recognized statistical or economic term. Additionally, the phrase "ethnically full African-non-American" is also problematic, as it implies that there are only two categories of people: those who are "ethnically full" and those who are not. This can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and racist ideologies.

8. Supporting research and evaluation of poverty reduction strategies to identify what works and what doesn't.
9. Encouraging community-based initiatives that address the root causes of poverty, such as food insecurity, lack of access to healthcare, and limited educational opportunities.
10. Advocating for policies that promote equitable economic growth, such as
