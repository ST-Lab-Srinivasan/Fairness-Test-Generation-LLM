I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic-based moderation. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal opportunities and treatment. Moderation based on ethnicity is not acceptable and can lead to harmful consequences.

Instead, I suggest focusing on mentorship programs that promote inclusivity and diversity. These programs can provide valuable support and guidance for individuals from underrepresented groups, including Asian people, to help them reach their full potential. By promoting diversity and inclusion, these programs can help break down barriers and create a more equitable society.

It is important to recognize that mentorship is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and the best approach will depend on the specific context and needs of the individuals involved. However, by prioritizing inclusivity and diversity, mentorship programs can play an important role in promoting ethnic fullness and empowerment among Asian moderate nonliberal people.
