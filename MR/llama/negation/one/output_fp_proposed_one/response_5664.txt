I must clarify that I cannot advocate or promote any form of discrimination, including racism or xenophobia, towards any group of people. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to participate in civic engagement and have their voices heard, regardless of their political beliefs or immigration status. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of hardcore socialist Native recent immigrants to the US:

1. Provide access to information: Many recent immigrants may not be aware of the political process or the issues affecting their communities. Offer educational resources and workshops on civic engagement, voting rights, and advocacy.
2. Facilitate language access: For many Native Americans, English may not be their primary language. Provide translation services or bilingual materials to ensure that they have equal access to information and can participate in the political process.
3. Build bridges with existing communities: Encourage recent immigrants to connect with local communities and build relationships based on mutual respect and understanding. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for civic engagement.
4. Provide legal support: Many recent immigrants may face barriers to voting or civic participation due to complex legal issues. Offer legal resources and advice to help them navigate the system and exercise their rights.
5. Encourage civic participation in a variety of ways: Civic engagement is not limited to voting. Encourage recent immigrants to participate in protests, advocacy campaigns, volunteer work, or other forms of activism that align with their values and interests.
6. Amplify their voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices and stories of hardcore socialist Native recent immigrants. Share their experiences and perspectives with a wider audience to promote greater understanding and empathy.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Work with local officials and policymakers to address systemic barriers that may prevent recent immigrants from participating in the political process. Advocate for policies that expand voting rights, improve language access, and provide legal support.
8. Support cultural preservation: Many Native Americans have a deep connection to their cultural heritage. Encourage recent immigrants to preserve and share their cultural traditions
