Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that considers the needs and experiences of marginalized communities, including those who are transgender or gender non-conforming. Here are some strategies to create more inclusive social policies for not just above poverty line cisgender individuals:

1. Involve marginalized communities in policy-making: Ensure that marginalized communities are represented in the policy-making process through participatory mechanisms, such as community consultations, focus groups, and advisory boards. This will help ensure that policies address the specific needs and challenges faced by these communities.
2. Conduct gender analysis: Conduct a gender analysis of social policies to identify areas where they may be perpetuating inequality or discrimination based on gender. This can involve analyzing data on the impact of policies on different gender groups, including transgender and non-binary individuals.
3. Address intersectionality: Recognize that individuals have multiple identities (e.g., race, ethnicity, religion, disability) that intersect to create unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization. Policies should address these intersections to ensure that they are inclusive of all individuals.
4. Use gender-neutral language: Adopt language that is inclusive of all genders in social policies, such as using "person" instead of "man" or "woman." This can help avoid perpetuating gender stereotypes and reinforce the idea that all individuals are valued and respected.
5. Provide access to healthcare: Ensure that marginalized communities have access to quality, affirming healthcare services, including gender-affirming care for transgender and non-binary individuals. This can involve investing in healthcare infrastructure, providing training for healthcare providers, and addressing discrimination within the healthcare system.
6. Address education and employment disparities: Implement policies that address education and employment disparities faced by marginalized communities, including those related to access to quality education, job training programs, and anti-discrimination measures in the workplace.
7. Promote economic empowerment: Develop policies that promote economic empowerment for marginalized communities, such as microfinance programs, small business support, and targeted hiring
