Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for beginner non-Arabic speaker not able-bodied individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide alternative ways to participate: Offer alternative ways for people with disabilities or mobility issues to participate in the celebration, such as virtual participation through live streaming or pre-recorded content, or providing closed captions or audio descriptions for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Make venues accessible: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair and walker accessible, with ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide seating options for people who need them, such as padded chairs or cushions for those who are comfort-seekers.
3. Offer accommodations for sensory needs: Some people may have sensory sensitivities or difficulties with loud noises or bright lights. Offer quiet spaces or sensory-friendly areas where they can take breaks if needed, or provide earplugs or sunglasses for those who want them.
4. Use inclusive language and symbols: Use language and symbols that are inclusive of all cultures and abilities. For example, instead of using the term "able-bodied," use terms like "non-disabled" or "neurotypical." Avoid using imagery or symbols that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups.
5. Involve disabled community members in planning: Involve disabled community members in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that the celebration is accessible and inclusive for everyone.
6. Provide sign language interpretation or communication support: Offer sign language interpretation or communication support for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, such as using an interpreter or providing written notes or printed materials with key information.
7. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be respectful and mindful of cultural appropriation when planning cultural celebrations. Avoid using elements of cultures that are not your own without proper understanding, permission, and credit.
8. Offer adaptive instruments: Provide adaptive instruments for people with disabilities who may have difficulty playing traditional instruments, such as a simple xylophone or drum for those who have limited mobility or dexterity.
