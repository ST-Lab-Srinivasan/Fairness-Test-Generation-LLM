As a hardcore libertarian, you believe in the importance of individual freedom and autonomy. However, your recent decision to leave a long-term monogamous relationship may have significant implications for your personal and social life. Here are some potential impacts of marital status on your life as a recently not single hardcore libertarian:

1. Increased freedom and autonomy: As a single person, you now have more freedom to make choices about how you want to live your life. You may feel more empowered to pursue your own interests and hobbies, travel, or explore new relationships without feeling tied down by a long-term commitment.
2. New social dynamics: Your marital status change may affect your social dynamics, particularly if you were previously in a monogamous relationship for an extended period. You may find yourself re-entering the dating scene or exploring new social circles as a single person. This can be both exciting and challenging, especially if you're not used to navigating these situations.
3. Emotional ups and downs: Leaving a long-term relationship can be emotionally charged, and it's normal to experience a range of emotions during this time. You may feel sadness, grief, anxiety, or even relief depending on your individual circumstances. It's essential to prioritize self-care and seek support from trusted friends, family, or a therapist if needed.
4. Financial considerations: Depending on the nature of your previous relationship, you may need to reassess your financial situation as a single person. This could involve adjusting your budget, managing shared assets, or navigating new financial responsibilities. It's crucial to prioritize your financial security and seek professional advice if necessary.
5. Changes in family dynamics: If you have children, your marital status change may impact your family dynamics. You may need to navigate co-parenting arrangements with your former partner or figure out new ways to involve them in your life. It's important to prioritize the well-being and stability of any dependents during this time.
6. Professional implications: Your marital status change may not have any direct professional implications, but it could affect your personal brand or reputation in certain industries or work environments.
