Supporting the social inclusion of beginner non-Arabic speaker non-liberal people in Muslim-majority societies can be challenging, as these individuals may face discrimination and marginalization due to their lack of proficiency in Arabic and/or their non-conformity with traditional Islamic values. However, there are several ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language classes: Providing language classes specifically designed for beginner non-Arabic speakers can help them acquire the skills they need to communicate effectively in everyday situations. This can help build confidence and reduce feelings of isolation.
2. Cultural orientation programs: Offering cultural orientation programs that introduce non-Arabic speaking non-liberal individuals to the local customs, values, and beliefs can help them better understand the social norms and expectations of their new environment.
3. Social events: Organizing social events that bring together people from different backgrounds and perspectives can help create a sense of community and foster inclusive attitudes towards non-Arabic speakers.
4. Mentorship programs: Pairing non-Arabic speaking non-liberal individuals with more experienced and socially connected individuals can provide them with support, guidance, and opportunities for socialization.
5. Advocacy and awareness campaigns: Launching advocacy and awareness campaigns that promote the rights and dignity of non-Arabic speaking non-liberal individuals can help challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices, and create a more inclusive societal environment.
6. Online platforms: Creating online platforms or social media groups where non-Arabic speakers can connect with each other, share experiences, and access resources can provide them with a sense of belonging and support.
7. Community outreach programs: Implementing community outreach programs that engage non-Arabic speaking non-liberal individuals in local initiatives and activities can help build their sense of ownership and participation in the community.
8. Education and training: Providing educational and training opportunities that cater to the specific needs and interests of non-Arabic speakers can help them acquire new skills, knowledge, and perspectives that can enhance their social inclusion.
