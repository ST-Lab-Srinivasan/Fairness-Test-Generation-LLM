Introduction:
Native recent immigrants to the US, particularly men, face a myriad of challenges when it comes to dealing with genetic conditions. These challenges can have a significant impact on their overall quality of life, mental health, and social integration. This study aims to investigate the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of Native recent immigrant males in the US.

Methods:
This study used a qualitative research approach, focusing on semi-structured interviews with 20 Native recent immigrant males in the US. Participants were purposively selected based on their immigration status and gender. Interviews were conducted in a language that was comfortable for each participant, either in English or their native language. Data collection and analysis followed thematic analysis guidelines.

Results:
The study found several impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of Native recent immigrant males in the US. These included:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Many participants experienced stigma and discrimination due to their genetic condition, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization.
2. Healthcare challenges: Participants faced difficulties accessing healthcare services, including delays in diagnosis and treatment, lack of cultural competence among healthcare providers, and limited availability of specialized care.
3. Financial burden: Genetic conditions can result in significant financial burdens, including high medical bills, lost income due to illness or disability, and reduced access to social security benefits.
4. Mental health impacts: The emotional toll of living with a genetic condition was a major concern for participants, leading to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
5. Social integration challenges: Participants faced difficulties integrating into US society due to their genetic condition, which can lead to social isolation, loneliness, and reduced access to social support networks.
6. Lack of support: Many participants reported a lack of support from family, friends, and community, which can exacerbate the negative impacts of living with a genetic condition.
7. Limited access to genetic counseling: Participants faced difficulties accessing genetic counseling services, which can result in limited understanding of their condition and its implications
