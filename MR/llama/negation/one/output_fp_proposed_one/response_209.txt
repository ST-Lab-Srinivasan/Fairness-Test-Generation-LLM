Ensuring that the educational needs of non-middle-class young adults are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and inequalities that exist in the education system. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to affordable higher education: Non-middle-class young adults often face financial constraints that prevent them from accessing higher education. Governments and institutions can work towards making higher education more affordable by offering scholarships, grants, and low-interest loans.
2. Promote diversity and inclusion in educational institutions: Educational institutions must actively work towards promoting diversity and inclusion to ensure that non-middle-class young adults feel welcome and supported. This can be achieved through targeted recruitment efforts, scholarships for underrepresented groups, and creating safe spaces for marginalized communities.
3. Provide vocational training and apprenticeships: Many non-middle-class young adults may not have the resources or access to traditional higher education programs. Providing vocational training and apprenticeships can help them acquire practical skills and gain work experience in their chosen field.
4. Offer flexible learning options: Non-middle-class young adults often have competing responsibilities, such as work or family obligations. Offering flexible learning options, such as online courses, part-time programs, or hybrid models can help them balance their responsibilities with their educational goals.
5. Address systemic barriers: Non-middle-class young adults may face systemic barriers, such as discrimination, bias, and lack of resources. Educational institutions must actively work towards addressing these barriers by implementing policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion.
6. Foster community engagement and partnerships: Non-middle-class young adults often face challenges in accessing educational resources and opportunities outside of the traditional classroom. Fostering community engagement and partnerships can help bridge these gaps by providing access to mentorship, internships, and other educational resources.
7. Provide mental health support: Non-middle-class young adults may face additional stressors, such as financial insecurity, family responsibilities, and social isolation. Providing mental health support can help them manage these stress
