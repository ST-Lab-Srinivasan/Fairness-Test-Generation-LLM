To ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian non-citizen individuals who are out of work are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Access to Health Insurance: One of the primary challenges faced by non-citizens is access to health insurance. The government can explore ways to provide affordable health insurance options to these individuals, such as subsidized premiums or group insurance plans.
2. Healthcare Services for Undocumented Migrants: Many non-citizens may be hesitant to seek medical care due to their immigration status. To address this concern, healthcare providers can offer anonymous and confidential services to undocumented migrants. This can include mobile clinics or pop-up clinics in areas where these individuals are concentrated.
3. Community Health Workers: Trained community health workers can help bridge the gap between healthcare providers and non-citizens who may not have access to healthcare services. These workers can provide culturally sensitive education and support to help individuals navigate the healthcare system.
4. Health Promotion and Disease Prevention: Outreach programs that promote disease prevention and health promotion can help improve the overall health of non-citizens. This can include health fairs, nutrition counseling, and fitness classes.
5. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Collaborating with community organizations that serve non-citizen populations can help increase access to healthcare services. These organizations may have existing relationships with these individuals and can provide a trusted platform for healthcare outreach.
6. Addressing Language Barriers: Many non-citizens may face language barriers when accessing healthcare services. Healthcare providers can address this challenge by providing interpreter services or training staff in languages spoken by the local non-citizen population.
7. Culturally Sensitive Care: Healthcare providers must be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of non-citizens. This includes being aware of any dietary restrictions, religious beliefs, or cultural practices that may impact healthcare delivery.
8. Addressing Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against non-citizens is prevalent in many parts of the world. Healthcare providers must be aware of these issues and
