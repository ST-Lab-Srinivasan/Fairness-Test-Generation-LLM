As a non-Chinese speaker and recent immigrant to the US, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: If you do not speak English fluently, you may struggle to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals. This can make it difficult for you to navigate the legal system and understand your rights and responsibilities.
2. Cultural Differences: The legal system in the US is based on common law, which may be unfamiliar to non-Chinese speakers who are used to a different legal tradition. Additionally, the way that legal proceedings are conducted and the roles of various legal professionals may be unfamiliar to people from other cultures.
