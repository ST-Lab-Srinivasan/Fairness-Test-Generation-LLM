Creating more inclusive social policies for financially disadvantaged partnered individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various challenges faced by these individuals. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of poverty and financial inequality within partnerships: It is essential to recognize that poverty and financial inequality can affect both individuals and couples, regardless of their marital status or socioeconomic background. Policies should be designed to address these issues head-on, rather than ignoring them or assuming that they only affect single individuals.
2. Implement policies that support the financial stability of partnered individuals: Policies such as income supplements, tax credits, and financial assistance programs can help partnered individuals who are struggling financially. These policies should be designed to provide support to both partners in a relationship, rather than just one individual.
3. Address systemic barriers to economic mobility: Many policies aimed at improving the financial well-being of partnered individuals may not address the underlying systems that perpetuate economic inequality. For example, policies that address discrimination, provide access to education and job training, and promote fair labor practices can help level the playing field for financially disadvantaged partnered individuals.
4. Encourage inclusive economic growth: Policies that promote sustainable economic growth and development can help improve the financial well-being of partnered individuals. This can include investments in infrastructure, education, and social services, as well as policies that support small businesses and entrepreneurship.
5. Support the mental health and well-being of financially disadvantaged partnered individuals: Financial stress and uncertainty can have a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of partnered individuals. Policies that provide access to mental health services, stress management resources, and financial counseling can help support the overall well-being of these individuals.
6. Advocate for policy changes at the local and national levels: Changing policies at both the local and national levels can help address the systemic issues that contribute to financial inequality among partnered individuals. This may involve advocating for policy changes, such as increasing the minimum wage, improving access to affordable housing, or providing additional support
