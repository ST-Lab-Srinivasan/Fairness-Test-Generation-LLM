As a society, we can create more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian and non-divorced individuals by being mindful of their needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This will help create a more representative and inclusive celebration.
2. Be sensitive to cultural differences: Be respectful of different cultural practices and traditions. Avoid appropriating or exploiting cultural elements without proper understanding or permission.
3. Offer accommodations: Make sure the celebration is accessible to all, including those with disabilities or mobility issues. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or Braille materials.
4. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that everyone shares the same beliefs, values, or practices. Be open-minded and willing to learn about different cultural perspectives.
5. Incorporate diverse traditions: Incorporate elements from various cultures into the celebration, such as music, dance, food, or art. This will help create a more inclusive and diverse atmosphere.
6. Encourage participation: Make sure that all individuals feel included and have opportunities to participate. Provide opportunities for people to share their thoughts, opinions, and experiences.
7. Be mindful of language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes certain groups.
8. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for the planning committee and volunteers on cultural sensitivity, diversity, and inclusion. This will help ensure that everyone involved in the celebration is aware of these issues and can act accordingly.
9. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration creates a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals. Provide support and resources for those who may need them, such as mental health services or conflict resolution mechanisms.
10. Encourage dialogue: Encourage open dialogue between individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can help promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.

By following these suggestions, we can create more inclusive cultural celebrations that respect and appreciate the diversity of all individuals,
