As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that any legislative changes should prioritize the well-being and rights of all individuals, regardless of their linguistic or cultural background. That being said, here are some potential legislative changes that could benefit native Spanish speaker non-civilian communities:

1. Language Accessibility: Ensure that government services and documents are available in multiple languages, including Spanish, to facilitate accessibility for non-native speakers. This could include providing interpreters or translators for individuals who may not speak the dominant language of the region they reside in.
2. Cultural Preservation: Establish programs to preserve and promote indigenous cultures, including language, music, art, and traditional practices. This could involve funding initiatives that support cultural festivals, workshops, and educational resources.
3. Education Reform: Implement policies that address the underrepresentation of native Spanish speakers in education, such as providing bilingual education programs or hiring more diverse teachers to better represent the community.
4. Healthcare Accessibility: Ensure that healthcare services are available in multiple languages, including Spanish, to cater to the needs of non-native speakers. This could involve providing medical interpreters or translators for individuals who may not speak the dominant language of the region they reside in.
5. Economic Empowerment: Develop policies that promote economic development in native Spanish speaker communities, such as providing access to capital and resources, or creating jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities. This could involve establishing business incubators or funding programs specifically designed for underrepresented groups.
6. Criminal Justice Reform: Address the disproportionate representation of native Spanish speakers in the criminal justice system by implementing policies that promote fairness and equity, such as providing legal aid services or addressing language barriers in court proceedings.
7. Immigration Reform: Develop policies that address the complex issues surrounding immigration, including providing a clear pathway to citizenship for non-citizens who contribute positively to society. This could involve establishing more inclusive and fair immigration laws, as well as addressing the root causes of migration from native Spanish speaker countries.
8. Voting Rights: Ensure that all eligible voters have access to the polls
