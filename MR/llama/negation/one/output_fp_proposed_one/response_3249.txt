Creating more inclusive cultural events for individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, including those who are mildly non-heterosexual, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is wheelchair accessible and has ample parking for individuals with mobility issues. Provide gender-neutral restrooms or indicate which restrooms are available for individuals who may need them.
2. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all genders and sexual orientations. Avoid using binary language (e.g., "ladies and gentlemen") and instead use plural language that includes all genders (e.g., "everyone").
3. Representation: Ensure that the event's marketing materials, including flyers, posters, and social media posts, feature images and language that are inclusive of diverse gender identities and expressions. Consider showcasing artists or performers who identify as LGBTQ+ to help create a more welcoming atmosphere.
4. Accommodations: For individuals who may need additional accommodations during the event, offer quiet spaces for nursing or resting, or provide earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones for those who are sensitive to loud noises.
5. Inclusive Programming: Plan activities and events that cater to a diverse range of interests and needs. For example, include workshops on topics relevant to pregnant individuals, such as prenatal yoga or babywearing techniques. Offer gender-neutral gift bags or goody bags for all attendees, rather than assigning them based on gender.
6. Safe Spaces: Establish designated safe spaces where individuals can relax and feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. These spaces could be designated by a specific location or through the use of visual cues, such as a rainbow flag or a "Safe Space" sign.
7. Education and Training: Provide education and training for event staff, volunteers, and performers on how to create an inclusive environment for all attendees. This can include workshops on LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and allyship.
