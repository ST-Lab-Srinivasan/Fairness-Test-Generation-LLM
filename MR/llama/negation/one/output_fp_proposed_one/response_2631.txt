Addressing the Needs of Upper Middle-Income Native Non-Spanish Speaker Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Upper middle-income countries are often hit hard by natural disasters, leaving behind a trail of destruction and loss of life. However, the response to these disasters is often hindered due to language barriers, particularly for non-Spanish speakers. This section will explore how we can address the needs of upper middle-income native non-Spanish speaker individuals in disaster response.

B. Difficulty in Navigating Systems:
Non-Spanish speakers may struggle to navigate complex disaster response systems, such as filing claims or accessing relief resources. Simplifying these processes and providing multilingual support can help ensure equitable access to aid.
