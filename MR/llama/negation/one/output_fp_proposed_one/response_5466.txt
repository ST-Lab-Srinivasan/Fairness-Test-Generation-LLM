Supporting recently retired non-veteran communities can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to issues related to gender identity and expression. Here are some effective strategies that organizations and individuals can use to support this community:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness programs on the importance of respecting and recognizing non-binary identities. This can include training for employees, volunteers, and other stakeholders on how to create an inclusive environment for non-binary individuals.
2. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of non-binary identities. Avoid using gendered language or making assumptions about someone's gender identity. Instead, use gender-neutral language or ask people how they prefer to be referred to.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the organization's facilities and services are accessible to non-binary individuals. This can include providing gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, and other spaces where people can feel comfortable and safe.
4. Consultation and Involvement: Consult with non-binary individuals and organizations to ensure that their needs and concerns are taken into account when making decisions that affect them. This can include involving non-binary individuals in decision-making processes and seeking their input on issues related to gender identity and expression.
5. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that support non-binary identities. This can include advocating for legal recognition of non-binary genders, challenging discriminatory laws and practices, and promoting inclusive policies in areas such as education, employment, and healthcare.
6. Support Networks: Create support networks for non-binary individuals to connect with others who share similar experiences and challenges. This can include peer support groups, mentorship programs, and other initiatives that promote social connection and well-being.
7. Healthcare: Ensure that healthcare services are inclusive and respectful of non-binary identities. This can include providing gender-neutral language on medical forms, using gender-neutral pronouns when referring to patients, and avoiding assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
8. Community Engagement: Engage with non-binary communities through events, activities, and other initiatives that promote social connection and inclusion
