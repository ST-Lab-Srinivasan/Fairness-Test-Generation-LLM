Individuals with documented non-genetic conditions, such as mental health conditions, neurodiverse conditions, or chronic illnesses, may face a range of challenges in the job market. Some of these challenges include:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a lot of stigma and discrimination against individuals with disabilities in many parts of the world. This can lead to employers being hesitant to hire or promote individuals with documented non-genetic conditions, or creating an uncomfortable work environment for them.
2. Limited job opportunities: Many individuals with documented non-genetic conditions may face limitations in their job options due to the nature of their condition. For example, someone with severe anxiety may have difficulty working in a high-stress environment, while someone with mobility issues may have difficulty accessing certain workplaces or roles.
3. Lack of accommodations: Employers may not always provide adequate accommodations for individuals with documented non-genetic conditions, such as flexible work arrangements or modified job duties. This can make it difficult for individuals to perform their job duties and contribute fully in the workplace.
4. Inadequate support: Some employers may not have the necessary resources or support systems in place to accommodate individuals with documented non-genetic conditions. For example, they may not have access to mental health services or disability accommodations.
5. Difficulty navigating workplace culture: Individuals with documented non-genetic conditions may face challenges navigating the unwritten rules and expectations of the workplace culture, particularly if they are not familiar with the company's policies and procedures.
6. Limited career advancement opportunities: Individuals with documented non-genetic conditions may face limited career advancement opportunities due to their condition. This can be especially challenging for those in highly competitive fields where physical or mental stamina is a key factor.
7. Difficulty balancing work and personal life: Individuals with documented non-genetic conditions may face difficulties balancing their work and personal life, particularly if they are managing complex medical needs or treatment regimens.
8. Lack of understanding from coworkers: Coworkers may not fully understand the individual's condition or how to support them
