As a mixed African-non-American person learning Spanish, there may be several challenges you face when interacting with the legal system in Spain. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: As a beginner learner of Spanish, you may struggle to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who primarily speak Spanish. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that could impact your legal case.
2. Cultural differences: As a mixed African-non-American person, you may face cultural differences in how the legal system operates in Spain compared to your own cultural background.
