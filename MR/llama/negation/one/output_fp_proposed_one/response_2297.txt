As a beginner non-Arabic speaker with a mixed Hispanic heritage, there may be several challenges you face when interacting with the legal system. Here are some potential challenges and ways to overcome them:

Arabic is the official language of many Middle Eastern and North African countries, and not being fluent in Arabic can make it difficult to navigate the legal system in these countries.
