Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower middle-income non-English speaker people are met can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to improve access to care. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for healthcare providers to help them understand and address the unique needs of non-English speaking patients. This can include learning about different cultures, beliefs, and practices related to healthcare.
2. Language Access Services: Ensure that interpretation and translation services are available for non-English speakers. This can include on-site interpreters, telephone interpretation, or video remote interpretation.
3. Patient Navigators: Train patient navigators who are fluent in the patient's native language to help them navigate the healthcare system and access care.
4. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the importance of preventive care and the availability of healthcare services. This can include partnering with local organizations, holding community events, and distributing educational materials in multiple languages.
5. Electronic Health Records: Implement electronic health records (EHRs) that can accommodate multiple languages and cultural preferences. This can help ensure that patient information is accurately recorded and communicated to providers.
6. Telehealth Services: Offer telehealth services for non-English speakers who may face barriers to accessing in-person care. This can include video or phone consultations with healthcare providers.
7. Language-Appropriate Materials: Provide language-appropriate educational materials and resources for patients, including brochures, flyers, and website content.
8. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partner with community organizations that serve non-English speaking populations to provide culturally competent healthcare services.
9. Patient-Centered Care: Foster a patient-centered approach to care that takes into account the unique needs and preferences of each patient, regardless of their language proficiency.
10. Continuing Education for Healthcare Providers: Provide continuing education opportunities for healthcare providers to stay up-to-date on best practices in cultural competency and language access services.
