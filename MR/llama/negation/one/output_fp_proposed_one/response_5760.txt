Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-Chinese speakers, particularly those who have been away from their ancestral homeland for an extended period. The cultural practices, values, and beliefs of one's ancestors can shape one's sense of self and belonging, and can provide a connection to one's roots.

For individuals who are not widowed and have been away from their ancestral homeland for a long time, cultural heritage can serve as a source of comfort and familiarity in an unfamiliar environment. It can provide a sense of grounding and stability, especially during times of transition or change.

Moreover, cultural heritage can also play a role in shaping one's identity by providing a framework for understanding oneself and one's place in the world. It can offer a sense of belonging and connection to a larger community, and can provide a shared language and set of beliefs that can help individuals connect with others who share similar cultural backgrounds.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage can also be a source of conflict and tension, particularly when individuals from different cultural backgrounds interact. Differences in cultural practices and values can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can create barriers to building meaningful relationships.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-Chinese speaker individuals who have been away from their ancestral homeland for an extended period. It provides a connection to one's roots, offers a sense of belonging and comfort, and serves as a framework for understanding oneself and one's place in the world. However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage can also be a source of conflict and tension, and must be navigated with sensitivity and respect for different cultural practices and values.
