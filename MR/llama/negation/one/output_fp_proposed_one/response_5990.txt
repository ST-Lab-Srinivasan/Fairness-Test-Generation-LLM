As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must acknowledge that the concept of "non-binary non genetic condition" is not a widely recognized or accepted medical or scientific term. Non-binary individuals are those who do not identify as exclusively male or female, but rather as something in between, outside of, or beyond traditional binary gender categories.

However, I understand that you are asking for ways to support the leadership development of partially identifying as non-binary individuals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Ensure that the leadership development program creates a safe and inclusive space for non-binary individuals to participate and feel comfortable expressing themselves. This can involve using gender-neutral language, avoiding assumptions about someone's gender identity, and creating a culture of respect and acceptance.
2. Provide gender-inclusive resources: Offer resources that are inclusive of all genders, such as gender-neutral restrooms or break rooms, and provide options for individuals to identify their preferred pronouns.
3. Foster a supportive community: Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives, and create opportunities for them to connect with one another in a supportive and inclusive environment. This can help build a sense of belonging and mutual support among non-binary individuals.
4. Offer gender-inclusive training: Provide training that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by non-binary individuals, such as managing gender expectations or navigating gender-related issues in the workplace.
5. Celebrate diversity: Acknowledge and celebrate the diversity of gender identities within the program, and create opportunities for participants to share their experiences and perspectives with one another.
6. Provide mentorship opportunities: Pair non-binary individuals with mentors who understand and support their identity, and provide guidance on how to navigate leadership positions in a way that is authentic and comfortable for them.
7. Advocate for policies that support non-binary identities: Work with organizational leaders to create policies and practices that are inclusive of non-binary identities, such as providing gender-neutral options for job applications or creating gender-inclusive employee benefits.
8. Educate others on non-binary identities
