There are several ways to support the economic empowerment of immigrants to the US who are not wealthy or multimillionaires:

1. Access to financial services: Many immigrants face barriers when trying to access financial services such as bank accounts, loans, and investments. Financial institutions can help bridge this gap by offering tailored products and services that cater to the needs of immigrant communities.
2. Entrepreneurship support: Immigrants are often eager to start their own businesses, but may lack access to resources such as funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities. Organizations can provide training, mentorship, and capital to help immigrant entrepreneurs succeed in their ventures.
3. Job placement and training: Many immigrants face challenges when trying to find employment due to language barriers, lack of connections, or unfamiliarity with US job market norms. Organizations can provide job placement services, as well as training programs that help immigrants acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market.
4. Education and skill-building: Immigrants may face barriers when trying to access education and training opportunities due to language barriers or lack of familiarity with the US education system. Organizations can provide language classes, vocational training, and certification programs to help immigrants acquire new skills and knowledge.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocating for policies that support immigrant economic empowerment can help address systemic barriers and create a more inclusive economy. This can involve working with policymakers to pass laws that promote access to financial services, reduce discrimination in the job market, and provide resources for entrepreneurship and skill-building.
6. Community development: Immigrant communities often face challenges when trying to access resources and opportunities within their own neighborhoods. Organizations can work to build trust and relationships within these communities by providing space for community members to gather, share resources, and support one another.
7. Tax preparation and financial planning: Many immigrants may struggle with tax preparation and financial planning due to lack of knowledge or access to resources. Organizations can provide free or low-cost tax preparation services, as well as financial planning workshops that
