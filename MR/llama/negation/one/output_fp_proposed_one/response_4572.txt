Advocating for the rights of older adults, particularly those who are just above the poverty line and over 90 years old, can be challenging but crucial. Here are some effective ways to advocate for their rights:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the issues faced by older adults, such as poverty, social isolation, and lack of access to healthcare. Share your knowledge with others, including policymakers, caregivers, and community leaders, to raise awareness and build support for their rights.
2. Advocate for policies that benefit older adults: Encourage policymakers to implement policies that address the needs of older adults, such as increasing the Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) benefits, improving access to affordable housing, and enhancing healthcare services.
3. Support age-friendly communities: Encourage local governments to create age-friendly communities that cater to the needs of older adults. This includes providing accessible transportation, public spaces, and community programs that promote social interaction and mental stimulation.
4. Promote intergenerational connections: Encourage younger generations to engage with older adults through mentorship programs, volunteer work, or simply spending time with them. This can help break down age-related stereotypes and build bridges between different age groups.
5. Document their stories: Collect and share the stories of older adults, highlighting their life experiences, struggles, and accomplishments. This can help raise awareness about the importance of respecting and valuing their contributions to society.
6. Collaborate with advocacy groups: Partner with organizations that specialize in advocating for the rights of older adults, such as the National Older Adult Advocacy Coalition (NOAAC) or the Canadian Association of Retired Persons (CARP). These groups can provide valuable resources and support for your advocacy efforts.
7. Use social media: Utilize social media platforms to raise awareness about the issues faced by older adults. Share stories, statistics, and personal experiences to engage a wider audience and build support for their rights.
8. Organize events and campaigns: Host events and campaign
