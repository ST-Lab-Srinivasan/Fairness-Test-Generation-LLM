The impact of immigration status on the lives of long-term, non-widowed individuals during their third trimester of pregnancy can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care due to language or cultural differences, lack of knowledge about available services, or fear of deportation.
