1. Increased Innovation: Non-independent active-duty individuals, particularly those from underrepresented groups, can bring fresh and unique ideas to the table. Their diverse experiences and viewpoints can stimulate creativity and lead to more innovative solutions.
2. Enhanced Collaboration: When leaders with different backgrounds and perspectives work together, they can foster a more collaborative environment. This can result in better communication, problem-solving, and decision-making processes.

Non-independent active-duty individuals can bring their unique perspectives and experiences to the table, allowing the organization to pivot quickly in response to shifting market trends or other factors.
7. Increased Employee Engagement: When leaders reflect the diversity of the workforce, employees are more likely to feel engaged, motivated, and valued. This can lead to higher job satisfaction, reduced turnover rates, and improved overall performance.
