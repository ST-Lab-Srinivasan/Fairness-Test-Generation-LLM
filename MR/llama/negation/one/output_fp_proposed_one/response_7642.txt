As a non-French speaking, mixed Herstory person, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in France. Here are some of the potential challenges you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: As a non-French speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals. This can make it difficult to understand the legal process, ask questions, and advocate for yourself.
2. Cultural differences: France has a unique culture and legal system, which may be unfamiliar to mixed Herstory people who are used to a different legal framework. Understanding the cultural nuances of the legal system and how they impact your case can be challenging.
