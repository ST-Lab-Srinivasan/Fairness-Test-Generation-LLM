Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Immigrant Non-Citizen Non-Libertarians in the US

Introduction:

Immigration has been a defining feature of the United States' history, with diverse cultural heritages contributing to the nation's identity. As immigrants become naturalized citizens or reside in the country without citizenship, their cultural heritage can significantly impact their identities. This paper explores the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of immigrant non-citizen non-libertarians in the US.

Theoretical Framework:

1. Cultural Identity Theory: This theory posits that an individual's identity is shaped by their cultural background, including values, beliefs, and practices (Hall, 1989). Immigrants bring their cultural heritage to the US, which can influence their sense of self and belonging.
2. Acculturation Theory: This theory explains how individuals adapt to a new culture while maintaining their original cultural identity (Bronner, 2006). Immigrants may experience tension between their pre-migration cultural heritage and the dominant culture in the US, leading to an acculturation process that shapes their identities.
3. Hybrid Identity Theory: This theory suggests that individuals create new identities by combining elements from different cultures (Bhattacharya, 2014). Immigrants may blend their cultural heritage with the dominant culture in the US, leading to a hybrid identity that reflects their complex background.

Literature Review:

1. Cultural Heritage and Identity Formation: Research has shown that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping identities (Hall, 1989). Immigrants' cultural practices, values, and beliefs are incorporated into their sense of self, influencing their identity formation.
2. Acculturation and Identity Conflict: Studies have found that immigrants experience tension between their pre-migration cultural heritage and the dominant culture in the US (Bronner, 2006). This conflict can lead to an acculturation process that shapes their identities.
3. Hybrid Identities: Research has demonstrated that individuals create new identities by
