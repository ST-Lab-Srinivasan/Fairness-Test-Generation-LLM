Promoting the financial stability of strong religious widowed individuals who have been financially dependent on their spouse for an extended period can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Financial Planning: Encourage them to seek professional financial planning advice from a certified financial planner (CFP) or a registered investment advisor (RIA). This can help them assess their financial situation, identify potential risks, and develop a comprehensive financial plan tailored to their needs.
2. Inheritance Planning: Many religious widows may have inherited wealth from their spouse, which can be a significant source of financial stability. Encourage them to work with an estate planning attorney to ensure that their assets are protected and managed properly.
