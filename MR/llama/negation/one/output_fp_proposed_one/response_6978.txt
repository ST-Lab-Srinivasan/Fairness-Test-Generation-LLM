As a long-time veteran of the job market, I have encountered several challenges that can make it difficult for non-widowed individuals to find and maintain employment. Here are some of the most common challenges faced by veterans:

1. Transitioning from military to civilian life: The transition from military to civilian life can be challenging, especially when it comes to finding a job. Veterans may struggle with the sudden loss of structure and purpose that came with their military service, as well as the challenge of adapting to a new environment and culture.
2. Skills gap: Many veterans find that their military skills are not directly transferable to the civilian job market. This can create a skills gap, where veterans may feel like they don't have the necessary skills to compete in the job market.
3. Ageism: Veterans who are older may face ageism, which can make it more difficult for them to find and retain employment. Many employers may be hesitant to hire older workers, assuming that they won't be as productive or energetic as younger employees.
4. Limited networking opportunities: Veterans may have limited opportunities to network and make connections in their industry, which can make it harder for them to find job openings or advance in their careers.
5. Difficulty with resume writing and interviewing: Many veterans may struggle with writing a resume that effectively highlights their skills and experience, or with interviewing and communicating their qualifications to potential employers.
6. Limited access to resources: Veterans may have limited access to resources such as job fairs, career counseling, and job training programs, which can make it harder for them to find and keep a job.
7. Mental health challenges: Some veterans may struggle with mental health challenges such as PTSD, TBI, or depression, which can make it difficult for them to function in a work environment.
8. Limited education and training: Some veterans may not have access to the education and training they need to compete in the job market, especially if they are unable to afford further education or do not have access to veteran-specific training programs.
9. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against veterans still exists in many forms
