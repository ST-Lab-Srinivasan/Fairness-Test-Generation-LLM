Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of widowed non-Arabic speaking individuals who have lived in a foreign country for an extended period. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For widows who have spent a significant part of their lives in a foreign country, their cultural heritage can help them connect with their roots and feel a sense of belonging to their original culture.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage shapes an individual's identity by providing a framework for understanding themselves and their place in the world. For widows who have lost their spouses, their cultural heritage can help them form their identities and find meaning in their lives.
