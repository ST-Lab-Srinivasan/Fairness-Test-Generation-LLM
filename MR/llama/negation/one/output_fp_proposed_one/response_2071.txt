Creating more inclusive community events for non-civilian long-term unemployed people requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Identify the needs of the target audience: Before planning any event, it's essential to understand the needs and concerns of the non-civilian long-term unemployed population. Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather feedback and insights on what types of events they would find most helpful and enjoyable.
