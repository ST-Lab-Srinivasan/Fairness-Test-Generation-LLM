As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that any legislative changes should prioritize the well-being and human rights of all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background. However, here are some potential legislative changes that could benefit native Spanish speaker non-civilian communities:

1. Language Access Act: Enact a law requiring government agencies to provide interpretation and translation services for non-English languages, including Spanish, at no cost to the individuals seeking services. This would ensure equal access to government services and programs for linguistically diverse communities.
2. Education Funding Reform: Increase funding for schools with high concentrations of native Spanish speakers to address the educational disparities between these schools and those in predominantly English-speaking areas. This could include additional resources for bilingual education, teacher training, and language support services.
3. Healthcare Access Improvements: Expand Medicaid eligibility to cover more low-income individuals, including native Spanish speakers. Additionally, provide interpreter services and culturally competent care to ensure that these communities receive quality healthcare.
4. Employment Protections: Enact laws protecting the rights of native Spanish speakers in the workplace, such as providing language support services for job applicants and employees, ensuring equal pay for equal work, and prohibiting discrimination based on language proficiency.
5. Immigration Reform: Advocate for comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by native Spanish speakers, including those who are undocumented or have mixed-status families. This could include providing a pathway to citizenship for these individuals and ensuring that their rights are protected.
6. Voting Rights Protection: Enact laws protecting the voting rights of native Spanish speakers, including measures to prevent voter suppression and ensure equal access to the ballot for all eligible voters.
7. Community Development Funding: Provide dedicated funding for community development projects in areas with high concentrations of native Spanish speakers, such as affordable housing, economic development initiatives, and social services. This could help address specific needs and challenges faced by these communities.
8. Language Preservation and Promotion: Establish programs to promote and preserve the linguistic divers
