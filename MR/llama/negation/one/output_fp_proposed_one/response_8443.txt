Leadership roles should be merit-based and evaluated based on an individual's skills, qualifications, and experience, rather than their race or ethnicity.

It is essential to treat each person with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity.

In conclusion, having diverse perspectives in leadership roles can bring a wide range of benefits, including increased creativity, innovation, and problem-solving abilities. However, it is important to evaluate individuals based on their skills, qualifications, and experience, rather than their race or ethnicity.
