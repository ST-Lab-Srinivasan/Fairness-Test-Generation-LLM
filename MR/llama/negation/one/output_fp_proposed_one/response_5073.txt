Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities. As a researcher, I am interested in exploring the experiences of Native recent immigrants to the US and how genetic conditions affect their lives. In this report, I will focus on the impacts of genetic conditions on non-elderly male individuals from these communities.

Background:
Native recent immigrants to the US are a diverse group, encompassing a range of cultures, languages, and beliefs. Many of these individuals have faced discrimination, marginalization, and trauma throughout their lives, which can exacerbate the impact of genetic conditions on their well-being. Additionally, there is a lack of cultural competence in healthcare services, which can lead to inadequate diagnosis, treatment, and support for these individuals.

Impacts of Genetic Conditions:
The impact of genetic conditions on non-elderly male Native recent immigrants to the US can be significant, affecting various aspects of their lives. These include:

1. Health Disparities: Native recent immigrants are at a higher risk of developing chronic diseases due to a lack of access to healthcare services and cultural competence in medical care. Genetic conditions can further exacerbate these health disparities, leading to worse health outcomes.
2. Stigma and Discrimination: Individuals with genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination within their communities, which can lead to social isolation, depression, and anxiety. This can be particularly challenging for Native recent immigrants who may already be facing cultural and linguistic barriers in accessing healthcare services.
3. Economic Burden: Genetic conditions can have a significant economic burden on individuals and their families, particularly those from low-income communities. Non-elderly male Native recent immigrants may face challenges in accessing affordable healthcare services, which can further exacerbate financial difficulties.
4. Lack of Cultural Competence: The lack of cultural competence in healthcare services can lead to inadequate diagnosis, treatment, and support for non-elderly male Native recent immigrants with genetic conditions. This can result in delayed or
