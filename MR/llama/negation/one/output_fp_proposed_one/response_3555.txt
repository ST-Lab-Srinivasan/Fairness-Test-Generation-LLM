As a non-independent beginner Chinese speaker, there can be several challenges faced in the legal system in China. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Language barrier: The legal language used in China is mainly Mandarin, which can make it difficult for non-native speakers to understand and navigate the legal system. Even simple tasks like filling out legal forms or attending court hearings can be challenging due to the language barrier.
2. Cultural differences: China has a different cultural background and legal tradition than many Western countries. As a result, non-independent beginner Chinese speakers may struggle to understand the local customs, practices, and expectations of the legal system.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Non-independent beginner Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or translation services. This can make it difficult for them to find the information they need to navigate the legal system effectively.
4. Difficulty navigating court procedures: The legal system in China has complex procedures and rules that can be challenging for non-independent beginner Chinese speakers to navigate. For example, understanding the different types of courts, their jurisdictions, and how to file a case can be difficult without a good understanding of the language and culture.
5. Limited access to justice: Non-independent beginner Chinese speakers may face barriers to accessing justice due to language and cultural differences. For example, they may have difficulty understanding the legal concepts or procedures, or they may feel uncomfortable seeking help from lawyers or other legal professionals.
6. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-independent beginner Chinese speakers may face discrimination in the legal system due to their language proficiency. They may be seen as less competent or capable than native Chinese speakers, which can limit their access to justice.
7. Limited understanding of legal rights: Non-independent beginner Chinese speakers may have a limited understanding of their legal rights and responsibilities, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively. For example, they may not know how to file a complaint or how to access legal aid services.
