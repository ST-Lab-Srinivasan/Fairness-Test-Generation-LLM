As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that an individual's identity is complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to any single factor, including cultural heritage. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, but it is not the only factor that determines an individual's sense of self.

Individuals who identify as ethnically full non-Caucasian and are also strong atheists may have a unique set of experiences and perspectives that shape their identity. They may have grown up in communities where they were exposed to diverse cultural practices, beliefs, and values, which can influence their worldview and sense of self. At the same time, they may also have experienced discrimination, marginalization, or oppression based on their race, ethnicity, or religious beliefs, which can shape their identity in complex ways.

It is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not fixed or static, but rather dynamic and constantly evolving. Individuals may choose to reject or challenge aspects of their cultural heritage that they feel are oppressive or limiting, while still embracing other aspects that bring them a sense of identity and belonging.

Ultimately, an individual's identity is shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including their cultural heritage, personal experiences, beliefs, values, and social and political context. It is important to respect and acknowledge the diversity of individuals' identities and experiences, and to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on race, ethnicity, religion, or any other aspect of a person's identity.
