Introduction:
Nigeria is a diverse country with over 250 ethnic groups, and French is not widely spoken or used as an official language. Therefore, native non-French speaker Nigerians may face challenges when accessing healthcare services, particularly if they are living in areas where French is the primary language spoken. This essay will explore some of the challenges faced by native non-French speaker Nigerians in the healthcare system, including communication barriers, cultural differences, and language barriers.

Communication Barriers:
One of the most significant challenges faced by native non-French speaker Nigerians is the language barrier. Many healthcare providers in Nigeria speak French as their primary language, which can make it difficult for non-French speaker patients to communicate effectively. This can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of medical instructions, which can result in adverse events or delayed diagnosis. For instance, a study conducted in the Niger Delta region found that many healthcare providers were not proficient in local languages, which led to communication difficulties and delays in diagnosis and treatment (1).

Cultural Differences:
Another challenge faced by native non-French speaker Nigerians is cultural differences. In Nigeria, there are over 250 ethnic groups, each with their unique cultural practices and beliefs. Healthcare providers may not be familiar with these cultural practices, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of patients' needs and preferences. For example, some cultures may have specific beliefs about the role of traditional healers in healthcare, which can conflict with Western medical practices (2).
