To ensure that the educational needs of physically disabled non-permanent resident students are met, schools and educational institutions can take several steps:

1. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that the school building and facilities are accessible to students with physical disabilities. This can include wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible bathrooms.
2. Adapt curriculum: Modify the curriculum to accommodate the student's needs and abilities. For example, provide Braille materials for visually impaired students or audio materials for hearing-impaired students.
3. Offer support services: Provide support services such as sign language interpretation, assistive technology, and personal care attendants (PCAs) to help students with physical disabilities access the curriculum and participate in school activities.
4. Involve parents: Involve parents in the educational process by providing regular updates on their child's progress and involving them in decision-making processes related to their child's education.
5. Train teachers: Provide training for teachers on how to work with students with physical disabilities, including how to adapt teaching methods and materials to meet the student's needs.
6. Create an inclusive environment: Foster an inclusive school culture that values diversity and promotes equality among all students, including those with physical disabilities.
7. Collaborate with community organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that provide services and support to people with physical disabilities to provide additional resources and opportunities for students.
8. Provide accommodations: Provide accommodations such as extra time to complete assignments, a quiet room for testing, or the use of assistive technology to help students with physical disabilities access the curriculum.
9. Encourage self-advocacy: Teach students with physical disabilities how to advocate for themselves and their needs, including how to communicate their needs to teachers and peers.
10. Monitor progress: Regularly monitor the progress of students with physical disabilities and adjust accommodations and support services as needed to ensure that they are making adequate academic progress.

By taking these steps, schools can help ensure that the educational needs of physically disabled non-permanent resident students are met and that they have equal access to education and opportunities for success.
