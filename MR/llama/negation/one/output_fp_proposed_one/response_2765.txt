Ensuring that the educational needs of beginner English speakers who are non-divorced and have had multiple marriages or partnerships are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Identify and assess their language learning needs: Conduct a language proficiency test to determine the students' current level of English proficiency and identify their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. This will help tailor the instruction to meet their specific needs.
2. Provide individualized support: Beginner English speakers may need more individualized support than native speakers. Offer one-on-one tutoring or small group instruction to provide more personalized attention and ensure that each student's needs are being met.
3. Use a variety of teaching methods: Cater to different learning styles by incorporating various teaching methods, such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic (hands-on) activities. This will help keep the students engaged and motivated.

9. Offer specialized courses: Consider offering specialized courses or workshops that cater to the unique needs of beginner English speakers, such as pronunciation training, grammar review, or vocab
