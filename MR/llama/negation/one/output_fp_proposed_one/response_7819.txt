This can involve incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum, as well as providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives in the classroom.

Train educators to recognize the signs of trauma and provide supportive, inclusive learning environments that promote healing and resilience.

This can help students connect their classroom learning to real-life experiences and develop a sense of belonging and identity.
