Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty beginner non-French speaker people can be achieved by considering the following strategies:

1. Provide translation services: Offer translation services during events to help attendees who may not speak French communicate with each other and with event organizers. This can include providing interpretation services, such as headsets with interpreters, or using visual aids like written translations.
2. Use simple language: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be difficult for non-French speaker attendees to understand. Instead, use simple and clear language that can be easily grasped by everyone.
3. Offer English language support: Provide support for non-French speakers by offering translation services, providing an English-speaking staff or volunteer team, or using visual aids like pictures or videos with English subtitles.
4. Make announcements in multiple languages: Announce events and activities in different languages to cater to the diverse attendees. This can include posting signs with event information in multiple languages or making announcements through a PA system with different language options.
5. Offer cultural orientation: Provide cultural orientation sessions for non-French speaker attendees to help them understand the local culture and customs. This can include information on communication styles, social norms, and event etiquette.
6. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids like pictures, videos, or props to help convey information and make events more accessible for non-French speaker attendees.
7. Create an inclusive environment: Encourage attendees to ask questions and participate in discussions by creating a comfortable and inclusive environment. This can be achieved by promoting diversity, respecting cultural differences, and creating a welcoming atmosphere for everyone.
8. Provide accessibility accommodations: Offer accessibility accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for attendees with disabilities.
9. Engage diverse volunteers: Recruit diverse volunteers who can help bridge the communication gap between non-French speaker attendees and event organizers. This can include volunteers who speak different languages or have experience working with diverse communities.
10. Conduct needs assessments
