Ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-high-income professional people in Nigeria are met is crucial for promoting equity and improving overall public health. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to primary healthcare services: Non-high-income professional people often face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of healthcare facilities in their areas. Governments and NGOs can work together to establish more primary healthcare centers in underserved communities, particularly in rural areas. These centers should be staffed with trained healthcare professionals and equipped with essential medical supplies.
2. Implement community-based healthcare programs: Community-based healthcare programs can help reach out to non-high-income professional people who may not have access to healthcare services. These programs can provide health education, screening services, and referral links to more comprehensive healthcare services. Community health workers or volunteers can be trained to provide basic medical care and link patients to nearby healthcare facilities.
3. Promote preventive healthcare: Non-high-income professional people may not prioritize their health due to financial constraints or lack of awareness about the importance of preventive healthcare. Governments and NGOs can launch public education campaigns to promote preventive healthcare practices such as regular check-ups, vaccination, and cancer screening.
4. Provide financial support for healthcare: Many non-high-income professional people struggle to pay for healthcare services due to financial constraints. Governments and NGOs can establish financial assistance programs to help low-income individuals access quality healthcare services. These programs can provide subsidies, discounts, or free services to eligible patients.
5. Improve health insurance coverage: Non-high-income professional people may not have access to health insurance due to financial constraints or lack of awareness about the benefits of health insurance. Governments and NGOs can work together to promote health insurance coverage, particularly in underserved communities. This can be achieved by offering affordable health insurance plans, providing financial assistance for premiums, or launching public education campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of health insurance.
