Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of physically able-bodied non-Mandarin individuals in various ways. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Married individuals may feel pressure to prioritize their spouse and family over other relationships, leading to social isolation for those who are not married or do not have a supportive partner.
2. Loss of identity: When someone's marital status changes, they may struggle to adjust to their new identity. For example, a divorced individual may feel like they have lost their sense of self after being in a long-term marriage.
3. Financial strain: Marriage can bring additional financial responsibilities, such as shared debt or joint bank accounts. This can be especially challenging for individuals who are not married and do not have a supportive partner to share these responsibilities with.
4. Lack of legal rights: In some jurisdictions, married individuals may have greater legal rights than those who are not married. For example, married individuals may have inheritance rights or decision-making authority in medical emergencies.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being single or unmarried in many cultures. This can lead to discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and social services.
6. Limited access to benefits: Some benefits, such as health insurance or parental leave, may only be available to married individuals. This can create challenges for those who are not married but need access to these benefits.
7. Lack of emotional support: Marriage provides a built-in support system, which can be particularly important during difficult times. Those who are not married may struggle to find similar levels of emotional support from other sources.
8. Different expectations: Societal expectations around marriage and family can create pressure on individuals to conform to certain roles or behaviors. This can be challenging for those who do not fit into these expectations, particularly if they are not married.
9. Limited social connections: Married individuals may have a built-in social network through their spouse and family, which can provide additional support and connection. Those who are not married may struggle to form and maintain social connections outside of work or other obligations.
