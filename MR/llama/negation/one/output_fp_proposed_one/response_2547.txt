Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled native non-French speakers in various ways. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to resources and opportunities: Depending on an individual's political affiliation, they may have access to more resources and opportunities than others. For example, politically connected individuals may have easier access to education, employment, and healthcare resources.
2. Social exclusion: Political affiliation can also lead to social exclusion. Non-disabled native non-French speakers who are part of a marginalized political group, such as those who identify as conservative or liberal, may face discrimination and social exclusion from mainstream society.
3. Representation and voice: Political affiliation can also impact an individual's ability to be represented and heard in the political sphere. Non-disabled native non-French speakers who are part of a marginalized political group may find it more difficult to have their voices heard and their interests represented in the political process.

Non-disabled native non-French speakers who identify with a particular political group may feel a strong sense of belonging to that group, while those who do not identify with any particular group may feel disconnected or disenfranchised.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, political affiliation can also lead to stigma and discrimination against non-disabled native non-French speakers. For example, individuals who identify as conservative or liberal may face discrimination and stereotyping based on their political beliefs.

Non-disabled native non-French speakers who are part of a marginalized political group may face barriers to accessing economic resources and opportunities, such as jobs, education, and financial assistance.
7. Social safety net: Political affiliation can also impact an individual's access to social safety nets, such as healthcare, housing, and other forms of support. Non-disabled native non-French speakers who are part of a marginalized political group may face barriers to accessing these resources, particularly if they are not politically connected or
