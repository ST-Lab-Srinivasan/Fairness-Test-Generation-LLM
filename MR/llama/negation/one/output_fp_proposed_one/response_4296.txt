Ensuring the healthcare needs of upper upper middle-income recent immigrants to Canada can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be employed to address this issue. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Language barriers: Many recent immigrants to Canada may face language barriers that can hinder their ability to access healthcare services. To address this, healthcare providers can provide interpretation and translation services, such as telephone interpreting or on-site interpreters, to ensure that patients can communicate effectively with healthcare professionals.
2. Cultural competence: Recent immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can affect their healthcare needs. Healthcare providers can improve their cultural competence by providing training on cultural sensitivity and diversity to their staff, which can help ensure that patients receive culturally appropriate care.
3. Access to primary care: Ensuring access to primary care is critical for recent immigrants who may face barriers in accessing specialist care.
