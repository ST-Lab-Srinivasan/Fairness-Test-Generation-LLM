Creating more inclusive community events for non-transgender people in the early stages of their transition can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that event organizers and planners can implement to make these events more welcoming and accessible. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" and "women") and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities, such as "everyone," "all genders," or "gender-diverse individuals."
2. Accessibility: Make sure that the event location is accessible to people with disabilities. This can include providing wheelchair access, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
3. Gender-Neutral Restrooms: Provide gender-neutral restrooms or offer private restroom options for those who may feel uncomfortable using a gendered restroom.
4. Education and Training: Offer education and training sessions for event staff and volunteers on how to create inclusive events, including how to use inclusive language and how to support individuals of all genders.
5. Safe Space Policy: Develop a safe space policy that outlines the expectations for respectful behavior and provides guidelines for addressing any incidents or disruptions that may occur during the event.
6. Partnership with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that support gender-diverse individuals to help promote the event and ensure that it is inclusive and welcoming to all genders.
7. Communication Strategies: Use clear and concise communication strategies to promote the event, including using language that is inclusive of all genders and avoiding language that may be alienating or offensive.
8. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that is inclusive of all genders, such as workshops on gender identity, sexuality, and inclusion.
9. Childcare and Family-Friendly Accommodations: Provide childcare and family-friendly accommodations to ensure that individuals with dependent care responsibilities can attend the event without worrying about finding appropriate care.
