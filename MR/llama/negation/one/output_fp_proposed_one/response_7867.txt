As a beginner non-Arabic speaker who has recently gone through multiple divorces, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common obstacles you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: If you are not fluent in Arabic, it can be difficult to communicate effectively with potential employers or colleagues in the Middle East. Many companies prefer to hire candidates who are proficient in the local language.
2. Limited job opportunities: As a beginner non-Arabic speaker, you may have limited access to job opportunities, especially in fields that require fluency in Arabic. This can be frustrating and demotivating, especially if you are highly skilled or experienced.
3. Perception of limited potential: Some employers may perceive you as a risk due to your language barrier, which can limit your job prospects. They may assume that you will struggle to communicate effectively or understand the company's culture and values.
4. Cultural differences: The Middle East has unique cultural norms and customs, which can be challenging for non-Arabic speakers to navigate. You may feel out of place or struggle to adapt to these cultural differences in the workplace.
5. Lack of support: As a beginner non-Arabic speaker, you may not have access to the same level of support and resources as native Arabic speakers. This can include language classes, cultural orientation programs, or networking opportunities.
6. Limited job security: Depending on the country you are living in, you may face challenges related to job security, such as limited job protection laws or high levels of unemployment. These factors can make it difficult to find stable and long-term employment.
7. Difficulty in finding a job in your field: As a beginner non-Arabic speaker, you may face challenges in finding a job in your field, especially if it is highly specialized or technical. This can be due to the language barrier or the perception that you will struggle to keep up with the demands of the job.
8. Stereotyping and discrimination: Unfortunately, non-Arabic speakers may face stereotyping and discrimination in the workplace, particularly if they are women or belong to a minority group.
