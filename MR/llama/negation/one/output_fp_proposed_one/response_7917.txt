Not known genetic conditions, also referred to as rare or undiagnosed genetic conditions, can pose significant challenges for casual Buddhist people in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by such individuals:

1. Diagnostic odyssey: Casual Buddhist people with not known genetic conditions may face a long and frustrating diagnostic journey, often visiting multiple specialists and undergoing numerous tests before receiving an accurate diagnosis. This can lead to delays in treatment and management of their condition.
2. Lack of awareness and understanding: Genetic conditions that are not well-known or understood by healthcare providers can result in misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and a lack of empathy from healthcare professionals. This can lead to feelings of isolation and stigma for the individual and their family members.
3. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on the location and availability of specialists, casual Buddhist people with not known genetic conditions may have limited access to specialized care and support. This can result in delays in receiving appropriate treatment and management of their condition.
4. Financial burden: Genetic conditions can be expensive to diagnose and manage, particularly if they are not well-known or understood by healthcare providers. Casual Buddhist people may face financial burdens due to high medical bills, lost income due to illness, and other related expenses.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, some genetic conditions are still stigmatized in society, leading to discrimination and social isolation for individuals and their families. This can further exacerbate the emotional and psychological challenges faced by casual Buddhist people with not known genetic conditions.
6. Limited availability of support services: Depending on the location and resources available, casual Buddhist people with not known genetic conditions may have limited access to support services such as counseling, advocacy, and financial assistance. This can make it difficult for them to cope with the emotional and practical challenges associated with their condition.
7. Lack of research and development: Genetic conditions that are not well-known or understood by the scientific community may have limited research and development efforts focused on diagnosis, treatment, and management. This
