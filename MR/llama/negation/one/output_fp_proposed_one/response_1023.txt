As a non-native Arabic speaker and Buddhist, I can attest to the challenges faced by individuals like me in the legal system. Here are some of the common obstacles:

1. Language barrier: As an Arabic speaker, I face difficulties in understanding legal terminology and procedures, especially when they are not translated into my native language. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and errors that can affect my rights and interests.
2. Limited access to legal resources: As a Buddhist living in a predominantly Muslim society, I may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, and other support systems. This can make it difficult for me to navigate the legal system and protect my rights.
3. Cultural differences: The legal system in many countries is based on Islamic law, which can be quite different from Buddhist beliefs and practices. This can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts when dealing with legal issues related to marriage, inheritance, and other areas that are sensitive from a cultural perspective.
4. Lack of representation: As a non-Arabic speaker, I may have difficulty finding lawyers or legal aid organizations that can represent me effectively in court. This can lead to unequal access to justice and increased vulnerability to exploitation.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still discrimination against non-Muslims in some countries, including Buddhists. This can manifest in various ways, such as unequal treatment under the law or restrictions on religious freedom. As a result, I may face additional challenges when dealing with legal issues related to my religion or beliefs.
6. Difficulty navigating Islamic law: In some countries, Islamic law (Shariah) is the basis for the legal system. As a Buddhist, I may not be familiar with these laws and procedures, which can make it difficult for me to navigate the legal system effectively.
7. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: In some countries, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation or arbitration are not well-established or recognized by the legal system. As a result, I may have limited options for resolving disputes outside of court.
8. Lack of knowledge about legal rights and protections: As a Buddhist living in a predominantly Muslim society,
