As a non-Mandarin progressive person, I can share my personal experience and observations on how cultural heritage plays a role in my life. While China has a rich and diverse cultural heritage, the dominant discourse and practices around cultural heritage often prioritize Mandarin language and culture over others. This can make it challenging for non-Mandarin speakers to fully engage with and appreciate their own cultural heritage.

Growing up in a Chinese-American community, I have experienced this firsthand. As a child, I was often encouraged to learn Mandarin and participate in traditional Chinese cultural activities, such as Chinese New Year celebrations and dragon dance performances. While these experiences were enjoyable and helped me connect with my heritage, I often felt like an outsider because I couldn't speak Mandarin fluently or fully understand the cultural references being made around me.

As a result, I have had to find alternative ways to engage with and express my cultural identity. For example, I have learned to appreciate and celebrate other aspects of Chinese culture, such as Cantonese music and food, which are more accessible to me as a non-Mandarin speaker. I have also sought out communities and spaces where I can connect with others who share my experiences and perspectives, such as Chinese-American cultural organizations or online forums.

However, it is important to recognize that the dominant discourse around cultural heritage in China often marginalizes or excludes non-Mandarin speakers, which can have negative consequences. For example, it can limit their access to cultural resources and opportunities, and reinforce power imbalances within Chinese society.

To address these issues, it is crucial to promote greater inclusivity and diversity in the way cultural heritage is defined and practiced. This can involve recognizing and valuing non-Mandarin languages and cultures, as well as challenging dominant narratives and practices that marginalize or exclude certain groups. By doing so, we can create a more equitable and inclusive understanding of cultural heritage that reflects the diversity and complexity of Chinese society.
