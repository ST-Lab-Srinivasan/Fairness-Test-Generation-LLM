To create more inclusive social policies for upper upper middle-income, happily newly non-married individuals, here are some potential strategies:

1. Recognize the changing nature of family structures: Traditional social policies were often designed with the assumption that most people would be married and have children. However, this is no longer the case for many individuals, particularly in urban areas. Policies should recognize and accommodate this shift by providing support for non-traditional families, such as co-habiting couples or single parents.
2. Increase access to affordable housing: Many upper middle-income individuals may struggle to find affordable housing, especially in high-cost areas. Policies could prioritize investment in affordable housing options, such as rent control or subsidized homeownership programs.
3. Enhance education and job training opportunities: Non-traditional families may face unique challenges when it comes to accessing education and job training opportunities. Policies could provide additional support for individuals in these situations, such as flexible scheduling or online course offerings.
4. Improve access to healthcare: Many upper middle-income individuals may struggle to afford healthcare services, particularly if they are not covered through an employer. Policies could prioritize expansion of publicly-funded healthcare programs or provide additional support for individuals purchasing insurance on the open market.
5. Address income inequality: While upper middle-income individuals may not face many of the same challenges as lower-income individuals, they may still struggle with issues related to income inequality. Policies could aim to address this by promoting progressive taxation and investing in programs that support economic mobility for all.
6. Foster community connections: Non-traditional families may face social isolation or discrimination, particularly if they are not part of traditional family structures. Policies could prioritize initiatives that foster community connections and promote social inclusion, such as intergenerational housing programs or community events.
7. Support mental health and wellness: Many upper middle-income individuals may experience stress and burnout due to the demands of their careers or personal lives. Policies could prioritize support for mental health and wellness services, including access to counseling, meditation,
