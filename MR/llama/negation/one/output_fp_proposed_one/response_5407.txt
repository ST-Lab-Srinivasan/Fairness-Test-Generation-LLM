4. Incorporate diverse representation in curriculum and materials: Use texts and resources that reflect the diversity of gender identities and experiences, and avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or binaries.
5. Train staff and faculty on LGBTQ+ issues: Provide training and education for staff and faculty on LGBTQ+ issues, including the needs and experiences of non-residentially bisexual students.
6. Create a safe space for all students: Foster an inclusive and respectful environment where all students feel safe and supported, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
7. Encourage student participation and leadership: Give non-binary and genderqueer students opportunities to participate in leadership roles and activities, and encourage them to take on leadership positions.
8. Develop a support network: Create a network of support for non-binary and genderqueer students, including peers, teachers, and mentors who can provide emotional support and guidance.
