9. Partnership building: Build partnerships with organizations that have a proven track record of providing effective disaster response services to marginalized or under-resourced communities.
10. Monitoring and evaluation: Continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the disaster response plan, making adjustments as needed to ensure that it is meeting the
