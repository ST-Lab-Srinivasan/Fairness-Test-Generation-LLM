Native non-Arabic speaker and native Chinese speaker people may face several challenges in the legal system, particularly when interacting with Arabic-speaking authorities or in predominantly Arabic-speaking countries. Here are some common challenges they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge is the language barrier.
