Promoting the financial stability of native-born Americans and recent immigrants after their spouse's death can be challenging, especially for those who are already vulnerable due to their immigration status. Here are some potential strategies that could help:

1. Financial Assistance Programs: Provide financial assistance programs specifically designed to help immigrant survivors of spouse death. This could include emergency funds, monthly stipends, or other forms of financial support.
2. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that immigrant survivors have access to affordable healthcare services, including mental health support. This can help them cope with the emotional impact of their loss and manage any medical needs.
3. Legal Support: Offer legal aid to help immigrant survivors navigate the complex US immigration system and ensure they are eligible for benefits such as Social Security Survivor Benefits or Veterans Administration Survivor Pension.
4. Financial Planning Workshops: Provide financial planning workshops specifically tailored to the needs of immigrant survivors. These workshops could cover topics such as budgeting, debt management, and investment strategies.
5. Community Support Networks: Establish community support networks that connect immigrant survivors with other individuals who have experienced similar losses. This can provide emotional support, language support, and practical assistance during a difficult time.
6. Access to Education and Training: Provide access to education and training programs that can help immigrant survivors develop new skills and improve their job prospects. This could include vocational training, English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, or degree programs in fields such as business, technology, or healthcare.
7. Microfinance Programs: Develop microfinance programs that provide small loans or other forms of financial support to immigrant survivors who may struggle to access traditional banking services due to their immigration status.
8. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels to better support immigrant survivors. This could include changes to immigration laws, social security policies, or tax laws that affect immigrants.
9. Collaboration with Community Organizations
