As a non-native French speaker and a native Arabic speaker, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by native non-French speaker native Arabic speakers in the legal system. Please note that these are general observations and may vary depending on individual experiences and contexts.

1. Language barriers: One of the significant challenges faced by native non-French speaker native Arabic speakers is the language barrier.
