Creating more inclusive cultural programs for culturally non-Hindu lower-class individuals requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen and engage: Start by listening to the perspectives and experiences of the individuals you aim to include. Engage with them in a respectful and empathetic manner, and be open to learning from their cultural practices and traditions.
2. Collaborate with community leaders: Work with local community leaders who are familiar with the cultural practices and traditions of the lower-class individuals you aim to reach. They can help identify appropriate cultural programs and activities that will resonate with this audience.
3. Use inclusive language: When designing cultural programs, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group.
4. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Provide options such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or Braille materials for individuals with disabilities.
5. Offer culturally sensitive activities: Develop cultural programs that are sensitive to the beliefs and practices of lower-class individuals. For example, if you are organizing a festival, consider including traditional foods, music, and activities that are meaningful to this audience.
6. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage dialogue and mutual understanding between different cultural groups. Organize events that bring people together and promote cross-cultural exchange, such as cultural festivals, workshops, or seminars.
7. Provide education and training: Offer educational resources and training programs to help lower-class individuals understand and appreciate their cultural heritage. This can involve teaching traditional music, dance, art, or language classes.
8. Create safe spaces: Establish safe and inclusive spaces for lower-class individuals to express themselves and share their cultural practices without fear of judgment or discrimination.
9. Build partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that serve lower-class communities to co-create cultural programs and activities. This can help build trust and rapport, and ensure that the programs are tailored to meet the needs of this audience.
10. Evaluate and improve:
