The military status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker non-independent individuals. These individuals may face various challenges and obstacles in their language learning journey, particularly if they are enlisted in the military or living in a military-dominated society. In this report, we will explore the impacts of military status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker non-independent individuals and identify potential solutions to mitigate these effects.
