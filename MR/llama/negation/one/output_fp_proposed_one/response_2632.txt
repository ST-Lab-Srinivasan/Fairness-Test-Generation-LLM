Addressing the needs of lower middle-income native non-French speaker individuals in disaster response requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some key considerations:

1. Language barriers: Provide interpreters or translators to facilitate communication between responders and affected communities, especially during critical moments like evacuation or search and rescue operations.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Engage with local leaders and community members to understand the cultural dynamics of the affected area and tailor response efforts accordingly. This can involve adapting messaging and delivery methods to better resonate with the target audience.

4. Inclusive decision-making: Involve native non-French speaker representatives in disaster response planning and decision-making processes to ensure their needs are addressed and their voices are heard.
5. Community engagement: Foster a sense of ownership and control among local communities by involving them in relief efforts, such as distributing resources or providing support during the recovery phase.
6. Training and education: Provide language training for responders to better communicate with affected communities and enhance their ability to understand cultural nuances. This can also involve educating local leaders on disaster response best practices.
7.

8. Flexibility: Be prepared to adapt response efforts based on the evolving needs of affected communities. This may involve adjusting distribution strategies or changing communication methods as needed.
9. Capacity building: Invest in capacity-building programs that empower local non-French speaker communities to better respond to disasters and improve their overall resilience. This can include training on emergency preparedness, first aid, and basic infrastructure development.
10. Advocacy: Raise awareness about the unique challenges faced by lower middle-income
