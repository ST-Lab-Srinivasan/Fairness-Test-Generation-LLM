1. Understand the needs of older adults: Conduct research or gather feedback from older adults in their 90s to understand their unique needs, interests, and challenges. This will help you design programs that cater to their physical, social, and emotional well-being.
2. Involve older adults in program planning: Engage older adults in the planning process to ensure that the programs are tailored to their preferences and needs. This can be done through focus groups, surveys, or consultations with local organizations serving older adults.

9. Provide cultural and spiritual activities: Incorporate activities that promote cultural and spiritual well-being, such as language classes, cultural events, or interfaith discussions.
10. Evaluate and improve programs: Regularly assess the effectiveness of community programs and make adjustments based
