Advocating for the rights of natural-born Canadian citizens who are not civil servants can be challenging, as these individuals may face discrimination or unequal treatment under the law. However, there have been several successful advocacy efforts throughout Canadian history that have helped to protect and promote the rights of these individuals. Here are some examples:
