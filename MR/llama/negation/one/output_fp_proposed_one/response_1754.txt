Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of mixed African-non-American individuals. Mentorship can provide these individuals with a sense of belonging, identity, and cultural understanding. Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Cultural identity exploration: Mixed race individuals may struggle to find their place within society, as they may not identify with any one culture or community solely. A mentor from the African-American community can help them explore their cultural identity and connect with their heritage.
2. Role modeling: Mentors can serve as role models for mixed race individuals, demonstrating how to navigate complex racial dynamics and advocate for themselves within different communities. They can provide guidance on how to assert one's identity and navigate challenges related to racism and discrimination.
3. Building confidence: Growing up in a society that often marginalizes or erases mixed race individuals can lead to feelings of insecurity and self-doubt. A mentor can help build confidence by providing affirmation and support, helping them develop a positive sense of self.
4. Network expansion: Mentors can introduce their mentees to other members of the African-American community, expanding their network and providing opportunities for socialization and connection.

This can help mixed race individuals better understand the social and political landscape they occupy and how to engage with it effectively.

7. Community involvement: A mentor can help their mentee become more involved in the African-American community by introducing them to community events, organizations, and initiatives. This can foster a sense of belonging and purpose, as well as provide opportunities for personal and professional growth.
