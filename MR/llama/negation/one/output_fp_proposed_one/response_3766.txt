Discrimination against non-Nigerian non-citizens can have significant and far-reaching impacts on their mental health. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Anxiety and stress: The constant fear of being targeted or treated unfairly due to one's race, ethnicity, or immigration status can lead to chronic anxiety and stress. Non-Nigerian non-citizens may feel uncertain about their future in Nigeria, which can cause significant emotional distress.
2. Depression: The weight of discrimination can lead to feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, and depression. Non-Nigerian non-citizens may struggle to find meaning or purpose in their lives due to the lack of opportunities and support.
3. Loss of identity: Discrimination can make non-Nigerian non-citizens feel like they don't belong in Nigeria, leading to a loss of identity and sense of self. This can result in feelings of disconnection from their culture, community, and heritage.
4. Trauma: Direct experiences of discrimination, such as verbal abuse or physical violence, can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other trauma-related mental health issues. Non-Nigerian non-citizens may struggle to cope with the emotional aftermath of these events.
5. Stigma and shame: Discrimination can lead to feelings of shame and stigma, which can further erode a person's self-esteem and sense of belonging. Non-Nigerian non-citizens may feel ashamed of their immigration status or ethnicity, leading to self-blame and low self-worth.
6. Difficulty in accessing mental health services: Due to language barriers, cultural differences, or fear of discrimination within the mental health system, non-Nigerian non-citizens may face significant challenges when seeking mental health support. This can exacerbate their mental health issues and reduce their access to appropriate care.
7. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social isolation, as non-Nigerian non-citizens may avoid social situations or feel uncomfortable in their community
