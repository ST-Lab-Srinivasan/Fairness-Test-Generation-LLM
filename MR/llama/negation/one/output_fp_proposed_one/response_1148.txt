Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner non-French speaker ethnically full African-Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make the program more welcoming and accessible:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency and diversity for all staff and volunteers involved in the program. This can help them understand and appreciate the unique experiences and perspectives of African-American participants.
2. Inclusive Programming: Develop programs that are inclusive of African-American culture and history. For example, you could include African-American artists, musicians, or historians in your programming.
3. Language Accessibility: Offer French language classes with instructors who are fluent in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). This can help make the program more accessible to participants who may not be proficient in standard French.
4. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and traditions of African-American participants. For example, if a participant observes a particular holiday or tradition, be respectful of their cultural identity and accommodate their needs when possible.
5. Representation Matters: Ensure that your program includes representation from diverse ethnic backgrounds, including African-Americans. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all participants.
6. Community Engagement: Engage with the local African-American community to develop and promote your program. This can help build trust and buy-in among potential participants.
7. Inclusive Marketing: Use marketing materials that are inclusive of African-American culture and history. Avoid using language or imagery that could be offensive or alienating.
8. Flexibility: Be flexible and accommodating when possible. For example, if a participant has a conflict with a program event, try to find a solution that works for them.
9. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from participants on how the program can be improved to be more inclusive. This can help identify areas where the program is falling short and provide opportunities for growth and development.
10. Collaboration: Collaborate with local organizations that serve African-American communities to develop and promote your program. This can help build partnerships and increase the visibility of your program
