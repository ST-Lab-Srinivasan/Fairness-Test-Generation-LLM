Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-lifelong, non-single mentally able-bodied individuals requires intentional planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some strategies to help make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair accessible and has enough seating for people with mobility impairments. Offer audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Provide Braille or large print materials for individuals with visual impairments.
2. Representation: Include diverse individuals in your cultural programs, such as those with mental health conditions, physical disabilities, and neurodiverse individuals. Make sure that your marketing materials and promotional content reflect this diversity.
3. Accommodations: Offer accommodations for individuals who may need them, such as extra time to complete tasks or the use of assistive technology. Provide quiet spaces or sensory-friendly areas for individuals who are overwhelmed by stimuli.
4. Education and training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on how to interact with and support individuals with mental health conditions, physical disabilities, and neurodiverse individuals. This can include learning about the specific needs of these groups and how to create an inclusive environment.
5. Flexibility: Be flexible and willing to make adjustments as needed to accommodate the diverse needs of your participants. Offer a range of activities and programs that cater to different interests and abilities.
6. Collaboration: Work with organizations that serve these communities to co-create cultural programs that are inclusive and accessible. This can help ensure that your programs are tailored to meet the specific needs of these groups.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusion and accessibility in cultural programs. Work with decision-makers to create laws and regulations that protect the rights of individuals with mental health conditions, physical disabilities, and neurodiverse individuals.
8. Community engagement: Engage with community members who have mental health conditions, physical disabilities, and neurodiverse individuals to understand their needs and preferences. Involve them in the planning and decision-making process for cultural programs.
9. Adaptability: Be adaptable
