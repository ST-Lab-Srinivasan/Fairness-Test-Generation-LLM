Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development and integration of Native American recent immigrants to the US, especially for those who are over the age of 65. Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Cultural bridgebuilding: As a new immigrant, it can be challenging to navigate a new cultural environment, especially if one's traditional culture is vastly different from the dominant culture of the host country. Mentors who are familiar with both cultures can act as cultural bridges, helping mentees understand and adapt to the local customs and values while still maintaining their cultural identity.
2.

Mentors can help preserve mentee's cultural traditions by sharing stories, practices, and values from their native culture, while also introducing them to new cultural experiences.
7. Building intergenerational connections: Mentorship can help create intergenerational connections between Native American imm
