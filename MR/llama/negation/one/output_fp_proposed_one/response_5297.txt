As a beginner Spanish speaker and non-Arabic speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in countries where Spanish is spoken. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge for non-native speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be complex and difficult to understand, especially if you are not fluent in Spanish. This can make it hard to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals.
