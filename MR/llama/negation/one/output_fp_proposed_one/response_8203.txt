The impact of military status on the lives of non-upper-middle-income individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited career opportunities: Military service can limit an individual's career options in the civilian world. Many employers view military experience as a liability, rather than an asset, which can make it difficult for veterans to find work in their chosen field.
2. Financial challenges: Transitioning back to civilian life can be financially challenging, especially for those who have accrued significant debt during their military service. Veterans may struggle to pay off loans, mortgages, and other financial obligations.
3. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: The transition from military to civilian life can be jarring and challenging. Veterans may find it hard to adjust to a new pace of life, with its different rhythms and expectations.
4. Mental health issues: Military service can take a toll on mental health, particularly for those who have experienced trauma or seen combat. Veterans may struggle with anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other mental health challenges.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, many veterans face stigma and discrimination in civilian life. This can manifest as lack of understanding or empathy from civilians, or even outright hostility towards veterans.
6. Difficulty building social connections: Military service can isolate individuals from their peers and make it difficult to form new relationships outside of the military. Veterans may struggle to connect with others in civilian life.
7. Limited access to healthcare: Veterans may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare, particularly if they live in areas with limited veteran-friendly medical providers. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care for chronic conditions or mental health issues.
8. Difficulty navigating the VA system: Navigating the complex and often frustrating bureaucracy of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) can be a significant challenge for veterans, particularly those who are not familiar with the system or have difficulty accessing benefits due to disabilities or other factors.
