As a language learning AI model, I can suggest several ways to support the educational aspirations of beginner non-Spanish speakers who are long-time married to someone who speaks Spanish:

1. Language classes: Enroll in a language class specifically designed for beginners, where you can learn the basics of Spanish and practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing.
2. Online resources: Utilize online resources such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to learn Spanish at your own pace. These platforms offer interactive lessons, quizzes, and exercises that can help you improve your language skills.
3. Language exchange programs: Find a language exchange program where you can practice speaking with a native Spanish speaker who is also learning your native language. This will provide an opportunity for both of you to improve your language skills while practicing communication.
4. Immersion: Surround yourself with the Spanish language by listening to Spanish music, watching Spanish movies or TV shows, and reading Spanish books or articles. This immersion can help you learn the language more naturally and gradually.
5. Consistency: Make language learning a consistent part of your routine. Set aside time each day to practice speaking, writing, or reading in Spanish. Consistency is key to making progress in language learning.
6. Practice active listening: When listening to native speakers, try to actively listen by paying attention to their pronunciation, intonation, and rhythm. Repeat what they say to improve your own pronunciation and comprehension.
7. Use flashcards: Create flashcards with new vocabulary words and phrases and review them regularly to help reinforce your learning.
8. Read in Spanish: Find simple texts or books that interest you, and read them in Spanish. This will help you improve your reading comprehension and vocabulary.
9. Speak with a native speaker: Practice speaking with a native Spanish speaker as often as possible. This can be through conversation exchanges, language meetups, or even just striking up a conversation with someone who speaks Spanish in your daily life.
10. Be patient and persistent: Learning a new language takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you make mistakes or struggle to understand certain concepts. Keep practicing, and you will see
