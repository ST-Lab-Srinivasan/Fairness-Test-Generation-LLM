Creating more inclusive social policies for employed but not non-widowed individuals requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the unique challenges and experiences of this demographic. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the value of experience: Employed but not non-widowed individuals have a wealth of experience and knowledge gained through their years of work. Policies should recognize the value of this experience and provide opportunities for older workers to share their expertise and mentor younger colleagues.
2. Address ageism: Ageism is a prevalent issue in many societies, and it can lead to discrimination against employed but not non-widowed individuals. Policies should actively address and prevent ageism in the workplace, ensuring that older workers are valued and respected.
3. Provide flexible work arrangements: Many employed but not non-widowed individuals may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities. Policies should offer flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, part-time work, or job sharing to help them manage these responsibilities more effectively.
4. Offer financial support: Employed but not non-widowed individuals may face financial challenges, particularly if they have been out of the workforce for an extended period. Policies should offer financial support such as retirement savings plans or financial assistance programs to help them get back on their feet.
5. Promote mental health support: The loss of a spouse can have a significant impact on mental health, and employed but not non-widowed individuals may need additional support. Policies should promote mental health support services, such as counseling or therapy, to help them cope with their grief.
6. Foster a sense of community: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for employed but not non-widowed individuals. Policies should foster a sense of community by promoting social events, volunteer opportunities, or other activities that bring people together.
7. Address access to healthcare: Employed but not non-widowed individuals may face challenges accessing healthcare, particularly if they have been out of the workforce for an extended period. Policies should ensure that these individuals have access to affordable and quality healthcare services.
