Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty Native American non-citizen students in the United States can be challenging due to various factors such as cultural and linguistic barriers, lack of access to resources, and discrimination. However, there are several steps that can be taken to address these issues and ensure that their educational needs are met:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Educators: Providing cultural competency training for educators can help them understand the unique needs and experiences of Native American students. This training can cover topics such as the history and culture of Native American tribes, the impact of colonization and forced assimilation on their communities, and the importance of cultural preservation.
2. Bilingual Education Programs: Developing bilingual education programs that incorporate the language and cultural practices of Native American students can help them feel more connected to their educational experience. This can involve providing translators or interpreters in the classroom, using native languages as a medium of instruction, and incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum.
3. Indigenous Curriculum Development: Developing curricula that are grounded in the experiences and perspectives of Native American communities can help students feel more invested in their education. This can involve incorporating indigenous teachings, stories, and cultural practices into the curriculum, as well as involving Native American community members in the development and implementation of educational programs.
4. Access to Resources: Ensuring that Native American students have access to resources such as computers, internet, and library materials can help them stay engaged in their education. This can also involve providing additional support services such as tutoring, mentoring, and academic advising.
5. Addressing Discrimination: Addressing discrimination and racism within educational institutions is crucial for ensuring that Native American students feel welcome and supported. This can involve implementing anti-bias training for educators, creating safe spaces for Native American students, and addressing incidents of discrimination and harassment.
6. Community Partnerships: Developing partnerships with Native American communities can help ensure that educational programs are culturally responsive and tailored to the needs of students. This can involve collaborating with tribal elders, community leaders, and cultural practitioners to develop programs that incorporate traditional knowledge and practices.
