Creating more inclusive community events for native non-Chinese speaker advanced older adults (ages 90 and above) requires careful consideration of their needs, preferences, and cultural backgrounds. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer multilingual support: Provide interpretation services in the languages spoken by the older adults, such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, or Korean. This can be done through live interpreters, video conferencing, or even voice-to-voice translation technology.
2. Use accessible communication channels: Ensure that all event materials, including invitations, programs, and announcements, are available in multiple formats, such as large print, braille, audio, or e-books. This will enable older adults with visual or cognitive impairments to participate more easily.
3. Adapt activities to abilities: Modify games, exercises, and other activities to accommodate the physical limitations and cognitive abilities of older adults. For example, use simple language and clear instructions, provide verbal cues instead of visual ones, or modify tasks to suit individual needs.
4. Foster intergenerational connections: Pair older adults with younger volunteers or participants who can help facilitate activities, provide support, and create opportunities for socialization. This can help bridge the generational gap and foster meaningful interactions.
5. Provide transportation options: Offer transportation services or arrange carpooling to ensure that older adults can easily attend events without worrying about transportation challenges.
6. Create a comfortable environment: Ensure that event spaces are well-ventilated, well-lit, and at a comfortable temperature for all participants. Provide comfortable seating and arrangement options to accommodate different preferences and needs.
7. Offer cultural programming: Incorporate traditional music, dance, art, or other cultural elements from the older adults' countries of origin into event activities. This can help create a sense of belonging and connection to their heritage.
8. Make technology accessible: Provide access to assistive technologies, such as magnification glasses, audio loop systems, or closed captioning, to help older adults with visual or hearing impairments participate more fully in events.
9. Encourage peer-to-peer interaction
