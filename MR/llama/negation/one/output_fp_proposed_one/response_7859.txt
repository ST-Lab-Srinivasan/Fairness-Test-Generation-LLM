1. Language barrier: For individuals who are not fluent in French, navigating the job market in France can be particularly challenging. Many job postings and company communications are in French, making it difficult for non-native speakers to apply or understand job opportunities.
2. Cultural differences: France has a unique culture and work environment that may differ significantly from other countries. Recently divorced individuals who are not familiar with these cultural norms may find it challenging to adapt and succeed in the French job market.

7. Legal and administrative hurdles: Non-native speakers may encounter legal and administrative obstacles when seeking employment in France. For instance, they may need to obtain a work permit or residence visa, which can be time-consuming and complex.
8. Stereotypes and biases: Unfortunately, there are still stereotypes and biases against non-native speakers in the French job market. These can manifest as assumptions that they are less qualified or less committed to their work, which can
