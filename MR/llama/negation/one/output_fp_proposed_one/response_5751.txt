Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly married non-Arabic speaker individuals, particularly those from diverse backgrounds. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular community or group. For example, a person who grows up speaking their parents' native language and participating in cultural traditions may feel more connected to their family and community than someone who does not share these experiences.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity by providing a framework for understanding themselves and their place in the world. For example, a person from a specific ethnic or racial group may identify with certain cultural practices or beliefs that are associated with their group.
3. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of an individual's identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, and class. For example, a newly married non-Arabic speaker individual who is also a woman of color may feel a sense of double consciousness between their cultural heritage and their other identities.
4. Nostalgia: Cultural heritage can evoke feelings of nostalgia, particularly when individuals are away from their homeland or community. For example, a person who grows up speaking their parents' native language may feel a strong attachment to this language and culture when they are away from home.
5. Resistance and activism: Cultural heritage can also be used as a means of resistance and activism, particularly in the face of oppression or marginalization. For example, a newly married non-Arabic speaker individual who is part of a marginalized community may use their cultural heritage to challenge dominant narratives and advocate for their rights.
6. Cultural appreciation: Finally, cultural heritage can be appreciated and valued for its own sake, regardless of an individual's personal identity. For example, a person who is not from the Middle East or North Africa may still appreciate the beauty and richness of Arabic culture and language, and may choose to learn it as a hobby or out of interest.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a complex role in shaping the identities of newly married non-Arabic speaker individuals. It can influence their sense of belonging, identity formation
