The impact of disability status on the lives of strong religious post-transition transgender people can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Transgender individuals may face social isolation, discrimination, and stigma from their families, communities, and religious institutions, which can exacerbate feelings of disability and marginalization.
2. Mental health challenges: The intersectional experience of being transgender and disabled can lead to higher rates of mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
3. Lack of accessibility: Disability status may limit access to religious spaces, rituals, and practices, further marginalizing transgender individuals and excluding them from full participation in their faith communities.
4. Internalized oppression: Transgender individuals may internalize the stigma and discrimination they face, leading to self-doubt, low self-esteem, and a lack of confidence in their religious identity.
5. Difficulty finding supportive communities: Due to the intersectional nature of disability and transgender status, it can be challenging for individuals to find supportive religious communities that acknowledge and affirm their identities.
6. Resistance to medical transition: Some religious communities may resist or denounce medical transition, leading to additional emotional distress and feelings of isolation for transgender individuals.
7. Difficulty navigating gendered religious roles: Transgender individuals may struggle to navigate traditional gender roles within their faith communities, leading to feelings of discomfort, exclusion, or even violence.
8. Invisibility in religious texts and teachings: The experiences and perspectives of transgender individuals are often invisible in religious texts and teachings, which can further marginalize and alienate them from their faith.
9. Limited representation in religious leadership: Transgender individuals are underrepresented in religious leadership positions, which perpetuates a lack of understanding and empathy within faith communities.
10. Difficulty finding inclusive spiritual practices: Transgender individuals may struggle to find spiritual practices that affirm their identities and provide a sense of connection with the divine.

It is essential to recognize these challenges and work towards creating more inclusive and supportive religious environments for
