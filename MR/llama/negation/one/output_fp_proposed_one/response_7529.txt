Addressing the needs of non-upper-class native non-English speaker individuals in disaster response requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide language interpretation and translation services, especially for individuals who may not speak English fluently. This can be done through mobile apps, telephone hotlines, or on-site interpreters.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of cultural differences and tailor disaster response strategies accordingly. For example, in some cultures, it is considered impolite to ask for help directly. Instead, offer assistance indirectly or provide information on how to access help.
3. Outreach Efforts: Engage with local community leaders, organizations, and social networks to reach out to non-upper-class native non-English speakers. This can help build trust and increase the likelihood of successful communication.
4. Accessible Communication Channels: Ensure that communication channels are accessible and easy to use for individuals with limited English proficiency or no English language skills. For example, provide written materials in multiple languages, use simple language, and provide visual aids.
5. Training for Disaster Response Personnel: Provide training on cultural competency, language accessibility, and communication strategies for disaster response personnel. This can help ensure that personnel are equipped to respond effectively to the needs of diverse communities.
6. Community-Led Response: Encourage community-led response efforts, where local individuals and organizations take a lead role in disaster response and recovery. This can help build trust and ensure that the response is tailored to the specific needs of the community.
7. Technology Solutions: Leverage technology solutions, such as mobile apps or messaging platforms, to reach out to non-upper-class native non-English speakers during disasters. These tools can provide critical information and resources in a language that is accessible and easy to understand.
8. Partnerships with Community Organizations: Establish partnerships with community organizations that serve non-upper-class native non-English speaker populations. These organizations can provide valuable insights into the needs of their communities and help facilitate communication and resource distribution.
9. Capacity Building: Invest in capacity building programs for local individuals and organizations to improve their disaster response and recovery
