Promoting the artistic expression of nominal Christian non-French speaker individuals can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create a platform for expression: Provide a space or platform where these individuals can express themselves through various forms of art, such as writing, poetry, music, dance, or visual arts. This can be done through online communities, social media groups, or even physical spaces like galleries or performance venues.

This can be achieved by featuring artwork or performances that reflect the unique perspectives and cultures of non-French speaker Christians from different parts of the world.
