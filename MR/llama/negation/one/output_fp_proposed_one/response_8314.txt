As a socially conscious AI language model, I appreciate your concern for promoting social inclusion and supporting individuals who may feel excluded from French language learning opportunities. Here are some suggestions on how to support the social inclusion of beginner non-French speaker people:

1. Offer free or low-cost language classes: Provide accessible and affordable language classes for those who cannot afford expensive courses. This can be done through partnerships with local community centers, libraries, or online platforms.
2. Create inclusive learning environments: Ensure that language classes are welcoming and inclusive for all learners, regardless of their background or level of proficiency. Encourage peer-to-peer learning and provide opportunities for beginners to practice speaking with more advanced speakers.
3. Foster a supportive community: Build a community of learners who can support and encourage each other. This can be done through online groups or in-person meetups, where learners can share their experiences and exchange language learning tips.

8. Provide personalized attention: Ensure that beginner learners receive personalized attention and feedback from teachers or mentors. This can help build confidence and improve learning outcomes.
9. Encourage self-directed learning: Provide learners with access to online resources and tools that allow them to take ownership of their language learning journey. This can include apps, podcasts, and
