Creating more inclusive cultural events for recently naturalized non-citizen fully asexual individuals requires understanding and acknowledging their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities, sexual orientations, and asexuality. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" and "women") and instead use plural language (e.g., "people," "individuals," or "community").
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural event includes representation of asexual individuals in leadership roles, performances, and artwork. This can help non-citizen asexual individuals feel seen and valued.
3. Accessibility: Make sure the event is accessible to all, including non-citizens with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, and wheelchair accessibility.
4. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that caters to the diverse needs and interests of asexual individuals. This can include workshops on asexuality, cultural events that celebrate asexual identities, and social activities that provide opportunities for connection and community building.
5. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for non-citizen asexual individuals to connect and express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by providing confidentiality guarantees, creating private spaces, and establishing clear boundaries and expectations.
6. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that educate attendees about asexuality and the experiences of non-citizen asexual individuals. This can help increase understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.
7. Collaboration with Asexual Organizations: Partner with organizations that cater to asexual individuals, such as the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) or the Asexuality Academy. These organizations can provide valuable insight and support in creating more inclusive cultural events.
