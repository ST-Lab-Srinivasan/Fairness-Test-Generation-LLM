Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native non-Spanish speaking ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that organizations and institutions can consider:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for staff and volunteers involved in the organization's cultural programs. This will help them understand and appreciate the unique needs and experiences of Asian communities, including language barriers, cultural norms, and historical trauma.
2. Community Engagement: Engage with local Asian communities to understand their cultural practices and traditions. This can involve conducting focus groups, surveys, or interviews with community members to gather feedback on what they would like to see in cultural programs.
3. Inclusive Programming: Develop cultural programs that are inclusive of all Asian cultures, including those from Southeast Asia, East Asia, and South Asia. Avoid tokenizing or stereotyping particular cultures, and instead strive to create programs that celebrate the diversity of Asian experiences.
4. Bilingual Services: Provide bilingual services, such as translated materials, interpretation services, and bilingual staff, to ensure that non-Spanish speaking Asian individuals have access to cultural programs.
5. Partnerships with Community Organizations: Collaborate with local Asian community organizations to co-create cultural programs that are responsive to the needs of the community. This can help build trust and legitimacy among community members.
6. Education and Awareness: Educate staff, volunteers, and community members about the experiences and challenges faced by Native non-Spanish speaking ethnically full Asian individuals. This can involve providing cultural sensitivity training, organizing workshops or events that highlight the contributions of Asian communities, and creating educational materials that address these issues.
7. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to all members of the community, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and braille materials for individuals with visual impairments.
8. Inclusive Fundraising: When fundraising for cultural programs, ensure that the messaging is inclusive and respectful of all Asian cultures. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or tokenizing particular cultures during fundraising campaign
