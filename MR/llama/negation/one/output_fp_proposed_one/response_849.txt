Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-mobile physically disabled individuals requires careful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility Audit: Conduct an accessibility audit of the event venue to identify any potential barriers or obstacles that may prevent non-mobile participants from fully participating. This could include assessing the wheelchair accessibility, seating arrangements, and availability of accessible bathrooms.
2. Modify Event Format: Consider modifying the event format to make it more inclusive. For example, instead of a traditional seated concert, consider hosting a standing-room only event with designated areas for wheelchair users or providing mobile chairs for those who need them.
3. Provide Assistive Technology: Offer assistive technology such as audio describers, sign language interpreters, and braille programs for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision.
4. Train Staff and Volunteers: Provide training for staff and volunteers on disability etiquette, accessibility, and how to assist non-mobile participants. This could include learning how to navigate wheelchairs, how to communicate with participants who are deaf or hard of hearing, and how to provide assistance without being intrusive.
5. Offer Pre-Event Activities: Offer pre-event activities that cater to the needs of non-mobile participants, such as a quiet room for those who need a break from the stimulation of the event, or providing sensory-friendly materials for participants with autism or other sensory processing disorders.
6. Partner with Disability Organizations: Collaborate with disability organizations and advocacy groups to promote the event and ensure that it is accessible to all. This could include partnering with organizations that provide services to people with mobility impairments, visual impairments, hearing impairments, or other disabilities.
7. Provide Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, Braille programs, and sign language interpreters for participants who require them.
8. Encourage Advocacy: Encourage advocacy from non-mobile participants by providing a platform for them to share their experiences and perspectives. This could include hosting a panel discussion or creating an advocacy group for non-mobile participants
