Genderqueer individuals who are not currently serving in the military may face a number of legal challenges, including:

1. Lack of recognition and protection: Unlike active duty service members, genderqueer non-active duty individuals may not have access to the same legal protections and benefits as their cisgender counterparts. This can include difficulties with things like employment discrimination, housing discrimination, and healthcare access.
2. Ineligibility for certain benefits: Some military benefits, such as access to base healthcare facilities or veterans' preference in hiring, may only be available to active duty service members. This can create difficulties for genderqueer non-active duty individuals who are not eligible for these benefits.
3. Difficulties with identity documentation: Genderqueer individuals may face challenges when it comes to obtaining identity documents, such as driver's licenses or passports, that accurately reflect their gender identity. This can lead to difficulties with things like travel and access to healthcare.
