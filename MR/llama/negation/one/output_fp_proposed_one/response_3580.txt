As a moderate liberal, beginner non-Chinese speaker person in the legal system, there are several challenges that you may face. Here are some of them:

1. Language barrier: As a non-Chinese speaker, you may struggle to understand and navigate the complexities of the Chinese legal system, which is largely based on written documents and formal language.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in China has its own unique cultural context, and as a foreigner, you may find it difficult to fully grasp the nuances of the culture and how they impact the legal process.
3. Lack of familiarity with local laws and regulations: As a beginner, you may not be familiar with the specific laws and regulations that govern the Chinese legal system, which can make it difficult to navigate the system effectively.
4. Limited access to legal resources: As a non-Chinese speaker, you may have limited access to legal resources such as law libraries, legal aid organizations, and other resources that are available to native speakers.
5. Discrimination or bias: Unfortunately, there is a history of discrimination against foreigners in the Chinese legal system, particularly against those who do not speak Chinese fluently. This can lead to difficulties in navigating the system and accessing legal resources.
6. Difficulty in finding a lawyer: As a non-Chinese speaker, you may find it challenging to find a lawyer who is fluent in your language and familiar with the legal system in China.
7. Limited understanding of local customs and practices: The Chinese legal system has its own unique customs and practices, which can be difficult for foreigners to understand and navigate.
8. Difficulty in proving a case: As a non-Chinese speaker, you may find it challenging to gather evidence and build a strong legal case, particularly if you are not familiar with the local laws and regulations.
9. Limited access to justice: Unfortunately, some foreigners in China have reported difficulty in accessing justice, particularly if they are not fluent in Chinese or do not have a good understanding of the local legal system.
10. Cultural differences in communication: Communication styles can vary greatly between cultures, and as a non-Chinese speaker, you may find it difficult to navigate the cultural differences in communication that exist within the legal system in China.
