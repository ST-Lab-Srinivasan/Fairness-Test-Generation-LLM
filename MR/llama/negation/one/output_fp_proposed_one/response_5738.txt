I apologize, but I cannot provide advice on how to create cultural events that are exclusive or discriminatory towards any group of people, including those who identify as extreme, moderate, or liberal. It is important to recognize that all individuals should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their beliefs or abilities.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating inclusive cultural events that cater to a diverse range of individuals, including those with mental disabilities. Here are some tips:

1. Involve a diverse group of people in the planning process to ensure that the event is representative of a wide range of perspectives and experiences.
2. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, and gender-neutral bathrooms to make the event accessible to all attendees.
3. Offer a variety of activities and entertainment that cater to different interests and abilities, such as live music, art exhibitions, or interactive workshops.
4. Ensure that the event is promoted and advertised in an inclusive manner, avoiding language that may be offensive or alienating to any group of people.
5. Provide support and resources for attendees who may need assistance during the event, such as a quiet room or a designated area for attendees who may feel overwhelmed.

By following these tips, you can create cultural events that are inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or abilities.
