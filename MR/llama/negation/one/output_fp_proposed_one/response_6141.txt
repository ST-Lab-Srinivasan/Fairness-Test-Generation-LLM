As a native Spanish speaker and a natural-born US non-citizen, there are several challenges that I have faced in the legal system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Language barriers: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. As a non-English speaker, I often struggle to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals.
