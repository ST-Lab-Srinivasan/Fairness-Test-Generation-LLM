As a beginner Chinese speaker with non-Hispanic heritage, there are several challenges you may face when interacting with the legal system in the United States. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The legal system can be complex and nuanced, and it can be difficult to understand without a strong grasp of the language used in courtrooms. As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may struggle to follow proceedings or communicate effectively with legal professionals.
