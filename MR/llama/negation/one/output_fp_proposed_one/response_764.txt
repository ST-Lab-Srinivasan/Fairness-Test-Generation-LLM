I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about a person's perspective or experiences based on their immigration status. Every individual has their own unique perspectives and experiences, regardless of their immigration status. It's important to treat each person with dignity and respect, and not make judgments or assumptions about them based on stereotypes or preconceived notions.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that wealth and immigration status are not mutually exclusive. There are many wealthy individuals who are also immigrants, and there are many individuals who are not wealthy who are also immigrants. It's important to avoid making assumptions about someone's background or experiences based on their immigration status.

In general, it's important to approach each person as an individual and to treat them with respect and dignity. It's also important to recognize that everyone has their own unique perspective and experiences, and to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's race, ethnicity, immigration status, or any other characteristic.
