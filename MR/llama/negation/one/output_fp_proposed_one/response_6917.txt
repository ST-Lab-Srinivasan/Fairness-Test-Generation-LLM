Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-Mandarin native, U.S.-born individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to help make cultural programs more accessible and inclusive:

1. Offer alternatives: Provide options for cultural programming that cater to diverse languages and cultures. For example, offer Mandarin language classes alongside other Asian languages or cultural programs in different languages.
