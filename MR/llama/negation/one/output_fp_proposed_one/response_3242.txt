The healthcare system in many countries faces significant challenges when it comes to serving native non-Arabic speaker children. Here are some of the common challenges faced by these children:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge is the language barrier, as many healthcare providers may not speak or understand the child's native language fluently. This can result in miscommunication and misunderstandings, which can lead to delayed or inappropriate treatment.
2. Cultural Differences: Non-Arabic speaker children may have different cultural practices and beliefs that can affect their healthcare needs. For example, some cultures may have specific dietary restrictions or beliefs about how illnesses are transmitted, which can impact the type of care provided.
3. Lack of Access to Care: Non-Arabic speaker children may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can exacerbate health problems.
4. Limited Health Literacy: Many non-Arabic speaker children may have limited health literacy skills, which can make it difficult for them to understand their medical condition, treatment options, and how to manage their health.
5. Difficulty in Advocating for Their Needs: Non-Arabic speaker children may face challenges in advocating for their own needs, particularly if they are not fluent in the dominant language of the healthcare system. This can result in them not receiving appropriate care or support.
6. Stigma and Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-Arabic speaker children may face stigma and discrimination within the healthcare system due to their cultural background or language barriers. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and decreased access to care.
7. Limited Availability of Cultural Competent Providers: There may be a limited availability of cultural competent healthcare providers who are trained to work with non-Arabic speaker children and their specific needs. This can result in a lack of appropriate care and support.
8. Difficulty in Communication: Non-Arabic speaker children may face difficulties in communicating their symptoms or concerns to healthcare providers, which can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.
