Creating more inclusive social policies for ex-spouse non-temporary workers requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the importance of care work: Ex-spouses who are not temporary workers often take on the majority of care work, such as childcare and household responsibilities.
