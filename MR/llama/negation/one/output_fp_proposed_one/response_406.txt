Ensuring the healthcare needs of non-active duty individuals aged over 90 years old (or over 85 years old) can be challenging due to various factors such as declining physical and cognitive abilities, chronic illnesses, and social isolation. Here are some strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Multidisciplinary care teams: Establish multidisciplinary care teams that include geriatricians, primary care physicians, nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, and other healthcare professionals who specialize in caring for older adults. These teams can provide comprehensive assessments, develop personalized care plans, and coordinate care across different settings.
2. Home-based care: Provide home-based care services to enable older adults to age gracefully in their own homes. This may include home healthcare services, telemedicine consultations, and home modification services to make the living space safer and more accessible.
3. Community-based care: Encourage community-based care by providing resources and support for older adults who prefer to live in their own communities. This can include meal delivery programs, transportation services, and socialization activities that help combat loneliness and isolation.
4. Long-term care insurance: Offer long-term care insurance options to help cover the costs of home-based or community-based care. These policies can provide financial support for older adults who require ongoing care and support.
5. Palliative care: Develop palliative care programs that focus on managing pain, symptoms, and psychological distress associated with chronic illnesses. These programs can help improve the quality of life for older adults who are nearing the end of their lives.
6. Caregiver support: Offer support services for family members and caregivers who are caring for older adults. This may include respite care, counseling, and education on how to provide effective care while maintaining their own well-being.
7. Telehealth services: Utilize telehealth services to remotely monitor and provide care to older adults living in remote or underserved areas. This can help reduce health disparities and improve access to care for those who may not have access
