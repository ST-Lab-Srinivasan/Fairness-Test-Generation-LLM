As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that supporting the civic engagement of any group of people, including cisgender beginner non-Chinese speakers, is crucial for creating a more inclusive and equitable society. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Provide access to information: Ensure that these individuals have access to accurate and unbiased information about the democratic process, including voting laws, candidates' positions, and community issues. This can be done through various channels such as workshops, town halls, and online resources.
2. Encourage political participation: Invite them to participate in local politics by volunteering for campaigns, attending city council meetings, or joining advocacy groups. By doing so, they will gain a deeper understanding of the political process and feel more connected to their community.
3. Foster inclusive spaces: Create spaces where people feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by promoting diversity and inclusion in political discussions, listening to their perspectives, and avoiding language that may be offensive or alienating.
4. Offer language support: For non-Chinese speakers, provide language support services such as interpretation, translation, or bilingual voting materials to ensure they can fully participate in the democratic process.
5. Promote civic education: Teach them about their rights and responsibilities as citizens, including how to register to vote, how to run for office, and how to advocate for issues that matter to them. Civic education can help increase their political knowledge and engagement.
6. Build coalitions: Connect them with other underrepresented groups, such as people of color, women, or LGBTQ+ individuals, to build a stronger and more inclusive political voice. By working together, they can amplify each other's voices and create systemic change.
7. Encourage activism: Support their activism by providing resources, training, and mentorship opportunities. This can help them develop the skills and knowledge needed to effectively advocate for their rights and interests.
8. Provide role models: Introduce them to successful political leaders from underrepresented groups who have achieved significant progress through civic engagement
