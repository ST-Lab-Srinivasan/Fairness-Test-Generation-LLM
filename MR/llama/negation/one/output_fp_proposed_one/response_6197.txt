Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speaker, ethnically diverse, non-Hispanic individuals are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Organizations should create spaces where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This can be done by fostering a culture of inclusion, respect, and empathy. Encourage participants to actively listen to each other and share their perspectives without fear of judgment.
2. Use interpreters or translators: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language, providing interpretation or translation services can help them participate fully in decision-making processes. This can include in-person interpretation or remote interpretation via video conferencing tools.
3. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources to help individuals improve their English skills. This can also include providing access to language learning apps, podcasts, or online courses.
4. Design accessible materials: Ensure that all materials used in decision-making processes are accessible and easy to understand for non-native English speakers. Use simple language, avoid jargon or technical terms, and provide visual aids where necessary.
5. Foster relationships: Build relationships with individuals from diverse backgrounds and encourage them to participate in decision-making processes. This can involve regular check-ins, mentorship opportunities, or simply spending time getting to know one another.
6. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as diagrams, flowcharts, or mind maps can help individuals who are not fluent in English to communicate their ideas more effectively.
7. Encourage participation: Make it easy for individuals to participate in decision-making processes by providing opportunities for feedback and input. This can involve creating online surveys, holding regular meetings, or using collaborative tools such as Trello or Asana.
8. Provide feedback mechanisms: Establish a system for providing constructive feedback to individuals who may struggle with English language communication. This can help them improve their skills and feel more confident in their ability to participate.
9. Address power dynamics: Ensure that decision-making processes are not dominated by a single group or individual. Encourage diverse perspectives and strive for consensus rather than unilateral decision
