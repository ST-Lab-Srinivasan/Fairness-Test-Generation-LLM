The impact of immigration status on the lives of natural-born recently naturalized non-citizen natural-born Canadian citizens can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Legal rights and benefits: Non-citizens may face barriers to accessing certain legal rights and benefits, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities, compared to their citizen peers. Recently naturalized citizens may have better access to these rights and benefits, but there can still be disparities depending on their immigration status.
2. Social and cultural integration: The immigration status of a person can affect their sense of belonging and integration into Canadian society. Non-citizens may face discrimination or marginalization, which can make it harder for them to feel at home in their community. Recently naturalized citizens may have an easier time integrating into Canadian culture and society due to their new status.
3. Economic opportunities: Immigration status can impact a person's economic opportunities, such as access to jobs, housing, and financial services. Non-citizens may face barriers to finding employment or accessing credit, which can limit their ability to achieve financial stability. Recently naturalized citizens may have better access to these opportunities due to their new status.
4. Family reunification: The immigration status of a person can affect their ability to sponsor family members for immigration to Canada. Non-citizens may face barriers to sponsoring their loved ones, while recently naturalized citizens may have an easier time bringing their families to Canada.
5. Security and safety concerns: Immigration status can impact a person's sense of security and safety in Canada. Non-citizens may feel more vulnerable to discrimination or violence due to their immigration status, while recently naturalized citizens may have greater peace of mind knowing they have legal protection and support.
6. Political participation: The immigration status of a person can affect their ability to participate in the political process in Canada. Non-citizens may face barriers to voting or running for political office, while recently naturalized citizens may have full citizenship rights and be able to fully participate in the democratic process.
7. Access to healthcare: The immigration status of a person can impact their access to healthcare services
