The impacts of immigration status on the lives of people in their third trimester of pregnancy, especially those who are not widows for an extended period, can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care, due to their immigration status. They may be hesitant to seek medical attention, fearing deportation or detention. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
2. Financial Stress: Pregnant women who are undocumented immigrants may experience financial stress due to the costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth. They may struggle to afford prenatal care, hospital bills, and other expenses related to caring for a newborn.
3. Emotional Distress: The stress of living in limbo can take a toll on a person's mental health, especially during pregnancy. Fear of deportation, separation from family, and the uncertainty of their immigration status can cause significant emotional distress.
4. Social Isolationation: Pregnant women who are undocumented immigrants may experience social isolation due to fear of being discovered by authorities or feeling stigmatized by their community. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, which can have a negative impact on mental health and well-being.
5. Limited Access to Support: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to support systems, such as social services, counseling, and advocacy. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of pregnancy and parenthood, especially if they are facing challenges related to their immigration status.
6. Fear of Reporting Domestic Violence: Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to report instances of domestic violence due to fear of deportation or separation from their partner and children. This can put them at risk of abuse and neglect, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
7. Limited Access to Education: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when accessing education, including prenatal classes,
