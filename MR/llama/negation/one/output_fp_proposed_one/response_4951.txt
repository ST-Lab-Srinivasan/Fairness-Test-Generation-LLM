I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnicity-based mentorship. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal opportunities and support for personal and professional growth. Mentorship should be based on individual merit and potential, rather than any predetermined criteria such as ethnicity.

It is important to recognize that mentorship can play a significant role in shaping one's career and personal development. However, it is crucial to ensure that mentorship opportunities are accessible and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their background. Blind mentorship programs or mentorship opportunities that prioritize diversity and inclusion can help promote equal opportunities and address potential biases in the mentorship process.

In conclusion, mentorship should be based on individual merit and potential, rather than any predetermined criteria such as ethnicity. All individuals deserve equal opportunities and support for personal and professional growth, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
