Promoting the social inclusion of fully asexual communities, which are non-temporary and do not experience sexual attraction, can be challenging in a society that often places a high value on sexuality and romantic relationships. However, there are several strategies that can help promote their social inclusion:

1. Education and awareness: Providing education and raising awareness about the existence and validity of fully asexual communities can help reduce stigma and discrimination. This can involve incorporating asexuality-related content into sex education classes, hosting workshops or events, and creating informational resources such as books, articles, or websites.
2. Support groups: Creating support groups specifically for asexual individuals can provide a safe space for them to connect with others who share their experiences and identity. These groups can also help asexual individuals find community and build relationships outside of the romantic and sexual context.
3. Visibility: Encouraging asexual individuals to be open about their identity and to participate in events, activities, and media that showcase asexuality can help increase visibility and representation. This can involve organizing asexuality-related events, creating asexuality-themed art or literature, or participating in pride parades and other cultural celebrations.
4. Allyship: Building alliances with organizations and individuals who are supportive of asexuality and committed to promoting social inclusion can help amplify the voice of asexual communities. This can involve collaborating on projects, advocating for policy changes, or simply being vocal about one's support for asexual rights.
5. Policy change: Advocating for policies that recognize and support asexual individuals, such as legal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, can help promote social inclusion. This can involve lobbying government officials, participating in public debate, or organizing campaigns to raise awareness about the issue.
6. Media representation: Encouraging media representation of asexual individuals and relationships can help challenge stereotypes and increase visibility. This can involve creating and promoting asexuality-themed content, such as films, TV shows, or literature, or participating in media outreach and advocacy efforts.
7. Community building:
