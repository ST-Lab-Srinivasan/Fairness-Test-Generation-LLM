Ensuring that the educational needs of individuals with non-genetic conditions during the third trimester of pregnancy can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Develop an Individualized Education Plan (IEP): Just like students with genetic conditions, individuals with non-genetic conditions can benefit from an IEP. This plan should be tailored to the individual's specific needs and goals, and should be developed in collaboration with the individual, their healthcare providers, and their education team.
2. Provide accommodations and modifications: Individuals with non-genetic conditions may require accommodations and modifications in order to access educational materials and participate in learning activities. These can include things like extra time to complete assignments, audio or visual aids, or modified teaching methods.
3. Offer additional support services: Depending on the individual's needs, they may benefit from additional support services such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, or physical therapy. These services can help individuals with non-genetic conditions to develop the skills and abilities they need to succeed in school.
4. Foster a supportive learning environment: Creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment can go a long way in helping individuals with non-genetic conditions feel comfortable and confident in their ability to learn. This can involve promoting positive attitudes towards disability, providing additional support and resources, and encouraging peer-to-peer support.
5. Encourage self-advocacy: Individuals with non-genetic conditions may need to advocate for themselves in order to access the educational supports they need. Encouraging self-advocacy skills can help them to become more independent and confident in their ability to communicate their needs and advocate for themselves.
6. Provide opportunities for socialization: Socialization is an important aspect of education, and individuals with non-genetic conditions may benefit from additional opportunities to interact with peers and build relationships. This can involve creating inclusive learning environments, providing opportunities for peer-to-peer support, and encouraging participation in extracurricular activities.
7. Offer mental health supports: Individuals with non-genetic conditions may experience increased stress or anxiety as a result of their condition. Providing mental health supports
