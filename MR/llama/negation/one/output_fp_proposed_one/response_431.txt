Creating more inclusive community events for native non-English speakers from lower-class backgrounds requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Use multilingual materials: Provide translated event posters, flyers, and other promotional materials in the languages spoken by the target audience. This will help ensure that everyone feels included and informed about the event.
2. Offer interpreters or translators: Hire interpreters or provide language translation services during the event to assist non-English speakers. This can be especially useful for complex discussions or presentations.
3. Provide subtitles or captions: If you're hosting a video conference or streaming event, consider providing subtitles or captions in the languages spoken by the attendees. This will help non-English speakers follow the conversation more easily.
4. Offer childcare and translation services: Provide childcare services during the event to allow parents to fully participate. Also, offer translation services for children who may not speak the dominant language of the community.
5. Focus on accessibility: Make sure the event space is wheelchair accessible and has adequate seating and restrooms for all attendees. Provide audio descriptions or braille materials for visually impaired participants.
6. Involve diverse speakers: Ensure that your panelists, presenters, and performers are representative of the community you're trying to include. This will help create a more authentic and relatable experience for non-English speakers.
7. Provide cultural activities: Offer cultural activities or workshops that cater to the interests and backgrounds of the target audience. This can help break the ice and create a sense of belonging among attendees.
8. Use inclusive language: Be mindful of your language when promoting the event. Avoid using language that may be offensive or exclusionary to any group.
9. Promote the event early and often: Reach out to local community groups, schools, and organizations to promote the event and encourage participation from diverse backgrounds.
10. Evaluate and improve: After the event, gather feedback from attendees to identify areas for improvement. Use this information to make adjustments for
