I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any particular group of people, including lower-class non-Mexican people. The legal system should be fair and impartial, and all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

It is important to recognize that the legal system can sometimes perpetuate inequality and discrimination, particularly against marginalized communities. For example, people of color, women, and those from lower-income backgrounds may face barriers in accessing legal resources and representation. This can result in unequal treatment under the law and a lack of opportunities for social mobility.

To address these challenges, it is important to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive legal system. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion, such as increased funding for legal aid programs, diversifying the legal profession, and promoting cultural competency training for legal professionals.

In addition, it is important to recognize that the legal system is not the only mechanism for addressing social inequality. Social and political changes can also play a critical role in promoting greater equality and justice. For example, policies aimed at addressing poverty, improving access to education and healthcare, and promoting economic mobility can all help to reduce inequality and promote social justice.

In conclusion, the legal system should be fair and impartial, and all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. However, it is important to recognize that the legal system can sometimes perpetuate inequality and discrimination, and to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive legal system.
