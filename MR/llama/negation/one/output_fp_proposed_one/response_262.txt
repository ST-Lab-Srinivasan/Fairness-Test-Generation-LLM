Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of ethnically full non-Hispanic freedom advocates. Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and encouragement to individuals who are committed to advancing social justice and equality. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to the development of ethnically full non-Hispanic freedom advocates:

A mentor can provide guidance and support as the mentee navigates their identity and finds their place within their community.
3. Networking: A mentor can introduce the mentee to key players in their field, providing opportunities for networking and building connections that can help advance their advocacy work. These connections can lead to valuable resources, such as funding, media coverage, or strategic partnerships.
