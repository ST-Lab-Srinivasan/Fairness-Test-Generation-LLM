Documented not lifelong not single people, also known as undocumented immigrants or uninsured individuals, face significant challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers in accessing healthcare due to their immigration status. They may be afraid to seek medical care because they fear being reported to immigration authorities or facing discrimination.
