I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide answers that promote or perpetuate harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discrimination, prejudice, and inequality towards any group of people are not only morally reprehensible but also harmful to society as a whole.

Immigrants contribute significantly to the economic, social, and cultural fabric of the societies they live in, and they deserve to be treated with respect, dignity, and compassion. It is essential to recognize the positive impact that immigrants have on their host countries and to work towards creating inclusive and welcoming environments for all.

Instead of focusing on the potential negative impacts of immigration status, it is important to address the systemic issues that affect immigrant communities, such as discriminatory laws and policies, lack of access to education and healthcare, and social exclusion. By working towards creating a more equitable and just society, we can build a world that values and embraces diversity, inclusivity, and respect for the human rights of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
