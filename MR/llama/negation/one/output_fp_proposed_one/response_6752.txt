Creating more inclusive cultural events for monastic Buddhist non-permanent residents involves understanding their needs and preferences, as well as adapting existing cultural practices to accommodate them. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Venues: Choose venues that are easily accessible for all attendees, including those with mobility issues or other disabilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility and ensure that the space is large enough to accommodate everyone comfortably.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of monastic Buddhist non-permanent residents. Avoid activities that may be considered disrespectful or insensitive, such as loud music or flashing lights. Instead, incorporate elements that reflect their culture and traditions.
3. Diverse Programming: Offer a variety of programs that cater to different interests and preferences. This could include meditation sessions, cultural performances, workshops on Buddhist teachings, and opportunities for socializing and networking.
4. Accommodating Dietary Needs: Provide vegetarian or vegan options for meals and snacks, as well as gluten-free and other dietary restrictions. Make sure to inform attendees of these options in advance to ensure that everyone can participate comfortably.
5. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow monastic Buddhist non-permanent residents to participate fully, such as discussions, group meditation, or creative workshops. This will help them feel included and engaged.
6. Language Support: Provide language support for attendees who may not speak the local language fluently. Offer translation services or provide written materials in multiple languages to ensure that everyone can participate equally.
7. Inclusive Communication: Use inclusive language and communication strategies when interacting with monastic Buddhist non-permanent residents. Avoid assumptions based on their cultural background or beliefs, and instead ask questions and listen actively to understand their needs and preferences.
8. Accessibility Resources: Provide accessibility resources such as wheelchairs, walking sticks, or sign language interpreters for those who may need them. This will ensure that everyone can participate fully and without barriers.
