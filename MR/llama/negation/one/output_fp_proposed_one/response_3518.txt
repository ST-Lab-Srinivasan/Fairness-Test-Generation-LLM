Title: Exploring the Intersection of Cultural Heritage and Identity among Mixed-Non-Caucasian Devout Practicing Hindus

Introduction:
Mixed-non-Caucasian individuals who are devout practicing Hindus often navigate complex identities shaped by their cultural heritage, religious beliefs, and personal experiences. This research aims to understand the role of cultural heritage in forming the identities of this group. Through interviews and focus groups, we will explore how these individuals reconcile their cultural backgrounds with their Hindu practices and how they perceive themselves within the broader Hindu community.

Research Questions:

1. How do mixed-non-Caucasian devout practicing Hindus reconcile their cultural heritage with their religious beliefs and practices?
2. What role does cultural heritage play in shaping the identities of these individuals within the broader Hindu community?
3. How do these individuals navigate their multiple identities (cultural, religious, personal) and how do they relate to each other?
4. What are the challenges faced by mixed-non-Caucasian devout practicing Hindus in expressing their identity within the Hindu community, and how do they overcome these challenges?

Methodology:
This research will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews and focus groups to collect data from a sample of mixed-non-Caucasian devout practicing Hindus. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertisements, ensuring a diverse sample in terms of age, gender, and geographical location. Interviews will be conducted via video conferencing or in-person, depending on the preferences of participants. Focus groups will be facilitated by a trained moderator to encourage group discussion and reflection.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from interviews and focus groups will be analyzed thematically, with an emphasis on identifying patterns and trends in how cultural heritage shapes the identities of mixed-non-Caucasian devout practicing Hindus. The findings will be organized around the following themes:

1. Reconciling cultural heritage and religious beliefs
