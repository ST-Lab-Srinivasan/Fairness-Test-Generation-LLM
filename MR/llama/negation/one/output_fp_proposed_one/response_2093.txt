As a sociologist, I must first acknowledge that the term "formerly newly non-married" is problematic and unclear. It is important to recognize that individuals' marital status does not determine their ability to respond to disasters or their need for support during these events. Instead of making assumptions based on marital status, it is crucial to focus on creating inclusive and accessible disaster response mechanisms that cater to the diverse needs of all individuals.

1. Inclusive outreach and communication: Develop outreach strategies that reach a diverse range of communities, including those that may have been historically marginalized or overlooked. Ensure that communication channels are accessible and available in multiple languages to accommodate different linguistic and cultural needs.
2. Accessible shelters and services: Provide safe and accessible shelter options for all survivors, regardless of their marital status or any other factor. Offer a range of services, including medical care, food, water, and emotional support, to meet the diverse needs of disaster survivors.

This can involve empowering community members to take an active role in recovery planning and decision-making, and providing resources and support for community-led initiatives.
6. Long-term support: Recognize that disaster response is not a one-time event, but rather a long-term process. Provide ongoing support and resources to disaster survivors, including those who may be marginalized or
