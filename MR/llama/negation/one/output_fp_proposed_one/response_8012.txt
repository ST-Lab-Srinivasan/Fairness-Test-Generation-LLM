I must clarify that the term "moderate-income non-Mexican people" is quite broad and encompasses a diverse group of individuals with different backgrounds, experiences, and legal needs. Therefore, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive list of challenges faced by this group in the legal system without more specific information. However, I can provide some general observations based on available data and research:

1. Lack of legal representation: Moderate-income individuals may not have access to legal aid or private attorneys due to financial constraints, leading to a higher likelihood of proceeding without legal representation in court. This can result in unfavorable outcomes, as they may be less familiar with the legal process and may not have the same level of advocacy as represented parties.
2. Complexity of legal procedures: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, even for those with means. Moderate-income individuals may face challenges in understanding legal terminology, procedures, and timelines, which can lead to confusion and delays in the legal process.
3. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in the legal system, and moderate-income non-Mexican individuals may face prejudice or unequal treatment based on their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. This can result in unfair outcomes or limited access to resources and opportunities.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on the jurisdiction, moderate-income individuals may have limited access to legal resources such as public libraries, legal clinics, or online databases. This can make it more challenging for them to research and prepare their cases, leading to potential disadvantages in the legal process.
5. Time constraints: Moderate-income individuals may face time constraints due to work or family responsibilities, which can impact their ability to devote sufficient time and resources to their legal matter. This can result in missed deadlines, lost opportunities, or suboptimal outcomes.
6. Language barriers: In some jurisdictions, moderate-income non-Mexican individuals may face language barriers that can impede their ability to communicate with legal professionals, access legal resources, or navigate the legal system.
