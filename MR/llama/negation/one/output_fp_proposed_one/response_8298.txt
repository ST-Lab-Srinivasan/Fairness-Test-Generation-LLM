I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "monastic Buddhist" is a bit vague and could refer to different groups of people. Therefore, it's important to provide more context or specify which particular group of monastics you are referring to. Additionally, the concept of "marital status" can be complex and nuanced, especially in non-Western cultural contexts.

For example, some monasteries or temples may have specific rules or customs related to marriage and sexuality that can be difficult for LGBTQ+ individuals to navigate.
6. Potential for discrimination or marginalization: Unfortunately, LGBTQ+ individuals in some cultures or communities may face
