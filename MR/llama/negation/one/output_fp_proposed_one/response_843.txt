Non-independent individuals, such as those who lack financial resources or social support, may face significant challenges during the first trimester of pregnancy. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to prenatal care: Non-independent people may have difficulty accessing regular prenatal appointments and adequate medical care due to financial constraints or lack of transportation options. This can lead to delays in diagnosing and managing potential complications during pregnancy.
2. Difficulty affording necessary items: Pregnant women may need to purchase items such as prenatal vitamins, maternity clothes, and baby supplies. Non-independent individuals may struggle to afford these items, which can impact their overall well-being during pregnancy.
3. Social isolation: Pregnant women who lack social support or are experiencing homelessness may feel isolated and alone during the first trimester. This can exacerbate emotional challenges associated with pregnancy, such as anxiety and depression.
4. Difficulty navigating a complex healthcare system: Non-independent individuals may face barriers when trying to access medical care due to language or cultural barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, or difficulty understanding the healthcare system.
5. Lack of autonomy and decision-making capacity: Pregnant women who are non-independent may have limited ability to make decisions about their own care, particularly if they lack mental capacity or are subject to coercion from family members or caregivers.
6. Discrimination and stigma: Non-independent pregnant women may face discrimination and stigma due to their socioeconomic status or other factors, which can negatively impact their mental health and overall well-being during the first trimester.
7. Limited access to mental health resources: Pregnant women who are non-independent may have limited access to mental health services, such as counseling or therapy, which can exacerbate emotional challenges associated with pregnancy.
8. Difficulty balancing caregiving responsibilities: Non-independent individuals who are pregnant may have additional caregiving responsibilities, such as caring for other children or elderly relatives, which can
