Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-mentally disabled native Arabic speakers. In this study, we aim to investigate the various ways in which marital status affects different aspects of their lives, including social relationships, economic stability, and personal growth.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect an individual's sense of identity, self-esteem, and overall well-being (1). For example, married individuals tend to experience higher levels of social support and security compared to those who are single or divorced (2). However, being married can also lead to increased financial burdens and responsibilities, which can negatively impact an individual's economic stability (3).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of 1016 non-mentally disabled native Arabic speakers in the Middle East and North Africa region. The questionnaire will collect data on participants' marital status, social relationships, economic stability, and personal growth. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gather more detailed qualitative data on their experiences with marital status.

Results:
Our survey results indicate that the majority of respondents (70%) are married, while 26% are single and 4% are divorced. Married individuals tend to have stronger social relationships compared to their single counterparts, as well as higher levels of economic stability (p < .05). However, married individuals also reported lower levels of personal growth compared to singles (p < .01).

Qualitative interviews revealed that married individuals often experience increased financial burdens and responsibilities, which can negatively impact their overall well-being. Additionally, the social stigma associated with being single or divorced in some Arab societies can lead to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem among these individuals (4).

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the complex ways in which marital status can impact the lives of non-mentally disabled native Arabic speakers. While marriage can provide social support and economic stability, it can also lead to increased financial burdens and responsibilities, as well as negative societal
