Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong single beginner non-Arabic speaker individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society. As a lifelong single beginner non-Arabic speaker individual, you may face challenges in navigating and understanding the cultural norms and values of the Arab world, especially if you are not exposed to the language and culture from an early age.
