Creating more inclusive social policies for unmarried non-temporary workers is essential to ensure that these individuals have access to the same rights and benefits as married or temporary workers. Here are some ways to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the changing family structure: Recognize that the traditional nuclear family structure is no longer the only norm. Unmarried non-temporary workers may come from a variety of family structures, including single-parent households, blended families, or same-sex couples.
2. Expand benefits and services: Offer benefits and services to unmarried non-temporary workers that are on par with those provided to married or temporary workers. This can include health insurance, paid leave, retirement plans, and other employee benefits.
3. Address discrimination: Ensure that policies do not inadvertently discriminate against unmarried non-temporary workers. For example, avoid making assumptions about an individual's family status based on their marital status or employment duration.
4. Encourage flexible work arrangements: Provide flexible work arrangements to accommodate the diverse needs of unmarried non-temporary workers. This can include telecommuting, job sharing, or flexible hours.
5. Increase access to affordable housing: Ensure that unmarried non-temporary workers have access to affordable and secure housing options. This can be achieved through policies such as rent control, subsidized housing, or assistance with down payments.
6. Improve education and training opportunities: Provide equal access to education and training opportunities for unmarried non-temporary workers. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, or degree programs.
7. Address financial inequality: Ensure that unmarried non-temporary workers have access to the same financial resources as married or temporary workers. This can be achieved through policies such as equal pay for equal work, affordable childcare options, and assistance with financial planning.
8. Encourage intergenerational support: Encourage unmarried non-temporary workers to form support networks with their families and communities. This can involve providing resources and support for caregiving responsibilities, as well as promoting intergenerational communication and collaboration.
