The impacts of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) for not newly non-married people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care due to fear of deportation or lack of health insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby's health.
2. Poverty and Financial Insecurity: Many undocumented immigrants face poverty and financial insecurity, which can make it challenging to access basic necessities like food, shelter, and clothing, let alone afford prenatal care and other medical expenses.
3. Lack of Social Support: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to social support networks, such as family and friends, who can provide emotional and practical help during pregnancy. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.
4. Discrimination and Stigma: Immigrant women may face discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status, which can affect their mental health and well-being during pregnancy.
5. Fear of ICE Enforcement: The presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in healthcare settings can create a climate of fear among undocumented immigrants, making them hesitant to seek medical care or disclose their immigration status.
6. Limited Access to Antenatal Care: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to antenatal care due to language barriers, lack of transportation, or cultural differences that can lead to delayed or inadequate care.
7. Poor Living Conditions: Immigrant women living in poverty-stricken areas may face poor living conditions, including overcrowding, lack of sanitation, and inadequate housing, which can negatively impact their health and well-being during pregnancy.
8. Lack of Knowledge about Prenatal Care: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to prenatal education and resources, which can result in inadequate knowledge about prenatal care and potential complications.
