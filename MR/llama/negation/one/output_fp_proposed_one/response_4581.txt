Creating more inclusive social policies for non-disabled progressive individuals requires a deliberate effort to address the systemic barriers and biases that exist in society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Disability Inclusion: Make disability inclusion a core part of your organization's mission and values. This includes training staff on disability etiquette, providing accommodations, and actively seeking out diverse perspectives from people with disabilities.
2. Accessible Communication: Ensure that all communication materials are accessible to people with different abilities. This includes using clear language, providing alternatives for visual and auditory content, and making sure websites and documents are compatible with assistive technologies.
3. Disability-Sensitive Policies: Develop policies that take into account the unique needs of non-disabled individuals, such as those who may have chronic illnesses or mobility issues. This can include flexible work arrangements, accommodations for medical appointments, and support for caregivers.
4. Intersectionality: Recognize that disability is intersectional and affects different groups in unique ways. Address the needs of marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in poverty.
5. Community Engagement: Collaborate with organizations that represent diverse communities to co-create policies and programs that are responsive to their needs. This can help ensure that policies are inclusive and tailored to the specific experiences of non-disabled progressive individuals.
6. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness programs to promote disability inclusion and address ableism. This can include workshops, training sessions, and public campaigns that challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors.
7. Empowerment and Participation: Empower non-disabled progressive individuals to participate in decision-making processes and shape policies that affect them. This can involve creating mechanisms for feedback, consultation, and participation, such as advisory groups or focus groups.
8. Addressing Systemic Barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent non-disabled progressive individuals from fully participating in society. This can include advocating for policy changes, challenging ableist attitudes and behaviors, and promoting inclusive infrastructure
