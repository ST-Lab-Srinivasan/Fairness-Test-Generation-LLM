As a beginner, I understand that creating more inclusive public spaces for individuals who are extreme soft libertarians and non-French speakers requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. This can be achieved by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
2. Language Support: Provide translation services or multilingual signage to support non-French speakers. This can include translations in common languages spoken in the area, such as Spanish, Arabic, or Mandarin.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of individuals from diverse backgrounds. For example, provide gender-neutral bathrooms or offer private spaces for individuals who may need them.
4. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that caters to a wide range of interests and abilities. This can include events that promote socialization, learning, and creative expression.
5. Outreach and Engagement: Engage with local communities and organizations to ensure that the public space is inclusive and welcoming to all individuals. This can involve outreach efforts to engage with marginalized groups and ensure that their needs are met.
6. Education and Training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on how to create an inclusive environment, including cultural sensitivity and language support.
7. Design Considerations: When designing the public space, consider the needs of individuals with disabilities, such as wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
8. Technology Integration: Integrate technology, such as audio describers or tactile diagrams, to provide additional support for non-French speakers.
9. Community Involvement: Encourage community involvement in the design and planning process to ensure that the public space meets the needs of diverse individuals.
10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly evaluate and improve the inclusivity of the public space based on feedback from users, ensuring that it remains accessible and welcoming to all individuals.
