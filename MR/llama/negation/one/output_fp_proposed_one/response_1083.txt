The impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant individuals, especially those who are non-Arabic speakers, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional stress: Pregnancy can be an emotional rollercoaster, and the added pressure of being a non-Arabic speaker in a new country can exacerbate this stress. Feelings of isolation and loneliness may be more pronounced for those who are not fluent in the local language.
2. Access to healthcare: Depending on the country and region, access to quality prenatal care may vary for non-Arabic speakers. Language barriers can make it challenging to communicate medical concerns or questions, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care.
