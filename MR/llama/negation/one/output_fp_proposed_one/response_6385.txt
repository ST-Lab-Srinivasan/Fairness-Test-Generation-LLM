Ensuring the healthcare needs of non-active duty middle-aged individuals are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their health. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Encourage preventive care: Provide access to routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations to identify potential health issues early on. This can help prevent or delay the onset of chronic conditions.
