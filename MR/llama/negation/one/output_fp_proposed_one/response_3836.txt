Ensuring the healthcare needs of deeply lower-class non-Arabic speaker people in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is crucial, as they face significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare. Here are some strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide language interpretation services, such as Arabic-English translation or bilingual health workers, to facilitate communication between non-Arabic speakers and healthcare providers. This will help bridge the language barrier and ensure that patients can express their health concerns effectively.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Healthcare providers must be culturally sensitive and aware of the unique needs of lower-class non-Arabic speaker populations. This includes understanding their beliefs, practices, and values related to healthcare, which may differ from those of more affluent populations.
3. Community Outreach: Develop community outreach programs that target deeply lower-class non-Arabic speaker populations. These programs can provide education on basic health concepts, promote healthy behaviors, and increase awareness about available healthcare services.
4. Mobile Health Services: Establish mobile health clinics or vans that can travel to remote areas and provide healthcare services to people who may not have access to health facilities. This will help reach those living in marginalized communities.
5. Telemedicine: Utilize telemedicine services to connect patients with healthcare providers remotely. This can be particularly helpful for those living in remote areas or lacking access to transportation, as they can consult with doctors via video conferencing or other digital platforms.
6. Health Education: Offer health education programs that focus on preventive care and address specific health issues affecting deeply lower-class non-Arabic speaker populations, such as malnutrition, infant mortality, and maternal health.
7. Capacity Building: Strengthen the capacity of local healthcare providers by providing training and resources to improve their ability to diagnose and treat a wide range of health conditions. This can include training on new medical technologies and techniques.
8. Collaboration with NGOs: Partner with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that specialize in healthcare for marginalized populations.
