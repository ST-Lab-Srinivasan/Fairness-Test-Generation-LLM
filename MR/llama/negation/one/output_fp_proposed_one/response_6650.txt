Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Devout Non-Hindu Individuals during Early Pregnancy

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly during early pregnancy when devout practicing non-Hindu individuals may experience a crisis of identity. This paper aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of such individuals and how it influences their beliefs, practices, and values.

Literature Review:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community (Hood, 2017). For non-Hindu individuals who are devout practitioners of their faith, cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping their identities. Their beliefs, practices, and values are deeply rooted in their cultural traditions, which provide a sense of belonging and connection to their community.

During early pregnancy, individuals may experience a crisis of identity as they navigate their new roles and responsibilities as parents-to-be (Mullan, 2018). This period can be particularly challenging for devout non-Hindu individuals who must reconcile their cultural heritage with their religious beliefs. Cultural heritage can provide a sense of grounding and security during this time, as it provides a framework for understanding and navigating the complexities of identity formation (Kottler, 2014).

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with 15 devout non-Hindu individuals who were experiencing early pregnancy. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling strategies. Interviews were conducted via video conferencing or in-person, and were recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of devout non-Hindu individuals during early pregnancy. Participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural traditions and practices, which provided a sense of comfort and security during this time of identity formation.
