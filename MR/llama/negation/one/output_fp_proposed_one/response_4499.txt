Ensuring the educational needs of non-Nigerian students in their late 30s requires a thoughtful and well-planned approach. Here are some strategies that can help meet their educational needs:

1. Assess their goals and motivation: Understand what drives these students to pursue education at this stage of their lives. Are they looking to upskill or reskill for career advancement, or do they have personal interests they want to explore? This information will help tailor the educational program to meet their specific needs.
2. Recognize prior learning: Non-Nigerian students in their late 30s may have significant work experience and other life experiences that can be leveraged for academic credit. Consider offering courses or programs that recognize prior learning and allow students to bypass certain requirements, saving time and money.
3. Flexible scheduling options: Many students in this age group may have family or professional commitments that make it difficult to attend traditional classes. Offer flexible scheduling options, such as online or part-time programs, to accommodate their needs.
4. Access to resources: Provide access to relevant resources, such as textbooks, research materials, and software, to ensure that students have the tools they need to succeed in their courses.
5. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of non-Nigerian students and create an inclusive learning environment. This can involve incorporating diverse perspectives and viewpoints into course content, as well as providing support services specifically tailored to their needs.
6. Networking opportunities: Provide opportunities for students to connect with peers and professionals in their field of interest. This can help them build valuable networking contacts and gain insights into their chosen career path.
7. Financial aid: Offer financial aid packages that take into account the unique needs of non-Nigerian students, such as scholarships, grants, or flexible payment plans.
8. Campus support services: Ensure that there are adequate support services available on campus, such as counseling, academic advising, and career guidance, to help students navigate their educational journey.
9. Collaboration with industry partners: Develop partnerships with local industries to provide opportunities for students to gain practical experience and build connections within their chosen field.
