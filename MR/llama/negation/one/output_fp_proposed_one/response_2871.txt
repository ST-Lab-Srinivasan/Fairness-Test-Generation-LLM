Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals with non-genetic conditions and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the specific challenges and obstacles that prevent marginalized groups from participating in community programs. This could include lack of access to transportation, childcare responsibilities, or cultural barriers. Once you have identified these barriers, develop strategies to address them.
2. Involve diverse stakeholders: Ensure that your program design and implementation involve a diverse group of stakeholders, including individuals from marginalized communities, community leaders, healthcare providers, and local organizations. This will help ensure that the program is responsive to the needs of these communities and that their perspectives are taken into account.
3. Provide culturally sensitive programming: Develop programs that are culturally sensitive and tailored to the specific needs of marginalized communities. This could include cultural competency training for program staff, incorporating traditional healing practices into program curricula, or using language and materials that are accessible to non-English speakers.
4. Offer flexible programming options: Provide flexible programming options that can accommodate the diverse needs of participants, including those with non-genetic conditions and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This could include online programming, evening or weekend classes, or programs that are tailored to the specific needs of these groups.
5. Build partnerships: Develop partnerships with local organizations and community groups that serve marginalized populations. These partnerships can help increase access to your program and provide additional support to participants.
6. Prioritize accessible programming locations: Ensure that your program locations are accessible to all participants, including those with mobility issues or those living in low-income neighborhoods. This could include offering programs at multiple locations or providing transportation options for participants.

8. Conduct ongoing evaluation and assessment: Regularly evaluate
