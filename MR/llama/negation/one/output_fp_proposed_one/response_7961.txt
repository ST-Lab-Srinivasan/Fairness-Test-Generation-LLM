Creating more inclusive housing policies for non-reservist mid-50s individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various factors, including affordability, accessibility, and discrimination. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Increase the supply of affordable housing: Developing more affordable housing options, such as rental units or homeownership programs, can help make housing more accessible for mid-50s individuals who may not have accumulated enough wealth to purchase a home. Governments can provide incentives for developers to build affordable housing, or invest in programs that help low-income individuals purchase homes.
2. Implement rent control measures: Rent control can help prevent sudden increases in housing costs, which can be particularly challenging for mid-50s individuals who may have limited financial resources. Governments can establish rent control mechanisms to regulate rent increases and protect tenants from displacement.
3. Promote inclusive zoning policies: Zoning laws can affect the types of housing that are available in a particular area. Encouraging mixed-use development, allowing for multi-unit dwellings, and promoting micro-units can help create more diverse and inclusive neighborhoods.
4. Provide financial assistance: Governments can offer financial assistance programs, such as down payment assistance or mortgage subsidies, to help mid-50s individuals purchase homes. These programs can help reduce the financial burden of homeownership and make it more accessible for those who may not have accumulated enough wealth.
5. Address discrimination: Discrimination based on age, race, gender, or other factors can prevent mid-50s individuals from accessing housing. Governments can implement anti-discrimination laws to protect tenants and homebuyers from unfair treatment.
6. Encourage intergenerational living: Allowing multi-generational households can help non-reservist mid-50s individuals who may be living with family members, such as adult children or aging parents, to continue living in their homes without facing displacement. Governments can amend zoning laws to allow for larger housing units or multi-unit dwellings that accommodate diverse household compositions.
7. Foster community land trusts: Community land trusts (CLTs)
