As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their wealth or marital status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Creating more inclusive social policies for these groups requires understanding their unique needs and challenges, while also addressing the broader societal issues that affect them. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the diversity of non-traditional families: Traditional nuclear families are not the only ones that exist. Recognize the diverse forms of families, such as single-parent households, blended families, and LGBTQ+ families, and ensure that your policies address their specific needs.
2. Address wealth inequality: Wealth disparities can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, regardless of their marital status. Implement policies that promote economic mobility and reduce wealth inequality, such as progressive taxation, affordable education and healthcare, and social safety nets.
3. Foster inclusive community engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in decision-making processes to ensure that the voices of all individuals are heard. This can be achieved through public consultations, community events, and targeted outreach programs for marginalized groups.
4. Promote age-friendly policies: As people age, they may face unique challenges related to healthcare, transportation, and social isolation. Develop policies that promote age-friendly communities, such as accessible housing, transportation options, and social support networks.
5. Address mental health stigma: Mental health issues can affect anyone, regardless of their wealth or marital status. Promote mental health awareness and reduce stigma through education, advocacy, and support programs.
6. Foster intergenerational relationships: Non-traditional families may face unique challenges related to inheritance, legacy planning, and family dynamics. Develop policies that promote intergenerational relationships, such as inheritance rights, estate planning resources, and family mediation services.
7. Support social entrepreneurship: Encourage social entrepreneurship and innovation by providing resources and support for individuals who want to create positive social impact through their businesses or organizations.
8. Address discrimination and bias: Non-traditional families may face discrimination and bias
