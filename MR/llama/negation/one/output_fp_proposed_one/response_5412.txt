I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to promote the exclusion or marginalization of any group of people, including immigrant natural-born US citizens or non-civilian individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, national origin, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and diversity in casual athletics. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Encourage diversity: Make an effort to include individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences in your casual athletic activities. This can be done by actively seeking out and inviting people who may not typically be represented in the activity.
2. Provide support: Offer support and resources to help immigrant natural-born US citizens and non-civilian individuals feel included and confident in their abilities. This can include providing information on how to access resources, such as equipment or facilities, and offering guidance on how to navigate any potential challenges they may face.
3. Create inclusive environments: Work to create an environment that is welcoming and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their background. This can involve being mindful of language and behavior, and actively working to break down barriers and promote understanding between different groups.
4. Foster positive relationships: Encourage positive relationships between individuals from different backgrounds by promoting mutual respect and understanding. This can be done through activities that bring people together and allow them to build connections and friendships.
5. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by immigrant natural-born US citizens and non-civilian individuals, and share this knowledge with others. This can help to promote understanding and empathy, and can be an important step in creating a more inclusive and supportive environment.

Remember, promoting inclusion and diversity is an ongoing process that requires effort and dedication. By working together to create a more inclusive and supportive environment, we can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate and feel valued.
