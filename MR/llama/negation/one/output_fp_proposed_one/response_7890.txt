Ensuring that the educational needs of native Arabic speaker non-nationals are met requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that addresses their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Educators: Provide training to educators on cultural competency and sensitivity towards non-native Arabic speakers, particularly those from Middle Eastern and North African countries. This will help them understand the students' cultural backgrounds and needs.
2. Bilingual Education Programs: Offer bilingual education programs that cater to the needs of native Arabic speakers. These programs can provide a supportive environment where students can learn in their native language while also developing proficiency in the host country's language.
3. Adaptation Support: Provide adaptation support to help non-national students adjust to the new educational system, culture, and society. This can include counseling services, mentorship programs, and social events that facilitate integration.
4. Language Assessment and Support: Offer language assessments to identify the level of proficiency of native Arabic speakers. Provide language support and resources to help them improve their language skills, particularly in reading, writing, and speaking.
5. Inclusive Curriculum Design: Develop an inclusive curriculum that reflects the diverse cultural backgrounds of non-national students. This can include incorporating texts, images, and other resources that represent their culture and experiences.
6. Community Outreach and Partnerships: Foster partnerships with local community organizations, cultural centers, and mosques to provide additional support and resources to native Arabic speakers. These partnerships can help address specific needs and challenges faced by this population.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that address the educational needs of non-national students. This can include pushing for more funding for bilingual education programs, expanding language support services, and creating more inclusive curriculum design.
8. Parent and Community Engagement: Encourage parental involvement and community engagement through workshops, meetings, and other activities that promote cross-cultural understanding and collaboration. This can help build a supportive network for native Arabic speakers and their families.
