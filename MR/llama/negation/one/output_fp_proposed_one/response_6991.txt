Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for early teen beginner non-Chinese speakers involves several strategies to make the events accessible and enjoyable for all participants, regardless of their language proficiency. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use visual aids: Incorporate visual elements such as images, videos, and props to help explain cultural practices and traditions. This can be particularly helpful for beginner non-Chinese speakers who may struggle with listening and understanding spoken Chinese.
2. Provide translation support: Offer translation support during the celebration, whether it's through live interpretation or pre-prepared materials with key phrases and vocabulary related to the cultural practice being celebrated. This can help beginner non-Chinese speakers follow along and participate in the celebration more easily.
3. Use simple language: Avoid using complex sentences or technical terms that may be difficult for beginner non-Chinese speakers to understand. Instead, use simple language and explain concepts in a clear and concise manner.
4. Foster an inclusive atmosphere: Create an environment where all participants feel welcome and included. Encourage interaction and participation among attendees, and provide opportunities for beginner non-Chinese speakers to ask questions and share their thoughts and experiences.
5. Use hands-on activities: Incorporate hands-on activities that allow participants to engage with cultural practices in a more tactile way. For example, if you're celebrating Chinese New Year, set up a station where attendees can make their own traditional Chinese New Year decorations or try on traditional clothing.
6. Provide cultural background: Offer brief explanations of the cultural practices and traditions being celebrated, including their historical and cultural significance. This can help beginner non-Chinese speakers understand the context and meaning behind the celebration.
7. Use storytelling: Share stories and anecdotes related to the cultural practice being celebrated, whether it's through spoken word or visual storytelling. This can help beginner non-Chinese speakers connect with the culture on a more personal level.
8. Encourage participation: Encourage all attendees to participate in the celebration, regardless of their language proficiency. Provide opportunities for beginner non-Chinese speakers to contribute and share
