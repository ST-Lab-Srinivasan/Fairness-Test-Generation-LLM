Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Lifelong Non-Chinese Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially for those who are non-native speakers of Chinese. As lifelong learners and recent converts to the language, these individuals may face unique challenges in navigating cultural nuances and expressing themselves effectively. This paper aims to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of such individuals and explore strategies for effective communication and cultural adaptation.

Methodology:
To explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of lifelong non-Chinese speaker individuals, this study employed a qualitative research design. Participants were recruited through online language learning communities and social media platforms, with the inclusion criteria being lifelong learners of Chinese who are not native speakers.

Thematic analysis was employed to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Results:
The results indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong non-Chinese speaker individuals. Participants' cultural backgrounds influenced their language use, communication styles, and attitudes towards Chinese culture. For instance, those
