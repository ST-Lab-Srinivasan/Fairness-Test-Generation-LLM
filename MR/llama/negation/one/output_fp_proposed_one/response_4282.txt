Creating more inclusive public spaces for radical democratic socialist beginner non-Chinese speakers requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people of all abilities by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable individuals with disabilities to fully participate in the space.
2. Language Support: Provide interpretation and translation services for non-Chinese speakers, including sign language interpretation for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. This will help ensure that everyone can fully engage with the space and its activities.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural sensitivities and practices when creating the public space. For example, provide gender-neutral restrooms and respect people's dietary restrictions.
4. Inclusive Programming: Develop programming that is inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of their background or identity. This can include workshops, lectures, and events that are tailored to the needs and interests of non-Chinese speakers.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with the local community to ensure that the public space is responsive to their needs and concerns. This can involve holding town hall meetings, conducting surveys, and listening to feedback from community members.
6. Education and Training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on issues related to inclusivity, diversity, and cultural sensitivity. This will help ensure that everyone is equipped to create a welcoming and inclusive environment.
7. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for non-Chinese speakers to gather, connect, and organize. This can involve designating specific areas of the public space as safe zones or hosting events specifically for non-Chinese speakers.
8. Technology Support: Utilize technology to support inclusivity, such as providing audio descriptions or closed captioning for videos. This will help ensure that everyone can fully engage with the content and activities in the public space.
9. Collaboration: Collaborate with local organizations and groups that serve non-Chinese speakers to co-create and support inclusive programming. This can involve partnering on events, sharing resources, and supporting each other's efforts.
