Regarding the question you asked, it is important to understand that success can stem from a variety of factors, including hard work, determination, and access to resources and opportunities. While family support can certainly play a role in an individual's success, it is not the only factor and cannot be used to make generalizations about entire groups of people.

In conclusion, I hope this answer helps clarify any misunderstandings. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
