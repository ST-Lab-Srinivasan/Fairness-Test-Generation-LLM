Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for late 30s native non-Arabic speaker individuals requires understanding their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer multilingual support: Provide translation services or bilingual staff to assist non-Arabic speakers during events, such as interpreters for sign language or real-time translation devices.
2. Simplify cultural explanations: Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-Arabic speakers. Instead, use clear and concise language to explain cultural practices and traditions.
3. Provide visual aids: Use images, videos, or infographics to help non-Arabic speakers understand cultural customs and rituals. This can be especially helpful for individuals who are visually inclined or have difficulty processing written information.
4. Offer hands-on activities: Organize interactive workshops or activities that allow non-Arabic speakers to participate and experience cultural practices firsthand, such as cooking classes or calligraphy sessions.
5. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the celebration's programming includes a variety of voices, perspectives, and experiences. This can be achieved by featuring guest speakers from diverse backgrounds or showcasing cultural performances that reflect the diversity of the community.
6. Provide accessible venues: Choose venues that are wheelchair accessible and have amenities for individuals with disabilities. This can include braille signage, audio descriptions, or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation.
7. Offer flexible participation options: Allow non-Arabic speakers to participate in events remotely, such as through live streaming or virtual reality experiences. This can help individuals who may not be able to attend in person due to mobility issues or other constraints.
8. Provide cultural orientation sessions: Organize orientation sessions before the celebration for non-Arabic speakers to learn about cultural norms and customs. This can help them feel more comfortable and confident during the event.
9. Encourage feedback: Solicit feedback from non-Arabic speakers throughout the planning process to ensure that their needs are being met and that they feel included in the celebration.
