Creating more inclusive cultural programs for nominal non-Muslim moderate-income individuals requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Understand the needs and interests of the target audience: Conduct research to identify the specific cultural interests and preferences of this demographic. This could involve surveys, focus groups, or interviews to gather feedback on what types of cultural programs they would find most appealing.
2. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to a wide range of people by offering accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
