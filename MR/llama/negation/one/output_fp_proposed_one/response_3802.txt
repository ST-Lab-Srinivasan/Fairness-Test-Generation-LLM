Promoting the social inclusion of ethnic African non-Americans who are not living in deep poverty requires addressing the systemic and structural barriers that prevent these individuals from fully participating in society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Awareness: Educate the broader community about the experiences, challenges, and strengths of ethnic African non-Americans. Raise awareness about the importance of inclusion and diversity, and how it benefits society as a whole.
2. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in decision-making processes that affect ethnic African non-American communities. This can be done through mechanisms such as community consultations, surveys, and focus groups.
3. Economic Empowerment: Implement policies and programs that promote economic empowerment of ethnic African non-Americans, such as access to education and job training, microfinance initiatives, and entrepreneurship support.
4. Healthcare Access: Ensure equal access to quality healthcare for ethnic African non-Americans. This can be achieved by improving healthcare infrastructure, providing financial support for healthcare services, and addressing cultural and language barriers that may exist in the healthcare system.
5. Civic Engagement: Encourage civic engagement and participation in the democratic process among ethnic African non-Americans. This can be done by providing voter education and registration drives, and ensuring that their voices are heard in decision-making processes at all levels of government.
6. Cultural Preservation: Support the preservation and celebration of ethnic African cultural heritage and traditions. This can be achieved through initiatives such as cultural festivals, exhibitions, and community events that promote intercultural exchange and understanding.
7. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that address systemic barriers to inclusion faced by ethnic African non-Americans. This can include changes to education policies, employment laws, and social welfare programs to ensure greater equity and access.
8. Intersectionality: Recognize the intersectional nature of discrimination and marginalization experienced by ethnic African non-Americans. Addressing these intersections is crucial for achieving true inclusion and social justice.
