Native non-Arabic speakers who are recent immigrants to the United States may face a range of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: The legal system in the US is largely based on English, and non-English speakers may struggle to navigate it without adequate language support. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulties in accessing legal services.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the US is shaped by its cultural and historical context, which may be unfamiliar or even alien to recent immigrants from other cultures. This can lead to misunderstandings of legal concepts and practices, as well as difficulties in navigating the system.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Non-English speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as legal aid organizations, interpreters, and translators. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access the help they need.
4. Discrimination and bias: Recent immigrants may face discrimination and bias in the legal system, particularly if they are from marginalized communities. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of access to legal resources.

6. Limited access to legal education: Many recent immigrants may not have had access to legal education in their home countries, or they may not have been exposed to the legal system in their home country. This lack of knowledge and understanding can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system in the US.

This can lead to difficulties in finding the right court or tribunal, understanding the legal process, and navigating the various steps involved in resolving a legal issue.
