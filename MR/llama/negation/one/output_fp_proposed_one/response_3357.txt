Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of hetero Marxist individuals. Hetero Marxists are individuals who identify as both queer and Marxist, and their understanding of cultural heritage is informed by both queer theory and Marxist theory. Here are some ways that cultural heritage shapes the identities of hetero Marxist individuals:

1. Challenging dominant narratives: Hetero Marxists challenge the dominant narratives of culture, which often marginalize or erase non-normative sexualities and genders. By examining cultural artifacts, practices, and traditions through a queer lens, they can uncover hidden histories and experiences that challenge mainstream understandings of identity and culture.
2. Intersectionality: Hetero Marxists recognize that identity is intersectional and that cultural heritage is shaped by multiple factors such as race, class, gender, and sexuality. They examine how cultural artifacts and practices intersect with these different identities to create complex and nuanced meanings and experiences.
3. Subverting binaries: Hetero Marxists subvert traditional binary oppositions that structure culture, such as public/private, rational/emotional, or masculine/feminine. They argue that these binaries are not fixed or natural but are socially constructed and can be challenged and transformed.
4. Emphasizing collective identity: Hetero Marxists emphasize the importance of collective identity and community in shaping cultural heritage. They recognize that cultural artifacts and practices are not just individual expressions but are also social and political acts that reflect and reinforce larger structural power dynamics.
5. Politicizing culture: Hetero Marxists politicize culture by examining how cultural artifacts and practices are used to maintain or challenge existing power structures. They argue that culture is not just a reflection of society but is also a tool for social change.
6. Challenging heteronormativity: Hetero Marxists challenge the dominant norms of heterosexuality and gender binarism that shape cultural heritage. They recognize that non-normative sexualities and genders have been marginalized and erased from cultural narratives and seek to recuperate and celebrate these experiences in their reinterpretation of cultural heritage.
