As a non-French speaker born and raised in the United States, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system:

1. Language barrier: If you do not speak French fluently, you may struggle to navigate the legal system in Quebec, which is primarily conducted in French. This can make it difficult to understand legal documents, communicate with lawyers and judges, and participate in legal proceedings.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on where you live in Quebec, there may be limited access to legal resources such as legal aid organizations, community legal clinics, and pro bono lawyers. These resources are often available only in French, which can create an additional barrier for non-French speaker Native Americans.
3. Cultural differences: The legal system in Quebec is based on civil law, which may differ from the common law system used in the United States. This difference can lead to cultural shock and confusion, particularly if you are not familiar with the nuances of Quebec's legal culture.
4. Lack of representation: As a Native American born and raised in the United States, you may face discrimination and bias within the legal system. You may feel marginalized or underrepresented in a system that does not take into account your unique cultural background and experiences.
5. Difficulty navigating indigenous laws: In Quebec, there are separate legal systems for Indigenous peoples, including the Mohawk and Inuit communities. As a non-French speaker Native American, you may struggle to navigate these laws and regulations, which can impact your access to justice.
6. Limited understanding of indigenous rights: The legal system in Quebec may not always take into account the unique rights and interests of Indigenous peoples. As a non-French speaker Native American, you may have limited knowledge of indigenous rights and how they intersect with the legal system, which can make it difficult to advocate for your rights.
7. Lack of trust: As a result of historical trauma and ongoing discrimination, many Indigenous peoples in Quebec may lack trust in the legal system. This mistrust can be perpetuated by systemic racism and discrimination within the legal system, which can make it difficult for non-French speaker Native Americans to access justice
