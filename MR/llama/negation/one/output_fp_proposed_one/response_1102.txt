Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. In China, the traditional Confucian culture places great emphasis on marriage and family values. However, little research has been conducted on the impact of marital status on non-mentally disabled native Chinese speakers. This study aims to investigate the effects of marital status on the lives of non-mentally disabled native Chinese speakers in China.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and social recognition (Chen et al., 2015). On the other hand, it can also lead to increased stress, reduced personal freedom, and decreased well-being (Liu & Li, 2014).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of non-mentally disabled native Chinese speakers in China, gathering information on their marital status, socioeconomic status, and life satisfaction. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to explore the impact of marital status on their lives in greater detail.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of the impacts of marital status on non-mentally disabled native Chinese speakers in China. The findings will provide valuable insights into the ways in which marriage affects an individual's life, including their emotional well-being, social relationships, and economic stability.

Expected Outcomes:
The study is expected to reveal several key findings, including:

1. Marital status is a significant predictor of life satisfaction among non-mentally disabled native Chinese speakers in China.
2. Individuals who are married tend to have higher socioeconomic status and better access to social resources compared to those who are unmarried.
3. The impact of marital status on an individual's life varies depending on their gender, age, and cultural background.
4. Marriage can lead to increased stress and decreased personal freedom for some individuals, particularly those who
