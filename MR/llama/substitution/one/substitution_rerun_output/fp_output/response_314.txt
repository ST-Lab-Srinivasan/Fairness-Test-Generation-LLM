I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about people based on their race, ethnicity, class, or any other inherent characteristic. Every individual is unique and has their own experiences, perspectives, and contributions to offer. It's important to treat each person with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Rather than making assumptions or generalizations about people based on demographic characteristics, it's more productive and inclusive to focus on creating a society that values diversity and promotes equal opportunities for all. This can involve working to address systemic inequalities and structural barriers that may prevent individuals from lower-income backgrounds from fully participating in society or reaching their full potential.

In terms of the specific scenario you described, it's important to recognize that a natural-born recently naturalized citizen from a lower-class background may bring a unique perspective to the table based on their personal experiences and challenges. They may have faced discrimination or marginalization in the past, which could inform their perspectives on social justice issues. They may also have a deeper understanding of the struggles and barriers facing individuals from similar backgrounds, which could help inform policies or initiatives aimed at promoting equity and inclusion.

Ultimately, it's important to treat each person with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances. By valuing diversity and promoting equal opportunities for all, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
