Creating more inclusive social policies for non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various forms of discrimination and marginalization they may face. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Advocate for policies that address intersectionality: Cisgender individuals may experience different forms of discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or other aspects of their identity. Policies that acknowledge and address these intersections of oppression can help create a more inclusive society.
2. Promote access to education and employment: Non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals may face barriers to accessing quality education and job opportunities, which can perpetuate poverty and limit their potential for social mobility. Policies that prioritize education and job training, as well as anti-discrimination measures in the workplace, can help address these disparities.
3. Support affordable housing and transportation: Many non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals may struggle to access affordable housing and transportation, which can limit their ability to participate fully in society. Policies that prioritize affordable housing options and public transportation can help address these challenges.
4. Address health disparities: Non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare, which can exacerbate existing health disparities. Policies that prioritize universal health coverage, mental health support, and access to healthy food and exercise opportunities can help address these disparities.
5. Promote cultural competency in government services: Government services should be designed with the needs of non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals in mind, taking into account their unique experiences and challenges. Cultural competency training for government employees can help ensure that services are delivered in a way that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals.
6. Encourage community engagement: Non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals may feel marginalized or disconnected from their communities, which can perpetuate feelings of isolation and exclusion. Policies that encourage community engagement and participation in decision-making processes can help build more inclusive and connected communities.
