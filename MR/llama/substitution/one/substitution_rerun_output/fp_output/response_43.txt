The impact of military status on the lives of wedded mid-50s individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: Military deployments can be challenging and stressful, particularly for spouses who may feel anxious about their partner's safety and well-being.
2. Financial strain: Military life can involve frequent moves, which can lead to financial instability and uncertainty. Spouses may also face difficulties managing the family finances while their partner is away.
3. Social isolation: Military spouses often experience social isolation due to the frequent moves and the partner's absence. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from friends and community.
4. Emotional toll: The stress of military life can take an emotional toll on spouses, particularly those who experience multiple deployments or extended periods of separation.
5. Impact on children: Military moves can be difficult for children, leading to changes in schools, friendships, and living situations. This can cause emotional distress and difficulty adjusting to new environments.
6. Challenges with career development: Military spouses may face challenges advancing their careers due to frequent moves and the need to uproot their lives.
7. Lack of support: Military spouses often feel unsupported by their partner's chain of command or military leadership, particularly in times of crisis.
8. Difficulty maintaining relationships: The demands of military life can make it challenging for spouses to maintain relationships with friends and family, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection.
9. Emotional preparation: Military spouses may need to develop emotional resilience and coping strategies to deal with the unique challenges of military life.
10. Access to resources: Military spouses may have access to resources such as spouse support groups, mental health services, and financial assistance programs, which can help them navigate the challenges of military life.

It's important to note that every military couple's experience is unique, and the impact of military status on their lives will depend on a variety of factors, including the length and frequency of deployments, the age and health of the spouse, and the individual's coping mechanisms
