As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. It is important to recognize that systemic inequalities and biases exist in society, and data can play a crucial role in bringing these issues to light. Here are some ways data can help highlight the issues faced by non-wealthy, natural-born US citizen individuals:

1. Income inequality: Data on income distribution can help identify areas where the wealth gap is widening between the rich and the poor. For example, a report by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 1% of earners in the US now hold more than 40% of the country's total wealth, while the bottom 90% hold just 27%.
2. Wealth disparities: Data on wealth distribution can reveal how wealth is concentrated among a small group of individuals, leaving little for others to inherit. For instance, according to a report by the Federal Reserve, the top 10% of wealth holders in the US hold 85% of the country's total wealth, while the bottom 90% hold just 15%.
3. Educational disparities: Data on educational attainment can highlight how some groups have less access to quality education than others. For example, a report by the National Center for Education Statistics found that African American and Hispanic students are more likely to attend schools with limited resources compared to their white peers.
4. Healthcare disparities: Data on healthcare access can reveal how some groups have less access to quality healthcare than others. For instance, a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that non-white individuals are more likely to experience barriers when trying to access healthcare services.
5. Criminal justice disparities: Data on criminal justice outcomes can highlight how some groups are disproportionately represented on crime rates and incarceration rates. For example, a report by the NAACP found that African Americans are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of whites in the US.
6. Housing disparities: Data on housing affordability can reveal how some groups have less access to affordable housing than others. For instance, a report by the National Low Income
