Military status can have a significant impact on the life of an individual who loses their spouse in their late 30s, especially if they are left alone without any support. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Emotional Distress: The loss of a spouse can be devastating, and the added stress of military status can exacerbate the emotional challenges.
