Creating more inclusive social policies for average earners who are not in a relationship requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Acknowledge the challenges faced by average earners who are not in a relationship: This group faces significant barriers when it comes to accessing social services and benefits, such as healthcare, housing, and education. Policymakers must recognize these challenges and work to address them through targeted policies.
2. Foster affordable housing options: Many average earners who are not in a relationship struggle to find affordable housing. Policymakers can create incentives for developers to build more affordable housing units, or provide subsidies for renters.
3. Improve access to healthcare: Average earners who are not in a relationship may have limited access to healthcare due to lack of insurance or financial resources. Policymakers can work to expand Medicaid coverage, create sliding scale payment options, and provide subsidies for low-income individuals.
4. Provide financial assistance: Average earners who are not in a relationship may struggle to make ends meet due to limited financial resources. Policymakers can provide financial assistance through programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Child Tax Credit (CTC).
5. Support education and job training: Many average earners who are not in a relationship may lack access to job training and education opportunities. Policymakers can provide funding for vocational training programs, adult education, and job placement services.
6. Address systemic barriers to economic mobility: Average earners who are not in a relationship may face systemic barriers to economic mobility, such as discrimination or lack of access to networks and resources. Policymakers can work to address these issues through anti-discrimination policies and initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion.
7. Foster social connections: Average earners who are not in a relationship may feel isolated or disconnected from their communities. Policymakers can provide funding for community organizations and social events that bring people together and foster social connections.
8. Create inclusive benefits: Many social programs have eligibility requirements based on marital status
