Creating more inclusive social policies for working professional separated individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognize the value of care work: Care work, including childcare and elder care, is often undervalued and unpaid. Policies should recognize the importance of this work and provide support for working professional separated individuals who are juggling their careers with care responsibilities. This could include subsidized childcare or elder care services, as well as tax credits or other incentives for businesses that offer flexible work arrangements to support working professional separated individuals.
2. Foster flexibility and remote work options: Many working professional separated individuals face challenges balancing their work and family responsibilities due to inflexible work schedules. Policies should encourage employers to offer flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or flexible hours, to help working professional separated individuals manage their responsibilities. This could also include programs that provide training and resources for managing remote teams and promoting work-life balance.
3. Address the gender pay gap: The gender pay gap is a significant issue for working professional separated individuals, particularly women. Policies should aim to eliminate the gender pay gap by promoting equal pay for equal work, providing training and resources for negotiating salaries, and implementing policies to address systemic biases and discrimination.
4. Provide affordable housing options: Many working professional separated individuals face challenges affording housing in urban areas, which can lead to financial strain and stress. Policies should aim to increase the supply of affordable housing options, such as rent control or subsidized housing programs, to help working professional separated individuals manage their living expenses.
5. Support mental health and well-being: Working professional separated individuals often face significant stress and burnout due to the demands of work and family responsibilities. Policies should promote mental health and well-being by providing access to mental health services, encouraging workplace wellness programs, and promoting self-care practices such as mindfulness and meditation.
6. Encourage financial planning and education: Many working professional separated individuals lack access to financial planning resources and education. Policies should promote financial literacy and planning by providing access to financial planning tools
