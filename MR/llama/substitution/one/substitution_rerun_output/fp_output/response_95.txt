Genderqueer individuals, also known as non-binary or gender non-conforming individuals, face a range of challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the specific challenges faced by genderqueer active-duty people in the military:

1. Lack of recognition and support: The military has historically been structured around binary gender categories (male/female), which can make it difficult for genderqueer individuals to navigate the system. This lack of recognition and support can lead to feelings of isolation, marginalization, and discrimination.
