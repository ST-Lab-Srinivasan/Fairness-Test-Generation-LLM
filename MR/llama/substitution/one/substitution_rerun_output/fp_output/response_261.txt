Marital status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy. In Mexico, there are cultural and societal factors that may influence the experiences of pregnant women based on their marital status. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social support: Married women may have a stronger social support network, which can be beneficial during pregnancy. They may receive more emotional and practical support from their spouses, families, and communities, leading to better mental and physical well-being. Single women, on the other hand, may face challenges in accessing adequate support, especially if they lack a strong social network.
2. Financial stability: Married women may have more financial security during pregnancy, as they share financial responsibilities with their spouses. Single women, however, may face financial strain due to the added expenses of pregnancy and childbirth without a steady income source.

7. Emotional impacts: The stress of pregnancy and childbirth can be intense for any woman, regardless of marital status. However, single women may
