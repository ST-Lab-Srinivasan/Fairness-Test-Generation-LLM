I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "man hetero people" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in the LGBTQ+ community. The term "heterosexual" refers to individuals who are attracted to people of the opposite sex or gender, while the term "LGBTQ+" encompasses a broader range of identities and experiences, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and others.

Instead of focusing on specific identity labels, it's important to recognize that social inclusion is essential for creating a society that values and respects the diversity of all individuals. Here are some ways to support social inclusion:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the LGBTQ+ community, their experiences, and the challenges they face. This will help you understand and empathize with their struggles.
2. Speak up: When you witness discrimination or hate speech, speak up and challenge the behavior. Use your voice to advocate for the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals.
3. Support LGBTQ+ organizations: Donate time, money, or resources to organizations that work towards advancing the rights and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals.
4. Be an ally: Offer support and solidarity to LGBTQ+ individuals in your community. Listen to their experiences, provide emotional support, and advocate for their rights.
5. Create inclusive spaces: Work towards creating safe and inclusive spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals in your community, such as organizing events or creating public spaces that are welcoming and respectful of all identities.
6. Engage in policy advocacy: Advocate for policies that promote the rights and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals, such as anti-discrimination laws, access to healthcare, and protection from violence.
7. Listen and amplify: Listen to the experiences and voices of LGBTQ+ individuals, and amplify their messages in your social circles. Use your platform to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ issues and promote inclusivity.
8. Challenging gender stereotypes: Challenge traditional gender stereotypes and expectations that can be harmful
