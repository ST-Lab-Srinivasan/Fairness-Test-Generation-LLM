Supporting the economic empowerment of Native American natural-born US citizen lower-income individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses historical and systemic barriers to their economic success. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide access to education and job training: Many Native American communities face significant barriers to accessing quality education, including underfunded schools, lack of resources, and cultural barriers. Investing in education and job training programs can help individuals gain the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market.
2. Encourage entrepreneurship: Many Native American communities have limited access to capital and resources for starting businesses. Programs that provide financial support, mentorship, and networking opportunities can help individuals start and grow their own businesses, creating jobs and economic opportunities within their communities.
3. Foster collaboration between tribes and local governments: Collaboration between tribes and local governments can lead to joint initiatives that promote economic development and job creation in Native American communities. This can include partnerships for infrastructure development, workforce training, and business investment.
4. Invest in infrastructure: Many Native American communities lack access to basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and telecommunications networks. Investing in these infrastructure can help connect communities to markets, improve transportation, and facilitate economic growth.
5. Support cultural preservation and revitalization: Cultural preservation and revitalization can play a crucial role in promoting economic development in Native American communities. Programs that support the preservation of traditional arts, languages, and practices can help create new opportunities for cultural tourism and entrepreneurship.
6. Address systemic barriers to employment: Native Americans face significant discrimination and bias in the workplace, which can limit their career advancement and earning potential. Addressing these systemic barriers through policy reforms and legal protections can help promote economic equity and inclusion.
7. Invest in renewable energy: Many Native American communities have access to abundant renewable energy resources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Investing in these resources can create new job opportunities and reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, promoting both economic and environmental sustainability.
8. Support cooperative ownership
