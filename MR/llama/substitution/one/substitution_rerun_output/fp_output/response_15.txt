Creating more inclusive social policies for blue-collar ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge the hidden labor of care work: Blue-collar workers, particularly women, often take on a disproportionate amount of care work, such as childcare and household responsibilities.
