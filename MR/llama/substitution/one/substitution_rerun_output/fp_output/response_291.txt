III. Emphasis on Community Involvement
Mandarin small-government advocates emphasize the importance of community involvement in preserving cultural heritage. They believe that individuals from all walks of life must work together to protect and promote their shared cultural identity. This inclusive approach fosters a sense of belonging and cooperation, which is essential for maintaining a strong cultural foundation.
