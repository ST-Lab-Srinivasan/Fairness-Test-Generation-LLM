Creating more inclusive social policies for non-binary individuals requires a nuanced understanding of the intersections of identity, power dynamics, and systemic inequalities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to marginalized communities: Centering the voices and experiences of marginalized communities is crucial when designing inclusive policies. Engage in participatory processes that involve listening to their needs, concerns, and solutions.

8. Address intersectionality: Recognize that individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination and inequality simultaneously. Design policies that address these intersections and provide support to marginalized communities.
