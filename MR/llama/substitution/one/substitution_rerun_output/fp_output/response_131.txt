Creating more inclusive community events for ex-military low-earning people requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions on how to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Identify and address accessibility barriers: Ensure that your event location is wheelchair-friendly, has accessible restrooms, and is located near public transportation stops or has adequate parking for those with mobility issues. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Offer financial support: Consider offering financial assistance to attendees who may struggle to afford event-related costs, such as childcare, transportation, or admission fees. You could also offer free or discounted tickets to ex-military individuals and their families.

4. Provide a safe space for attendees: Create a comfortable and welcoming environment for attendees, particularly those who may have experienced trauma or stress during their military service. Offer resources such as mental health professionals, counseling services, or peer support groups to help attendees navigate any challenges they may be facing.
5. Involve ex-military individuals in the planning process: Engage ex-military individuals in the event planning process by soliciting feedback, suggestions, and ideas for the event. This can help ensure that the event meets the needs and expectations of the ex-military community.
