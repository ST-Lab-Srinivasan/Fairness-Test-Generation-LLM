Here are some strategies that can help make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning and execution of cultural celebrations involve a diversity of perspectives, including those of individuals from marginalized communities. This can help ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of all members of society.
