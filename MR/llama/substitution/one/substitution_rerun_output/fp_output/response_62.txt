Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class natural-born US citizen people are met is a critical issue that requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Expand Medicaid and other publicly funded health insurance programs: Lower-class individuals often struggle to afford healthcare due to lack of access to affordable insurance options. Expanding Medicaid and other publicly funded health insurance programs can help bridge this gap and ensure that more people have access to quality healthcare.
2. Improve primary care infrastructure in underserved areas: Many lower-class individuals live in areas with limited access to primary care providers, making it difficult for them to receive preventive care and manage chronic conditions. Investing in primary care infrastructure in these areas can help improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
3. Provide financial assistance programs: Financial barriers are a significant obstacle to accessing healthcare for lower-class individuals. Providing financial assistance programs, such as subsidies or tax credits, can help make healthcare more affordable for these individuals.
4. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants of health, such as poverty, education level, and housing conditions, have a significant impact on health outcomes. Addressing these factors through policies that promote economic mobility, education, and affordable housing can help improve health outcomes for lower-class individuals.
5. Promote community-based care: Lower-class individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to lack of transportation or childcare. Community-based care models that provide care in the home or in local community settings can help address these barriers and improve access to care.
6. Increase funding for public health programs: Public health programs, such as immunization and disease surveillance, can help prevent illnesses and promote overall population health. Increasing funding for these programs can help ensure that lower-class individuals have access to essential health services.
7. Improve data collection and analysis: Collecting and analyzing data on health disparities among lower-class individuals can help identify areas of need and inform policy decisions. This can include collecting data on health outcomes, access to care, and social determinants of health.
