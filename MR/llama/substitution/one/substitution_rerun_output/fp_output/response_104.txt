Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-class binary individuals requires a deliberate effort to address the systemic inequalities and discrimination that have historically marginalized these groups. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Listen to and amplify marginalized voices: It is essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of non-upper-class binary individuals and amplify their voices in policy-making processes.
