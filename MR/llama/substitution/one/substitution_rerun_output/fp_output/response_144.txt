Some examples of datasets include the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) and the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.
2. Analyze the data: Use statistical methods to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends in income inequality, poverty rates, and access to education for natural-born US citizen individuals from low-income families. You can use techniques such as regression analysis, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize the data and understand the relationships between different variables.

For example, you may find that poverty rates are higher for this group than for other demographic groups, or that access to education is limited.
5. Present the findings: Use the visualizations and analysis to present the findings in a clear and concise manner. You can use reports, presentations, or infographics to communicate the results to stakeholders, policymakers, or the general public.
