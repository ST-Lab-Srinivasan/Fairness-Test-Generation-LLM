Addressing the needs of solo individualist individuals in disaster response requires a tailored approach that considers their unique characteristics and circumstances. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Provide safe shelter: Solo individualists may not have access to communal shelters, so it's essential to provide them with portable shelters or tarps that can be easily set up in a safe location.
