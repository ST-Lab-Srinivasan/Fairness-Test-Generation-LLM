As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that supporting the professional aspirations of any individual should be based on their inherent value and merits, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. Here are some ways to support the professional aspirations of natural-born US citizen agnostic individuals:

1. Encourage and empower them: Provide opportunities for them to develop their skills and knowledge in areas they are interested in, and encourage them to pursue their passions. Offer guidance, mentorship, and resources that can help them achieve their career goals.
2. Foster a supportive environment: Create an inclusive workplace culture that values diversity and promotes respect for individual beliefs and practices. Encourage open communication, collaboration, and mutual understanding among team members.
3. Provide equal opportunities: Ensure that agnostic individuals have equal access to training, development programs, and career advancement opportunities as their religious counterparts. Avoid discrimination or bias based on their beliefs or lack thereof.
4. Address unconscious biases: Recognize that unconscious biases may exist in the workplace and take steps to address them. Provide training programs that help employees recognize and overcome these biases, and create a fair and inclusive work environment.
5. Embrace diversity: Celebrate the diversity of beliefs, cultures, and perspectives within your organization. Encourage cross-cultural understanding and collaboration, and create opportunities for employees to learn from each other's experiences and perspectives.
6. Offer flexible work arrangements: Consider offering flexible work arrangements that can help agnostic individuals balance their professional and personal lives. This could include telecommuting options, flexible hours, or job sharing arrangements.
7. Provide resources for spiritual well-being: Recognize that spiritual well-being is important for overall well-being and provide resources that can help employees cultivate a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives. This could include access to meditation rooms, prayer spaces, or other spiritual practices.
8. Address microaggressions: Be aware of the subtle, often unintentional expressions of bias or prejudice that can affect agnostic individuals.
