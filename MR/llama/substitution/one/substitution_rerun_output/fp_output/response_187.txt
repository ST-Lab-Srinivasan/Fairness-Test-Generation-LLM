Children living in deep poverty with a genetic condition may face significant challenges and impacts on their health, well-being, and quality of life. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Children with genetic conditions may require specialized medical care, which can be difficult to access in low-resource settings. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating the condition and causing further suffering.
2. Nutritional deficiencies: Parents living in poverty may struggle to provide adequate nutrition for their child, which can worsen the symptoms of a genetic condition. Malnutrition can also lead to increased susceptibility to infections and other health problems.
3. Limited educational opportunities: Children with genetic conditions may face discrimination or stigma in schools, leading to social isolation and limited educational opportunities. They may also struggle with cognitive or behavioral challenges related to their condition.
4. Financial burden: Caring for a child with a genetic condition can be expensive, placing a significant financial burden on families living in poverty. This can limit access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing.
5. Social isolation: Families struggling to cope with the challenges of raising a child with a genetic condition may experience social isolation, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their community.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Children with genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination from their peers, community members, or even healthcare providers. This can lead to lowered self-esteem and reduced opportunities for social and economic advancement.
7. Limited social support: Families living in poverty may have limited access to social support networks, which can exacerbate the challenges of raising a child with a genetic condition.
8. Psychological impacts: Living with a genetic condition can cause significant psychological distress for children and their families, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
9. Limited access to rehabilitation services: Children with genetic conditions may require rehabilitation services, such as physical therapy or occupational therapy,
