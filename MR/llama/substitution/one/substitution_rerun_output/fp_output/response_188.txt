Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of children growing up in lower-middle-income countries. These conditions can affect a child's physical, mental, and social development, leading to various challenges and limitations. Here are some of the common impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of child lower-middle-income people:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Children with genetic conditions often face barriers in accessing proper medical care, including diagnosis, treatment, and management. This can result from a lack of specialized healthcare facilities, limited financial resources, or cultural beliefs that may hinder seeking medical help.

This can affect their mental health and well-being, particularly if they are unable to participate in social activities or interact with their peers.
3. Limited educational opportunities: Genetic conditions can impact a child's ability to learn and participate in educational activities, leading to limited academic progress and decreased opportunities for future success. This can be particularly challenging in lower-middle-income countries where access to quality education may be limited.
