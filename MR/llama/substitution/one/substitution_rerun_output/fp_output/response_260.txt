The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents with moderate disabilities can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Social isolation: People with moderate disabilities may face barriers in social interactions, such as difficulty communicating or participating in community activities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can negatively impact mental health and overall well-being.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Depending on the nature and severity of their disability, individuals with moderate disabilities may face barriers in accessing educational opportunities or finding employment. This can limit their ability to achieve their full potential and lead a fulfilling life.
3. Financial challenges: Moderate disabilities can result in increased healthcare costs, assistive technology expenses, and other related expenditures. These financial burdens can impact an individual's quality of life and limit their ability to save for the future or invest in their well-being.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, many people with disabilities still face stigma and discrimination in society. This can lead to feelings of low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety, which can significantly impact mental health and overall quality of life.
5. Limited access to transportation: Individuals with moderate disabilities may encounter difficulties when it comes to using public transportation, such as buses or trains, due to inaccessible infrastructure or lack of accommodations. This can limit their ability to travel independently and participate in community activities.
6. Difficulty with daily living tasks: Moderate disabilities can impact an individual's ability to perform daily living tasks, such as bathing, dressing, or grooming. This can result in a loss of independence and reliance on family members or caregivers for assistance.
7. Limited access to healthcare: Individuals with moderate disabilities may face barriers when trying to access healthcare services due to lack of accessible facilities or discrimination by healthcare providers. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, which can negatively impact overall health outcomes.
8. Impact on family dynamics: Living with a moderate disability can have a significant impact on the entire family
