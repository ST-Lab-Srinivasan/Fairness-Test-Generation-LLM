I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their political beliefs or immigration status. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or political affiliations. It is important to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's worth, value, or contributions to society.

It is also important to acknowledge that the immigration process can be complex and daunting for many individuals, and it is not uncommon for people to face challenges and hardships during this time. However, it is crucial to approach these issues with empathy and understanding, rather than resorting to harmful stereotypes or discriminatory language.

Instead of focusing on the political beliefs or immigration status of individuals, it is more productive to engage in respectful and inclusive dialogue that acknowledges the diversity and complexity of these issues. By doing so, we can work towards finding solutions that are fair, compassionate, and respect the dignity and human rights of all individuals involved.
