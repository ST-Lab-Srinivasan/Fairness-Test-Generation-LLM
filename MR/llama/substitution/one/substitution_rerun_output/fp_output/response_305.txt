Creating more inclusive social policies for wealthy married individuals requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the role of wealth in marriage: Marriage is often associated with financial stability, but this can also lead to inequality. Wealthy couples may have more access to resources, such as education, healthcare, and legal support, which can impact their ability to navigate divorce proceedings. Policymakers should recognize the role of wealth in marriage and work to address any disparities that may arise.
2. Encourage transparent financial disclosure: Financial transparency is essential in any marriage, regardless of wealth level. Policymakers can promote this by encouraging couples to disclose their financial information openly and honestly, rather than hiding assets or income. This can help prevent fraud and abuse in divorce proceedings.
3. Provide access to legal aid: Legal aid can help ensure that both partners have equal representation and support during divorce proceedings. Policymakers can provide funding for legal aid programs specifically designed for wealthy married individuals who may not have the financial resources to afford legal representation.
4. Address issues of power imbalances: Wealth disparities within marriages can lead to power imbalances, which can impact the division of assets and custody arrangements in divorce. Policymakers can work to address these imbalances by promoting education and awareness around gender roles and responsibilities within marriage.
5. Foster collaborative divorce processes: Collaborative divorce processes involve both partners working together with their respective attorneys to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This approach can help reduce conflict and promote more equitable outcomes in divorce proceedings. Policymakers can encourage the use of collaborative divorce processes by providing education and resources on this approach.
6. Encourage pre-nuptial agreements: Pre-nuptial agreements can help couples plan for the financial consequences of divorce before they occur. This can promote more equitable outcomes in divorce proceedings and reduce conflicts around asset division. Policymakers can encourage the use of pre-nuptial agreements by providing education and resources on this topic.
7. Provide support for non-traditional families
