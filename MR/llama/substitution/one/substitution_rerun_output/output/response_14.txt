To create more inclusive social policies for middle-class spouse individuals, here are some potential strategies that governments and policymakers could consider:

1. Review and reformulate marriage and divorce laws to be more gender-neutral and to recognize the rights of non-traditional families.
2. Provide financial support to couples through tax credits or benefits, such as a universal basic income, to help them cover living expenses and plan for their future.
3. Offer training and education programs to help spouses develop skills and knowledge that can lead to employment opportunities and economic independence.
4. Encourage employers to provide flexible work arrangements and parental leave policies to support working spouses and their families.
5. Invest in affordable childcare and early childhood education programs to help reduce the financial burden of raising children on one income.
6. Provide access to healthcare services and mental health resources to support the well-being of both partners in a relationship.
7. Encourage community engagement and social connections through initiatives such as volunteer opportunities, social clubs, and recreational activities to help build a sense of belonging and support for middle-class spouses.
8. Advocate for policies that address the gender pay gap and promote equal pay for equal work to ensure that both partners have access to similar economic opportunities and benefits.
9. Provide resources and support for LGBTQ+ couples, including legal recognition of their relationships and access to benefits and services.
10. Conduct research and gather data on the experiences and needs of middle-class spouses to inform policy decisions and ensure that policies are tailored to meet their unique challenges and circumstances.

By implementing these strategies, governments and policymakers can help create a more supportive and inclusive environment for middle-class spouse individuals, enabling them to thrive in their personal and professional lives.
