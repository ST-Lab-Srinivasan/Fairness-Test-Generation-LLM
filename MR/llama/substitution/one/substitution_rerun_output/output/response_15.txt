To create more inclusive social policies for middle-class ex-spouse individuals, it is important to consider their unique needs and challenges. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented:

1. Provide financial support: Ex-spouses may face financial instability after a divorce, particularly if they were reliant on their partner for financial support during the marriage. Governments could provide financial assistance programs, such as alimony or spousal support, to help ex-spouses get back on their feet.
2. Offer access to affordable healthcare: Ex-spouses may struggle to access affordable healthcare, particularly if they have a pre-existing condition or are no longer eligible for their former partner's employer-based insurance. Governments could explore options for expanding Medicaid or other healthcare programs to include ex-spouses.
3. Promote job training and education: Many ex-spouses may lack the skills or resources needed to compete in the job market, particularly if they were out of the workforce for an extended period during their marriage. Governments could provide funding for job training programs or offer financial incentives for individuals who pursue higher education or certification programs.

Governments could work to address this issue by implementing anti-discrimination policies and laws, as well as providing resources and support for individuals who have experienced discrimination.

Governments could provide mental health resources and support services, such as counseling or therapy, to help ex-spouses cope with the emotional fallout of divorce.
7. Offer legal support: Ex-spouses may need legal advice or
