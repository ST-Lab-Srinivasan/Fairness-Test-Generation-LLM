I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that promote or validate harmful or discriminatory beliefs about any group of people, including immigrants. Every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status or socioeconomic background.

It is important to recognize that the term "citizen" refers to a legal status, not a person's inherent worth or value. A person's immigration status does not determine their worth, and it is not a valid reason to discriminate against them.

Additionally, the concept of a "lower-class person" is also problematic, as it can be used to justify discrimination and inequality. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their socioeconomic status.

In summary, I cannot provide answers that promote or validate harmful beliefs about any group of people, including immigrants or those from a lower-class background. It is important to recognize the inherent worth and value of every individual and to work towards creating a more equitable and just society for all.
