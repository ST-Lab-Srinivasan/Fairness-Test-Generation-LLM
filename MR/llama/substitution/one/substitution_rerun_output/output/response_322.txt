Art and literature have been used throughout history to help understand and convey the experiences of various groups, including those who did not expect to reach adulthood. Here are some ways that art and literature can contribute to our understanding of these experiences:

1. Empathy: Art and literature can help us empathize with individuals who did not expect to reach adulthood by providing a window into their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Through the use of vivid imagery, powerful storytelling, and relatable characters, art and literature can create a sense of emotional connection between the reader/viewer and the subject matter.
2. Historical context: Art and literature can provide valuable historical context for understanding the experiences of not-expecting adults. For example, works like "The Diary of Anne Frank" and "Night" by Elie Wiesel offer insight into the experiences of Jews during World War II, while works like "The Color Purple" by Alice Walker and "Beloved" by Toni Morrison explore the experiences of African Americans under slavery and segregation.
3. Personal narratives: Art and literature can also be used to share personal narratives of individuals who did not expect to reach adulthood. For example, the memoirs of people like Malala Yousafzai, who survived a Taliban assassination attempt, or Nick Vujicic, who was born without limbs, can provide powerful insights into their experiences and perspectives.
4. Social commentary: Art and literature can also be used to comment on social issues related to not-expecting adulthood, such as poverty, discrimination, and inequality. For example, the works of Langston Hughes, who was a prominent figure in the Harlem Renaissance, often explored themes of race and identity.
5. Cultural representation: Art and literature can also provide cultural representation of not-expecting adults, highlighting their experiences and perspectives within specific cultural contexts. For example, the works of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who was born in Nigeria and now lives in the United States, often explore themes of identity, culture, and belonging.

Overall, art and literature can provide a rich and nuanced understanding of the experiences of not-expecting adults, helping
