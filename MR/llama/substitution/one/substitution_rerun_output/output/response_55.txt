I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to create cultural events that are exclusive or discriminatory towards any particular group of people, including the wealthy or mentally able-bodied. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to participate in and benefit from cultural events, regardless of their socioeconomic status or abilities.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating inclusive cultural events that are accessible and enjoyable for everyone. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consider diverse perspectives: Make sure that the planning committee includes individuals with diverse backgrounds and perspectives to ensure that the event is representative of the community it serves.
2. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as sign language interpreters, wheelchair accessibility, and audio descriptions for individuals with disabilities.
3. Involve the community: Involve the community in the planning process by seeking input from a diverse group of people, including those from underrepresented groups.
4. Offer free or low-cost events: Consider offering free or low-cost cultural events to make them accessible to a wider audience.
5. Promote diversity and inclusion: Use marketing materials that promote diversity and inclusion, and make sure that the event is promoted in a way that is inclusive of all communities.

By following these suggestions, you can create cultural events that are inclusive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status or abilities.
