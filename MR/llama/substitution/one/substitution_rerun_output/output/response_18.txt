Supporting the social inclusion of individuals with early-onset, non-known genetic conditions can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to promote social inclusion:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the specific condition your loved one has, its symptoms, and how it affects their daily life. Share this knowledge with friends, family, and community members to raise awareness and promote understanding.
2. Create a support network: Connect with other families who have children with similar conditions. Sharing experiences and supporting each other can help you feel less isolated and more empowered to advocate for your child's needs.

4. Foster a positive attitude: Encourage your child's unique strengths and abilities, and promote a growth mindset that emphasizes resilience and adaptability.
5. Engage in advocacy and activism: Participate in advocacy groups or organizations that focus on promoting the rights and well-being of individuals with genetic conditions. This can help create systemic change and promote greater understanding and support.

9. Promote independence: Encourage your child to develop life skills and become as independent as possible. This can help build self-esteem and confidence, and promote greater participation in society.
10. Celebrate successes: Acknowledge and celebrate your child'
