There are several ways to ensure that the educational needs of lower-class child individuals are met:

1. Provide access to quality education: Ensure that lower-class children have access to well-resourced schools with experienced teachers, up-to-date curricula, and adequate facilities. This can be achieved through policies such as increasing government funding for public education, providing financial aid to families who cannot afford it, or establishing community-based programs that provide free or low-cost education.
2. Address socio-economic disparities: Socio-economic factors can significantly impact a child's ability to learn and succeed in school. Addressing these disparities through policies such as poverty reduction programs, job training for parents, and community development initiatives can help level the playing field for lower-class children.
3. Foster inclusive learning environments: Create learning environments that are welcoming and inclusive for all students, regardless of their socio-economic background. This can be achieved through anti-bias training for teachers, cultural competence programs, and creating safe and supportive school communities.
4. Provide additional support services: Offer additional support services such as tutoring, mentoring, and counseling to help lower-class children who may be struggling academically or emotionally. These services can help bridge the gap between lower-class children and their more affluent peers.
5. Advocate for policies that benefit lower-class children: Advocate for policies that benefit lower-class children, such as increased funding for public education, free or affordable early childhood education, and policies that address the systemic inequalities faced by lower-class families.
6. Engage with the community: Work with local communities to identify the specific educational needs of lower-class children and develop targeted interventions to address those needs. This can involve collaborating with community organizations, conducting surveys or focus groups, and engaging with parents and guardians to better understand their concerns and priorities.
7. Provide resources for families: Offer resources such as parenting workshops, educational materials, and other support services to help lower-class families navigate the education system and provide their children with the best possible opportunities.
8. Address language barriers: For lower-class children who
