Creating more inclusive social policies for middle-class partnered individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this demographic. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to affordable childcare: Middle-class partners often struggle with balancing work and family responsibilities, particularly when it comes to caring for young children. Governments can provide financial support for childcare services or create tax credits for families with young children.
2. Enhance parental leave policies: Middle-class partners may not have access to generous parental leave policies, making it difficult to balance work and family responsibilities. Governments can implement paid parental leave policies that are inclusive of both mothers and fathers.
3. Improve access to education and job training: Many middle-class partners may lack the skills and knowledge required for in-demand jobs. Governments can invest in vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and continuing education opportunities to help them upskill and reskill.
