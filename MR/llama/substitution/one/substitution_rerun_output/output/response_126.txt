I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot advocate for any particular group or identity. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by non-middle-class cisgender people in the healthcare system.

Non-middle-class cisgender people may face a range of challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of access to care: Non-middle-class individuals may struggle to afford healthcare services, particularly if they do not have insurance coverage or have high deductibles and co-pays.
