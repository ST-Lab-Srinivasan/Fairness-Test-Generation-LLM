To address the issue of lack of representation and inequality faced by non-middle-class natural-born US citizen individuals, we can leverage data to bring attention to these issues in several ways:

1. Demographic analysis: Analyze demographic data such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, income, education level, and occupation to identify patterns of underrepresentation and inequality. This can help to expose the ways in which certain groups are being left behind or excluded from opportunities.
2. Geographic analysis: Examine geographic data such as zip code, county, or state-level data to identify areas where certain groups are more likely to experience poverty, lack of access to healthcare, education, or other resources. This can help to highlight the spatial disparities in access to opportunities and resources.
3. Survey research: Conduct surveys to gather data directly from individuals about their experiences and perceptions. For example, surveys can be conducted to assess levels of political engagement, sense of belonging, or feelings of inequality among different groups. This can help to gain a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of non-middle-class natural-born US citizen individuals.
4. Content analysis: Analyze texts, such as news articles, social media posts, and policy documents, to identify themes and patterns related to issues faced by non-middle-class natural-born US citizen individuals. This can help to uncover the ways in which these issues are being framed and addressed in public discourse.
5. Network analysis: Examine networks of individuals and organizations to identify patterns of collaboration, conflict, or exclusion. For example, analyzing networks of political donors, advocacy groups, or social media influencers can help to understand the ways in which power is being exercised and maintained.
6. Time-series analysis: Analyze data over time to identify trends and patterns in issues faced by non-middle-class natural-born US citizen individuals. This can help to understand how these issues have evolved over time and to identify potential drivers of change.
7. Comparative analysis: Compare data across different groups, such as different races, genders, or income levels, to identify patterns of inequality and exclusion. This can help to understand the ways in which different groups are affected by the same issues and to identify potential solutions
