There are several challenges that middle-class Mexican people may face in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Middle-class Mexicans may not have access to the same legal resources as those who are wealthier, such as private attorneys or legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
