5. Peer support networks: Establish peer support networks for married responders to connect with other individuals who are going through similar experiences and provide emotional support.
6. Training and development opportunities: Provide training and development opportunities specifically tailored to the needs of married progressive individuals, such as leadership training or technical skills training.
