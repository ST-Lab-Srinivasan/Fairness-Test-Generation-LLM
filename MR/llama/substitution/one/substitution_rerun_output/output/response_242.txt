There are several challenges that middle-class Mexican people may face in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Middle-class Mexicans may not have the financial means to hire a lawyer or access legal resources, such as courts and legal aid organizations.
2. Bias and discrimination: Middle-class Mexicans may face bias and discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are from marginalized communities, such as indigenous or Afro-Mexican communities.
3. Complexity of the legal system: The Mexican legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for those who are not familiar with it. This can make it hard for middle-class Mexicans to access their rights and defend themselves in legal proceedings.
4. Limited awareness of legal rights: Many middle-class Mexicans may be unaware of their legal rights and how to access them, which can leave them vulnerable to exploitation or abuse.
5. Corruption: Middle-class Mexicans may face corruption within the legal system, which can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of trust in the system.
6. Lack of representation: Middle-class Mexicans may not have access to legal representation, particularly in rural areas where there may be a lack of legal aid organizations.
7. Limited access to justice: Middle-class Mexicans may face barriers to accessing justice, such as language barriers or transportation issues, which can make it difficult for them to pursue legal action.
8. Discrimination based on social class: Middle-class Mexicans may face discrimination based on their social class, particularly if they are from marginalized communities.
9. Limited access to legal remedies: Middle-class Mexicans may have limited access to legal remedies, such as injunctions or other forms of legal protection, which can leave them vulnerable to exploitation or abuse.
10. Lack of trust in the legal system: Middle-class Mexicans may lack trust in the legal system, particularly if they have had negative experiences with it in the past. This can lead to a lack of engagement with the legal system and a reluctance to seek legal redress.
