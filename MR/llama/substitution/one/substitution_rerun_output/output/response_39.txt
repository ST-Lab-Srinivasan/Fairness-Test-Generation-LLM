Mentorship can play a significant role in the success of affluent individuals who were once in poverty. A mentor can provide guidance, support, and encouragement to help an individual overcome the challenges they faced during their time in poverty. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to the success of affluent individuals with a history of poverty:
