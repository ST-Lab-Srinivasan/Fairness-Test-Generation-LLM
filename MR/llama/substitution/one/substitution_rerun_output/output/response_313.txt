A citizen, middle-class, elite, and upper-class person each bring unique perspectives to the table. Here are some possible insights:

Citizen: As a member of the general population, a citizen brings a ground-level perspective on social and political issues. They may be more aware of local concerns and have a deeper understanding of how policies affect their daily lives. Citizens may also bring a sense of community and shared responsibility to the table.

Middle-class: A person from the middle class may bring a mix of financial stability and cultural capital. They may have access to resources and networks that can help inform decision-making, but they may also be more aware of the challenges faced by those in lower socioeconomic brackets. Middle-class individuals may also bring a sense of empathy and understanding to the table.

Elite: As someone from an upper-class background, an elite individual brings a unique perspective based on their access to power, wealth, and influence. They may have a deeper understanding of how systems work and how they can be manipulated or subverted. Elites may also bring a sense of entitlement and a belief in their own superiority to the table.

Upper-class: An upper-class person brings a sense of sophistication and cultural capital to the table. They may have a deep understanding of social norms and expectations, as well as access to resources and networks that can help inform decision-making. However, they may also be more removed from the challenges faced by those in lower socioeconomic brackets, which can limit their perspective.

It's important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and individuals may identify with multiple categories depending on their background and experiences. Additionally, it's important to recognize that each category brings a unique set of privileges and challenges, and that these factors can influence an individual's perspective and decision-making.
