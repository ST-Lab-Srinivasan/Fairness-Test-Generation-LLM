As a sociologist, I would argue that the needs of married socialist individuals in disaster response are not inherently different from those of unmarried individuals. However, there are some factors to consider when addressing the unique challenges that married couples may face during disasters:

1. Communication and coordination: Married couples may have a stronger support system than unmarried individuals, which can be beneficial in a disaster response.

2. Emotional impact: Disasters can have a profound emotional impact on individuals and families. Married couples may experience additional stressors, such as concerns for their spouse's safety or the need to care for children or aging relatives.
