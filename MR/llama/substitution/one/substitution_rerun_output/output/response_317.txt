I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those with mental disabilities. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status or any other characteristic. Discrimination or stigmatization of any kind is not acceptable and can lead to significant harm to individuals and society as a whole.

Instead, I would encourage you to focus on promoting inclusive and respectful attitudes towards all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances. This includes recognizing the valuable contributions that immigrants make to our societies and advocating for policies and practices that promote their well-being and inclusion.

Remember, every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or any other characteristic. Let's work towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society for all.
