To create more inclusive cultural events for able-bodied late pregnancy individuals, consider the following strategies:

1. Accessibility features: Ensure that the event venue is wheelchair accessible and has ample parking, restrooms, and seating areas. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Accommodate different abilities: Offer flexible seating options, such as raised platforms or wheelchair-accessible seating, to accommodate attendees with mobility challenges. Provide materials in various formats, including Braille, large print, or audio, for attendees who have visual or cognitive impairments.
3. Inclusive programming: Develop a diverse and inclusive program that caters to different interests and abilities. Offer workshops, performances, or exhibitions that cater to various disability identities, such as wheelchair dancing, sign language classes, or tactile art exhibitions.
4. Representation matters: Ensure that the event's marketing materials, including flyers, posters, and social media campaigns, feature images of people with disabilities in leading roles. This can help promote a more inclusive culture and challenge ableism.
5. Involve disabled community members: Collaborate with disabled community members in the planning and execution of the event. This can help ensure that the event is responsive to the needs of diverse attendees and foster a sense of ownership and belonging.
6. Provide support services: Offer support services, such as personal assistants or service animals, to attendees who may need them to fully participate in the event. Make sure these services are accessible and easily available throughout the event.
7. Educate staff and volunteers: Train staff and volunteers on disability etiquette and inclusive practices to ensure that attendees feel welcome and respected. Provide resources and support for staff and volunteers to address any questions or concerns they may have.
8. Continuous improvement: Regularly solicit feedback from attendees, staff, and volunteers to identify areas of improvement and make necessary adjustments to create a more inclusive event experience.
