There are several ways to create more inclusive social policies for middle-class unmarried individuals. Here are some possible strategies:

1. Addressing the gender pay gap: Unmarried women, particularly those without children, often face significant barriers to economic security. Policies aimed at closing the gender pay gap, such as equal pay for equal work and protections against discrimination based on gender, can help address this issue.
2. Improving access to affordable housing: Middle-class unmarried individuals may struggle with high housing costs, particularly in urban areas. Policies that promote affordable housing options, such as rent control or subsidized housing, can help make housing more affordable for these individuals.
3. Enhancing support for education and job training: Unmarried middle-class individuals may face barriers to advancing their careers due to a lack of access to quality education and job training opportunities. Policies that provide financial assistance for education and job training, as well as those that promote lifelong learning and skill development, can help level the playing field.
4. Strengthening social safety nets: Unmarried middle-class individuals may face economic insecurity due to a lack of access to social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance or disability benefits. Policies that expand access to these programs can help provide a financial cushion for these individuals during times of need.
5. Promoting flexible work arrangements: Unmarried middle-class individuals may face challenges balancing work and personal responsibilities due to inflexible work schedules or lack of paid leave. Policies that promote flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or flexible hours, can help address this issue.
6. Addressing discrimination and stigma: Unmarried middle-class individuals may face social stigma or discrimination based on their marital status. Policies that promote inclusivity and respect for diversity can help address these issues.
7.
