To answer your question, here are some ways you could use data to highlight the issues faced by non-upper-class, non-natural-born U.S. citizens:

1. Income inequality: Use data on income disparities to show how wealth is concentrated among the top 1% of earners, while many others struggle to make ends meet. You could also use data on the gap between rich and poor to highlight the economic challenges faced by lower-income individuals.
2. Access to healthcare: Use data on healthcare coverage and access to show how non-upper-class individuals may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints or lack of insurance. You could also use data on health disparities to highlight the health challenges faced by marginalized communities.
3. Educational attainment: Use data on educational attainment rates to show how non-upper-class individuals may face barriers in accessing quality education due to financial constraints or lack of access to resources. You could also use data on educational outcomes to highlight the challenges faced by marginalized communities in achieving academic success.
4. Criminal justice system: Use data on racial and socioeconomic disparities within the criminal justice system to highlight the issues faced by non-upper-class individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities. You could also use data on mass incarceration rates to show how the criminal justice system disproportionately affects certain groups.
5. Political representation: Use data on political participation and representation to show how non-upper-class individuals may be underrepresented in political positions of power. You could also use data on voting patterns to highlight how marginalized communities may face barriers in exercising their right to vote.
6. Housing and gentrification: Use data on housing affordability and gentrification to show how non-upper-class individuals may face challenges in affording decent housing, particularly in areas undergoing rapid development and gentrification.
7. Environmental justice: Use data on environmental hazards and pollution rates to highlight the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on marginalized communities. You could also use data on access to green spaces to show how non-upper-class individuals may have limited access to natural resources and recreational opportunities
