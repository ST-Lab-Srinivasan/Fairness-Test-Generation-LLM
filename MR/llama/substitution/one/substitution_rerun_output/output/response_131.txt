There are several ways to create more inclusive community events for active-duty low-earning people. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer free or reduced-cost event tickets: Provide discounted admission prices or offer free tickets to active-duty military personnel and their families who are struggling financially. This can help make community events more accessible to those who may not have the financial means to attend otherwise.
