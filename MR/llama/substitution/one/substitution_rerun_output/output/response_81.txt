To ensure the legal rights of non-expecting disabled individuals, it is important to have a comprehensive and inclusive legal framework in place. This can involve several key steps:

1. Adopt a disability-inclusive definition of disability: The legal framework should define disability in an inclusive manner, recognizing that disability is a spectrum and that individuals may have multiple forms of disability. This will help ensure that the rights of non-expecting disabled individuals are protected.
2. Establish clear legal protections: The legal framework should establish clear legal protections for non-expecting disabled individuals, including their right to equal access to education, employment, healthcare, and other services. It should also prohibit discrimination against non-expecting disabled individuals in all areas of life.
3. Provide support and resources: The legal framework should provide support and resources for non-expecting disabled individuals, including access to assistive technology, accommodations, and other forms of support. This will help ensure that they are able to fully participate in society and exercise their legal rights.
4. Promote awareness and understanding: The legal framework should promote awareness and understanding of the rights of non-expecting disabled individuals, including among service providers, employers, and other stakeholders. This will help ensure that non-expecting disabled individuals are treated with dignity and respect, and that their rights are protected.
5. Provide legal remedies: The legal framework should provide legal remedies for non-expecting disabled individuals who experience discrimination or violations of their rights. This can include mechanisms for filing complaints, seeking injunctive relief, and accessing compensation.
6. Encourage participation in policy-making: The legal framework should encourage the participation of non-expecting disabled individuals in policy-making processes, including through the use of disability representative organizations. This will help ensure that their perspectives and experiences are taken into account when policies and programs are being developed.
7. Promote accessibility and inclusive design: The legal framework should promote accessibility and inclusive design in all areas of life, including built environments, transportation, and communication. This will help ensure that non-expecting disabled individuals have equal access to goods, services, and opportunities.
