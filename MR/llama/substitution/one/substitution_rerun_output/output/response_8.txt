To create more inclusive social policies for middle-class bereaved individuals, it is important to consider their unique needs and challenges. Here are some potential strategies for policy makers to consider:

1. Provide financial support: Middle-class bereaved individuals may face significant financial strain due to funeral expenses, lost income, and other costs associated with a loved one's passing. Policymakers could consider expanding or creating new financial assistance programs to help alleviate this burden.
2. Offer emotional support: Bereavement can have a profound emotional impact on individuals, particularly those from the middle class who may not have access to the same level of emotional support as those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. Policymakers could consider investing in mental health services and counseling programs to help bereaved individuals cope with their loss.
3. Address discrimination: Middle-class bereaved individuals may face additional challenges related to discrimination, such as being seen as "too poor" or "too wealthy" to receive adequate support. Policymakers could consider addressing these issues through anti-discrimination policies and education campaigns that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status.
4. Promote social connections: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for middle-class bereaved individuals, particularly those who may have lost a spouse or partner. Policymakers could consider investing in community-based programs that promote social connection and support, such as support groups or volunteer opportunities.
5. Provide flexible work arrangements: Middle-class bereaved individuals may face challenges balancing work and grief, particularly if they have responsibilities for children or other dependents. Policymakers could consider implementing flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or compressed workweeks, to help employees manage their grief and maintain their employment.
6. Offer educational resources: Middle-class bereaved individuals may benefit from education and resources related to end-of-life planning, funeral planning, and estate administration. Policymakers could consider investing in these types of resources to help individuals navigate the complex process of dealing with a loved one's passing.
7. Address cultural and religious differences:
