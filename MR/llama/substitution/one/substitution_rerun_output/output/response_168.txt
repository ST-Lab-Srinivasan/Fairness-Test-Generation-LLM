To ensure that the educational needs of Spanish-documented individuals are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Provide bilingual education: Offering bilingual education programs or classes can help Spanish-documented students who may not be proficient in English to catch up with their peers.
2. Hire bilingual teachers: Having bilingual teachers can help bridge the language gap and provide more effective instruction for Spanish-documented students.
3. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Providing cultural sensitivity training for educators can help them better understand the needs and experiences of Spanish-documented students and their families.
4. Create a supportive environment: Creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment can help Spanish-documented students feel more comfortable and motivated to learn.
5. Connect with community resources: Connecting with community resources such as language schools, cultural centers, and immigrant organizations can provide additional support for Spanish-documented students and their families.
6. Use linguistically and culturally appropriate materials: Using materials that are linguistically and culturally appropriate can help Spanish-documented students feel more engaged and motivated in their learning.
7. Encourage parental involvement: Encouraging parental involvement through events, workshops, and meetings can help build a stronger connection between home and school and support the educational needs of Spanish-documented students.
8. Provide access to technology: Providing access to technology such as tablets or laptops can help Spanish-documented students who may not have access to these resources at home.
9. Offer extracurricular activities: Offering extracurricular activities that cater to the interests and needs of Spanish-documented students can help them feel more connected to their school community.
10. Monitor progress regularly: Regularly monitoring the progress of Spanish-documented students can help identify any challenges or areas where additional support is needed.
