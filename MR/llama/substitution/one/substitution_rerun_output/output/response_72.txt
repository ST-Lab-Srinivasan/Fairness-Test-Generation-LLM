To ensure that the educational needs of disabled permanent resident students are met, schools and educational institutions can take several steps:

1. Identify and assess the student's needs: Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the student's abilities, strengths, and challenges to determine the accommodations and support they require. This may involve consulting with the student, their parents or guardians, and other educational professionals.
2. Develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP): Create a tailored plan that outlines the student's goals, objectives, and strategies for achieving them. The IEP should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it remains relevant and effective.
3. Provide access to appropriate resources: Ensure that the student has access to necessary resources such as assistive technology devices, adaptive equipment, and additional support services. These may include speech therapy, occupational therapy, or counseling.
4. Train staff and teachers: Provide training for school staff and teachers on how to support students with disabilities, including how to use assistive technology and adaptive equipment, and how to create an inclusive learning environment.
5. Foster an inclusive culture: Encourage a culture of inclusion and respect for diversity among students, teachers, and parents. This can involve educating the broader school community about disabilities and the importance of inclusivity.
6. Monitor progress and adjust strategies as needed: Regularly review the student's progress and adjust the IEP and support strategies as necessary to ensure that their educational needs are being met.
7. Engage with parents and guardians: Keep parents and guardians informed about their child's progress and involve them in the decision-making process around their child's education. This can help build a strong partnership between home and school and ensure that the student's needs are being met.
8. Provide additional support services: Depending on the nature of the disability, schools may need to provide additional support services such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, or counseling to help the student succeed in their educational program.
9. Use technology to support learning: Consider using assistive technology devices and software to support the student's learning, such as text-to-speech software, speech-to-text software, or interactive learning
