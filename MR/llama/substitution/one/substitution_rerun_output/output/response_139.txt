Creating more inclusive recreational activities for undocumented and low-income people can be achieved through a combination of outreach, collaboration, and innovative programming. Here are some strategies that organizations and communities can consider:

For example, provide sports equipment or facilities that are accessible to people with disabilities, or offer recreational activities that are tailored to the interests and abilities of older adults.
3. Language accessibility: Provide language interpretation services during recreational activities to ensure that everyone can participate fully. Offer bilingual or multilingual staff and volunteers to support diverse communities.
