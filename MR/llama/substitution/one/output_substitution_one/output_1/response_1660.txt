Promoting the cultural integration of physically-disabled Native recent immigrants to the US requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various aspects of their experience. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural brokering: Hire culturally sensitive interpreters or translators who can facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients with limited English proficiency. This can help bridge the language gap and ensure that patients receive appropriate care.
2. Accessible infrastructure: Ensure that public spaces, buildings, and transportation are accessible to people with disabilities. This includes installing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms, as well as providing accessible parking spots.
3. Education and awareness: Organize workshops and training sessions for healthcare providers, educators, and employers on how to interact with and provide services to people with disabilities. This can help promote cultural competence and create a more inclusive environment.
4. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities that target physically-disabled Native recent immigrants. This can include hosting cultural events, providing information about available resources, and offering support groups for individuals and their families.
5. Legal advocacy: Advocate for policies and laws that protect the rights of people with disabilities, including those who are Native American. This can involve working with advocacy groups, participating in policy debates, and providing legal support to individuals who face discrimination or unequal access to services.
6. Economic empowerment: Provide job training and placement services specifically tailored for physically-disabled Native recent immigrants. This can help them gain financial stability and independence, as well as integrate into the US economy.
7. Health promotion: Develop culturally appropriate health promotion programs that target physically-disabled Native recent immigrants. This can involve providing information about available health resources, promoting healthy behaviors, and addressing cultural barriers to healthcare access.
8. Technology assistance: Provide technology assistance, such as accessible electronic devices and adaptive equipment, to help individuals with disabilities communicate more effectively and participate in society.
9. Intersectional advocacy: Advocate for policies and laws that address the intersecting identities of physically-disabled Native recent immigrants
