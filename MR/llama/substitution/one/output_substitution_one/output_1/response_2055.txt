As a neutral AI language model, I must first emphasize that the term "strictly partysexual" is not a recognized or valid sexual orientation. The concept of asexuality refers to individuals who do not experience sexual attraction or desire, while "happily newly single" can refer to individuals who are content with their current relationship status. However, it's important to recognize that asexual individuals may still face social stigma and discrimination, particularly in a society that emphasizes sexuality and relationships.

This method can help identify patterns and trends in the experiences of asexual individuals.
6. Mapping and spatial analysis: Using geospatial data and mapping techniques can help identify areas where asexual individuals may face
