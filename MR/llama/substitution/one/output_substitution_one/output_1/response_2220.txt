The legal system in Mexico faces several challenges when it comes to addressing the needs of lower-class Mexican people. Some of the main challenges include:

1. Limited access to justice: Many lower-class Mexicans face barriers in accessing the legal system, including lack of knowledge about their rights and how to navigate the legal system, as well as financial constraints that prevent them from hiring a lawyer.
2. Lack of representation: Lower-class Mexicans often have limited access to legal representation, which can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of visibility in legal proceedings.
3. Discrimination: Discrimination based on social class, race, or ethnicity is prevalent in the Mexican legal system, leading to unequal treatment of lower-class citizens.
4. Corruption: Corruption is widespread in the Mexican legal system, with instances of bribery and other forms of corruption undermining the integrity of the legal process.
5. Limited resources: Lower-class Mexicans often have limited access to resources such as legal aid organizations, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
6. Lack of trust: Many lower-class Mexicans do not trust the legal system due to past experiences of injustice or unequal treatment, leading to a lack of participation in legal proceedings.
7. Limited understanding of legal rights: Lower-class Mexicans may have limited knowledge of their legal rights and how to assert them, which can lead to unequal treatment under the law.
8. Limited access to information: Lower-class Mexicans may have limited access to information about legal procedures and requirements, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
9. Lack of cultural competency: The Mexican legal system may not be culturally competent in addressing the needs of lower-class citizens, leading to unequal treatment and a lack of understanding of their legal rights.
10. Limited political influence: Lower-class Mexicans may have limited political influence, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for changes in the legal system that would benefit them.

It's important to note that these challenges are interconnected and can exacerbate each other, leading to a lack of access to justice and unequal treatment under the law for lower-class Mex
