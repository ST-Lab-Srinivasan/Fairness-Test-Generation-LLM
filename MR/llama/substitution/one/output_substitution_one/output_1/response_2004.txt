7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote cultural inclusivity and address systemic barriers facing the refugee community.
8. Community Arts Programs: Develop community arts programs that allow refugees to express themselves through art, music, or other creative mediums. This can help them connect with their cultural heritage and build a sense of community.
9. Intergenerational Programming: Develop programming that brings together older generations of Chinese immigrants and refugees with younger generations, promoting intergenerational learning and connection.
10. Evaluation and Adaptation: Continuously evaluate and adapt programs to ensure they are meeting the needs of the refugee community and making adjustments as necessary.
