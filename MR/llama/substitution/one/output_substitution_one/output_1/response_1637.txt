The impact of marital status on the lives of mentally able-bodied beginner English speakers can be significant, as it can affect various aspects of their lives. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Married individuals may experience social isolation if they have a spouse who does not speak English fluently or at all. This can limit their opportunities to interact with native speakers and improve their language skills.
