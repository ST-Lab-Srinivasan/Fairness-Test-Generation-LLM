Creating more inclusive social policies for employed cisgender individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Ensure equal pay for equal work: One of the most important steps towards creating a more inclusive society is to ensure that all employees, regardless of their gender identity, receive equal pay for equal work. This can be achieved by conducting regular pay audits and taking corrective action when disparities are identified.
2. Provide gender-neutral benefits: Many employers offer benefits that are gendered, such as maternity leave or paternity leave. To create a more inclusive environment, consider offering gender-neutral benefits that are available to all employees, regardless of their gender identity. This could include parental leave, adoption leave, or other benefits that support employees in their personal and family responsibilities.
3. Offer flexible work arrangements: Many employed cisgender individuals face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities. To create a more inclusive environment, consider offering flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, flexible hours, or job sharing. This can help employees balance their work and personal responsibilities without feeling like they are compromising one for the other.
4. Provide access to gender-affirming healthcare: Employed cisgender individuals may face challenges accessing gender-affirming healthcare, such as hormone replacement therapy or gender confirmation surgeries. To create a more inclusive environment, consider providing access to these services through your employer-sponsored health insurance plan.
5. Create a supportive workplace culture: A supportive workplace culture can go a long way in creating a more inclusive environment for employed cisgender individuals. Consider implementing policies and practices that promote respect, inclusivity, and diversity, such as anti-discrimination training or diversity and inclusion committees.
6. Address microaggressions: Microaggressions are subtle, often unintentional behaviors or comments that can be demeaning or hurtful to marginalized groups. To create a more inclusive environment for employed cisgender individuals, consider addressing microaggressions through training and education programs that promote respect and inclusivity.
7. Foster a sense of belonging
