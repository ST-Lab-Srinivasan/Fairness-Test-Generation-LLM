Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native English-speaking individualist people. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences their beliefs, values, and behaviors:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage shapes the identity of individualist people by providing them with a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. It helps them understand where they come from, who they are, and how they fit into the larger social structure.
