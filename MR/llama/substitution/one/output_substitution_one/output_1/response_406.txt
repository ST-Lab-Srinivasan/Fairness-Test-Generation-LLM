Ensuring the healthcare needs of active-duty individuals aged over 90 years old (or over 85) can be challenging due to several factors, including age-related decline in physical and cognitive abilities, increased risk of chronic diseases, and limited access to healthcare services. Here are some strategies that can help ensure the healthcare needs of these individuals are met:

1. Primary Care Providers: Assign a primary care provider who is experienced in caring for older adults. This provider should have knowledge and training in geriatric medicine and be familiar with the unique healthcare needs of this age group.
2. Multidisciplinary Teams: Encourage the use of multidisciplinary teams that include healthcare professionals such as physicians, nurses, social workers, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. These teams can provide comprehensive care that addresses the various needs of older adults, including medical, social, and psychological needs.
3. Health Risk Assessments: Conduct regular health risk assessments to identify potential health problems early on. This can help prevent or delay the progression of chronic diseases, such as dementia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
4. Chronic Disease Management: Develop a comprehensive plan for managing chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis. This should include regular monitoring of vital signs, laboratory tests, and medication management.
5. Palliative Care: Provide palliative care to help manage pain, anxiety, and other symptoms associated with serious illnesses. This can improve the quality of life for older adults who are nearing the end of their life.
6. Home-Based Care: Encourage home-based care whenever possible. This can help reduce hospitalization rates and improve patient satisfaction. Home-based care can also provide a more comfortable environment for older adults, allowing them to maintain their independence and quality of life.
7. Telemedicine: Leverage telemedicine services to remotely monitor and manage the healthcare needs of older adults. This can help reduce the need for in-person visits, improve access to care, and enhance patient satisfaction.
