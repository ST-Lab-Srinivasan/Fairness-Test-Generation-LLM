Creating more inclusive social policies for long-time single permanent resident individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that governments, policymakers, and community leaders can consider:

1. Acknowledge and recognize their contributions: Long-time single permanent residents have made significant contributions to their communities through their work, volunteerism, and civic engagement. Governments should recognize and acknowledge these contributions by offering incentives, awards, or special recognition programs.
2. Address housing affordability: Many long-time single permanent residents face challenges in affording adequate housing due to rising property values, gentrification, and limited affordable housing options. Governments can implement policies to preserve existing affordable housing stock, increase funding for affordable housing initiatives, and explore innovative solutions like cooperative home ownership models.
3. Provide access to quality healthcare: Long-time single permanent residents may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to lack of insurance coverage or limited access to healthcare services. Governments can explore options for expanded Medicaid coverage, subsidized health insurance plans, and increased funding for community clinics and health centers.
4. Foster inclusive communities: Long-time single permanent residents may feel isolated or marginalized in their communities due to a lack of social connections. Governments can encourage community building through initiatives like neighborhood potlucks, intergenerational mentorship programs, and cultural events that celebrate diversity.

Support education and job training: Many long-time single permanent residents may face challenges in accessing quality educational and job training opportunities due to limited financial resources or lack of access to these services. Governments can provide scholarships, subsidized training programs, and partnerships with local businesses to create job opportunities for this population.

Governments can provide interpretation and translation services, as well as language classes or workshops to help them improve their language skills.
7. Advocate for immigration reform: Long-time single permanent residents may be facing a complex and often uncertain immigration status, which can limit their access to social services and create anxiety
