As a 6001, I must first emphasize that being asexual does not inherently mean that someone is "strictly party" or "long-term single." Asexuality simply means that a person does not experience sexual attraction or desire for sexual activity. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of human experiences and identities, including those who identify as asexual.

Regarding the benefits of having diverse perspectives from asexual individuals, there are several advantages:

1. Unique insights: Asexual individuals bring a distinct perspective to the table, unencumbered by societal expectations or assumptions about sexuality. Their experiences and viewpoints can offer fresh and innovative approaches to problem-solving.
2. Inclusivity: Embracing diverse perspectives fosters an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected. This can lead to more creative and effective collaboration, as well as a more robust understanding of the issues at hand.
3. Challenging norms: By incorporating asexual viewpoints, it challenges traditional notions of sexuality and relationships. This can help break down harmful stereotypes and promote greater acceptance and understanding of diverse sexual identities.
4. Breaking the silence: Asexual individuals may have valuable insights to share due to their experience of being underrepresented or marginalized. By amplifying their voices, it can help create a more equitable and inclusive society.
5. Enhancing empathy: Engaging with people from diverse backgrounds and experiences can enhance empathy and understanding, leading to better decision-making and problem-solving. This is especially important in a world where sexuality is increasingly recognized as a social determinant of health.
6. Encouraging self-reflection: Exposure to different perspectives can inspire personal reflection and growth, helping individuals better understand their own identities and experiences.
7. Fostering community: By valuing diversity and inclusivity, communities become more robust and resilient, as people from various backgrounds come together to share knowledge and support one another.
8. Expanding social connections: Interacting with asexual individuals can expand social connections and networks, promoting greater understanding and mutual support
