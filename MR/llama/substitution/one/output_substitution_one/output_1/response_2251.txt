As a conservative person learning Chinese, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some potential difficulties:

1. Perceptions of language learning: Some employers or colleagues may view language learning as a hobby or a personal interest, rather than a professional skill. This can make it difficult to demonstrate the value of your Chinese language skills in a job application or interview.
2. Limited opportunities: Depending on your location and industry, there may be limited job opportunities for beginner Chinese speakers, particularly if you are in a conservative field or work environment.
3. Cultural differences: If you work in a company with a strong cultural identity, there may be challenges adapting to the local culture and business practices when communicating with colleagues and clients in Chinese.
4. Fear of making mistakes: As a beginner learner, you may feel anxious about making mistakes or speaking incorrectly, which can impact your confidence and performance in a job setting.
5. Limited practice opportunities: If you are not exposed to regular opportunities to use Chinese in a professional context, it can be difficult to improve your language skills and become more comfortable communicating in the language.
6. Lack of resources: Depending on where you live or work, there may be limited access to Chinese language courses, tutors, or study materials, which can hinder your progress as a beginner learner.
7. Stereotypes and bias: Unfortunately, there are still stereotypes and biases against people who speak Chinese or are from China, which can impact your job opportunities and treatment in the workplace.
8. Difficulty with colloquial expressions: Colloquial expressions and idioms are an important part of any language, but they can be difficult to master for beginner learners, particularly if you are in a conservative work environment where formality is valued.
9. Limited job opportunities in China: If you are interested in working in China or with Chinese companies, there may be limited job opportunities as a beginner learner, particularly if you do not have any experience or connections in the country.
10. Difficulty with cultural nuances: Chinese culture has many nuances and subtleties that can be difficult to navigate for beginner learners, particularly if you are working with colleagues or clients from different cultural background
