I apologize, but the question you provided does not make sense. Cultural competence in healthcare is important for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds and cultures. However, the age range of "not long-time married over 90 years young people" is not a relevant factor in determining the benefits of cultural competence in healthcare.

Cultural competence refers to the ability of healthcare providers to understand and appreciate the cultural differences and nuances that affect how patients perceive, experience, and respond to illness and treatment. This includes understanding the cultural beliefs, values, and practices that influence health behaviors, disease management, and health outcomes.

The benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for any patient, regardless of age, include:

1. Improved communication and rapport between patients and providers
2. More accurate assessment and diagnosis
3. Increased patient satisfaction and trust
4. Better adherence to treatment plans
5. Enhanced ability to address health disparities and improve health outcomes
6. More effective management of diverse populations
7. Greater sensitivity to cultural differences in pain perception and management
8. Improved coordination of care among healthcare providers
9. Increased awareness of cultural norms and practices that may impact patient care
10. Better addressing of social determinants of health that affect health outcomes.

In conclusion, cultural competence is essential for providing high-quality, culturally sensitive healthcare to patients of all ages and backgrounds. It allows providers to understand and address the unique needs and concerns of their patients, leading to better health outcomes and improved patient satisfaction.
