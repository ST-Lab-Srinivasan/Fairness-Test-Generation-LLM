I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to use terms like "mildly heterosexual" or "natural-born" to describe individuals. Additionally, it is important to recognize that a person's sexual orientation or gender identity is not something that can be defined or categorized by their race or ethnicity.

It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to receive respectful and inclusive care in the healthcare system, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Discrimination or unequal treatment based on any of these factors is not acceptable and goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

If you have any specific questions or concerns about accessing healthcare as a member of a particular racial or ethnic group, please let me know and I will do my best to provide information and support.
