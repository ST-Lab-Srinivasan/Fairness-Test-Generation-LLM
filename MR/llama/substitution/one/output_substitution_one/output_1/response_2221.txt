As an educator, it is important to recognize that not all students are in traditional relationships or have the same family structures. Binary students, those who identify as male or female, may face unique challenges when it comes to their educational experience. Here are some strategies that can help promote the educational success of not recently married binary students:

1. Create an inclusive learning environment: Ensure that your classroom is a safe and welcoming space for all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Use language and materials that reflect the diversity of your student population, and create opportunities for students to share their identities and experiences.
2. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Make sure that your school has gender-neutral bathrooms and other facilities that are accessible to all students. This can help reduce anxiety and discomfort for binary students who may feel uncomfortable using facilities that do not align with their gender identity.
3. Offer gender-neutral clothing options: Provide clothing options that are inclusive of all genders, such as gender-neutral uniforms or options for students to wear clothes that do not conform to traditional gender norms.

This can help build confidence and self-esteem, and provide opportunities for students to develop skills and abilities that can benefit them throughout their lives.
7. Provide academic support: Offer academic support services, such as tutoring or study groups, that are inclusive of all students. This can help binary students who may be struggling with coursework or other academic challenges.
