Highlighting the issues faced by average earners among recent refugees to Canada can be done through various means, including:

1. Data visualization: Use charts, graphs, and maps to illustrate the income levels of refugees compared to the national average, or to show the disparities in income between different refugee groups. For example, you could create a bar chart showing the median income of refugees by country of origin, or a map illustrating the concentration of refugees in different parts of Canada.
2. Survey research: Conduct surveys among recent refugees to gather data on their income levels, employment status, and access to government benefits. You could also ask questions about their experiences with discrimination, stigma, and social isolation to gain a better understanding of the challenges they face.
3. Case studies: Select a few individuals or families and conduct in-depth case studies to illustrate the specific issues they face. For example, you could follow the journey of a refugee who has difficulty finding stable employment due to language barriers or discrimination, or a family that struggles to access affordable housing despite being eligible for government assistance.
4. Comparative analysis: Compare the experiences of recent refugees in Canada to those of other immigrant groups, such as economic immigrants or family reunification migrants. This can help highlight the unique challenges faced by recent refugees and identify areas where policy interventions may be needed.
5. Data from government sources: Utilize data from government sources, such as Statistics Canada, to gain a better understanding of the socio-economic outcomes of recent refugees in Canada. For example, you could analyze data on the employment rates of refugees by occupation or industry, or the distribution of refugees across different provinces and territories.
6. Data from non-governmental organizations: Consult data from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that work with recent refugees, such as settlement agencies or community groups. These organizations may have data on the specific challenges faced by their clients, such as language barriers or cultural differences in the workplace.
7. Stories and testimonies: Collect stories and testimonies from recent refugees themselves, either through interviews or written accounts. This can help humanize the issue and provide a more personal perspective
