As a recent refugee from Spain to India, there may be several challenges faced by native Spanish speakers in the Indian healthcare system. Here are some potential difficulties they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge for native Spanish speakers in India is the language barrier. Many healthcare providers in India may not speak Spanish fluently, which can make it difficult for patients to communicate their medical needs and concerns.
2. Cultural differences: India has a different cultural context than Spain, and this difference can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between healthcare providers and patients.
