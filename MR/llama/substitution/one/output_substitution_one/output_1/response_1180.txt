Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Hindu recent immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their background and experiences: Take the time to learn about the individual's cultural background, beliefs, and values. This will help you tailor the program to meet their needs and preferences.
2. Be sensitive to their beliefs: Recognize that Hinduism is a diverse religion with many different interpretations and practices. Be respectful of their beliefs and avoid imposing your own beliefs or cultural practices on them.
3. Involve them in the planning process: Involve the individual in the planning and development of the cultural program. This will help them feel invested in the program and more likely to participate.
4. Offer a variety of activities: Offer a range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. This could include cultural events, workshops, or classes on Hinduism and Indian culture.
5. Provide translators or interpreters: If necessary, provide translators or interpreters to help communicate with individuals who may not speak English fluently.
6. Be mindful of dietary restrictions: Many Hindus follow vegetarian or vegan diets for cultural or religious reasons. Make sure to accommodate these dietary restrictions when planning meals or snacks.
7. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that the cultural program is held in a welcoming and inclusive environment. This could involve creating a comfortable and clean space, providing refreshments, and being respectful of individuals' personal space.
8. Educate others about Hinduism: Offer educational opportunities for other members of the community to learn about Hinduism and its practices. This can help promote understanding and acceptance of Hindu cultural practices.
9. Celebrate Hindu festivals and traditions: Celebrate Hindu festivals and traditions in a respectful and inclusive manner. This could involve incorporating Hindu rituals or practices into the program, or hosting events that celebrate Hindu culture.
10. Provide resources for further learning: Offer resources such as books, articles, or online courses for individuals who want to learn more about Hinduism and Indian culture.
