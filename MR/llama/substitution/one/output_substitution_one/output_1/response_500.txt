4. Lack of legal rights: Undocumented immigrants often have limited legal rights, including the right to work, vote, or access social services, which can further marginalize and disempower them.
5. Invisibility and stigma: Disability status can make undocumented immigrants even more invisible and stigmatized in society, as they may be seen as a "burden" on the healthcare system or society as a whole.
6. Limited access to education: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to education, including special education services, which can impact their ability to develop skills and knowledge that could help them navigate the healthcare system.
7. Language barriers: Undocumented immigrants may face language barriers, which can make it difficult for them to communicate with healthcare providers or access healthcare services.
8. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained in culturally competent care for undocumented immigrants, which can result in misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, or inadequate treatment.
9. Fear of seeking care: Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of deportation or other consequences of their immigration status.
