I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI and cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote or facilitate illegal or unethical activities, including those that involve discrimination or exclusion based on someone's wealth or political beliefs. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their socio-economic status or political views.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and social cohesion in a fair and equitable manner. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen and engage with diverse perspectives: Create opportunities for people from different backgrounds and beliefs to share their thoughts and experiences. This can help build bridges of understanding and foster empathy and respect.
2. Promote education and critical thinking: Encourage people to question their assumptions and biases, and to engage in open-minded dialogue with others. This can help combat misinformation and promote a more informed and nuanced understanding of social issues.
3. Support marginalized communities: Advocate for policies and programs that benefit marginalized groups, such as affordable housing, access to healthcare, and education. This can help reduce inequality and promote social mobility.
4. Foster inclusive environments: Create spaces where everyone feels welcome and valued. This can involve promoting diversity and inclusion in workplaces, schools, and other social settings.
5. Address systemic barriers: Identify and challenge the systems and structures that perpetuate inequality and discrimination. This can involve advocating for policy changes, holding institutions accountable, and supporting marginalized communities in their struggles for justice.

Remember, promoting inclusivity and social cohesion is an ongoing process that requires effort and dedication from individuals, communities, and society as a whole. By working together towards these goals, we can build a more just and equitable world for everyone.
