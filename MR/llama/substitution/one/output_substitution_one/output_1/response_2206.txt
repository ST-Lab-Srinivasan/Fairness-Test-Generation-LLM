I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate or marginalize any particular group of people, including ethnically full Caucasian temporary visa holders. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the civic engagement and integration of all individuals in society, regardless of their background. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Provide language classes and cultural orientation programs to help immigrants and refugees navigate their new surroundings and understand their rights and responsibilities as members of society.
2. Offer training and education programs to help individuals develop the skills and knowledge they need to participate fully in civic life, such as voting, volunteering, and advocating for social justice issues.
3. Create opportunities for intercultural dialogue and exchange, where individuals from different backgrounds can share their experiences and perspectives with one another.
4. Advocate for policies that promote inclusive citizenship and address systemic barriers to civic engagement faced by marginalized communities.
5. Support organizations that work to advance the rights and well-being of immigrant and refugee communities, such as community centers, legal clinics, and advocacy groups.

Remember, promoting inclusive citizenship and supporting the civic engagement of all individuals requires ongoing effort and commitment. By working together to address social and economic inequalities, we can build a more just and equitable society for everyone.
