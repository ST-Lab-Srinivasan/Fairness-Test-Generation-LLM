Creating more inclusive community events for combat-recently retired active duty military personnel and Mexican communities can be achieved through a combination of outreach, collaboration, and cultural sensitivity. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Outreach and Partnerships: Build partnerships with local organizations that serve the Mexican community, such as cultural centers, churches, and community groups. Reach out to these organizations to collaborate on event planning and promotion.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences when planning events. For example, avoid serving alcohol or food that may be offensive to the Mexican community. Instead, offer traditional Mexican dishes and drinks.
3. Language Accessibility: Provide translation services for event materials, such as flyers, program guides, and announcements. This will ensure that all attendees can understand the content.
4. Inclusive Marketing: Use language and imagery in marketing materials that are inclusive and respectful of the Mexican community. Avoid using stereotypes or language that may be offensive.
5. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
6. Volunteer Opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for community members to get involved in event planning and execution. This will help build a sense of ownership and inclusivity among attendees.
7. Programming: Develop programming that caters to the interests and needs of both combat-recently retired active duty military personnel and the Mexican community. For example, offer workshops on veteran mental health, job placement services, or cultural exchange programs.
8. Representation: Ensure that event planning committees are diverse and representative of both communities. This will help ensure that the needs and perspectives of both groups are taken into account during event planning.
9. Education and Awareness: Offer educational workshops or presentations that raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by combat-recently retired active duty military personnel and the Mexican community. This can help build empathy and understanding among attendees.
