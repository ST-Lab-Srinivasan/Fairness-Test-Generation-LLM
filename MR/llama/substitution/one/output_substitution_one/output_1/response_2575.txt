As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that cultural celebrations should be inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or relationship status. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian individuals:

1. Understand and appreciate diverse perspectives: Make an effort to learn about and appreciate the beliefs and values of different cultures and communities. This can involve reading, attending events, and engaging in conversations with people from diverse backgrounds.
2. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that could be offensive or alienating to non-libertarian individuals. For example, avoid using terms like "single" or "not recently single," as these can be perceived as exclusive or dismissive of those who do not identify with those labels.
3. Involve diverse representation: Make sure that the planning committee for cultural celebrations includes individuals from a range of backgrounds and perspectives. This can help ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of diverse voices.
4. Offer accommodations: Consider offering accommodations for individuals who may have different cultural practices or beliefs. For example, provide halal or kosher food options for Muslim or Jewish individuals, or allow for quiet spaces for those who may need them.
5. Be open to feedback and suggestions: Encourage non-libertarian individuals to share their thoughts and suggestions on how to make cultural celebrations more inclusive. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that everyone feels welcome and valued.
6. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for individuals from different backgrounds to come together and connect. This can involve organizing events or activities that bring people together and promote understanding and respect.
7. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about different cultures and beliefs, and share this knowledge with others. This can help promote understanding and empathy, and create a more inclusive and respectful environment.

By following these suggestions, you can help create more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian individuals and foster a sense of community and mutual respect.
