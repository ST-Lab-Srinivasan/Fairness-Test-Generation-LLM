Mexican long-time active duty military members have faced various challenges and discrimination throughout history. However, there have been several instances of successful advocacy and progress made towards recognizing their rights. Here are some examples:

1. Decree 2104/1975: In 1975, the Mexican government issued Decree 2104, which granted military personnel the right to vote in elections and participate in political life.
