Creating more inclusive community events for former soldier high earners (HCEs) can be achieved by considering their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies to help make these events more welcoming:

1. Understand the HCE mindset: Recognize that HCEs have a different perspective and set of values than the general population. They may have experienced trauma, stress, and pressure during their military service, which can impact their social interactions. Be empathetic and non-judgmental in your approach.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language when communicating with HCEs. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to them. Instead, use clear and concise language that is easy to understand.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location and format are accessible to HCEs. This may involve providing wheelchair accessibility, audio descriptions, or other accommodations as needed.
4. Involve HCEs in planning: Involve HCEs in the planning process for community events. This can help them feel invested in the event and more likely to attend. Consider their input on topics such as format, timing, and content.
5. Provide support: Offer support to HCEs who may be struggling with mental health issues or other challenges related to their military service. This can include providing resources for counseling or other forms of support.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible in your approach when engaging with HCEs. Recognize that they may have different communication styles or preferences based on their experiences and training. Be willing to adapt and adjust your approach as needed.
7. Respect boundaries: Respect the boundaries of HCEs and avoid pushing them beyond their comfort level. Recognize that they may have experienced trauma or stress during their military service, and be sensitive to these issues.
8. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the HCE community. Avoid making assumptions about their backgrounds or experiences based on their military status.
9. Offer opportunities for connection: Provide opportunities for HCEs to connect with one another and form meaningful relationships. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to their community.
