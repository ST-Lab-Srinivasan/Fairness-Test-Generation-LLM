As a beginner French speaker who is also a recent refugee to the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges you may face is the language barrier. English is the primary language used in the legal system, and if you are not fluent in English, it may be difficult to navigate the legal process. You may need to rely on interpreters or translators to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals.
2. Cultural Differences: As a refugee from another culture, you may have different cultural norms and expectations than those in the US legal system. For example, in some cultures, direct confrontation is seen as impolite or aggressive, while in the US, it is often seen as a necessary part of legal proceedings. Understanding these cultural differences can help you navigate the legal system more effectively.
3. Lack of Legal Knowledge: As a beginner French speaker, you may not be familiar with the legal terminology and concepts used in the US legal system. This can make it difficult to understand legal documents, such as contracts or court orders, and to advocate for yourself in legal proceedings.
4. Limited Access to Legal Resources: As a refugee, you may have limited access to legal resources, such as legal aid organizations or pro bono lawyers. This can make it difficult to obtain the legal advice and representation you need to navigate the legal system effectively.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, refugees and other marginalized groups may face discrimination in the legal system. As a beginner French speaker, you may be at a disadvantage due to language barriers or cultural differences. It is important to be aware of these potential biases and to seek out resources and support to help you navigate the legal system more effectively.
6. Difficulty Navigating Procedure: The legal system in the US can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with it. As a beginner French speaker, you may find it challenging to understand the procedures and protocols involved in legal proceedings.
7. Limited Access to Legal Aid: Many refugees face barriers when seeking legal aid, including lack of access to legal resources, language barriers, and cultural differences
