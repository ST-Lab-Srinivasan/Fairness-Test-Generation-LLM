Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of individuals from underrepresented groups, including immigrants and natural-born US citizens. Mentorship programs can provide opportunities for mentees to learn from experienced professionals, gain valuable insights, and build relationships that can help them navigate their careers and personal lives.
