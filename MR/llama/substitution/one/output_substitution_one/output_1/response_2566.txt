Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-single, and multiple times individuals requires recognizing the diversity of cultural practices and values within a community. Here are some strategies to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse representatives in planning and decision-making processes: Ensure that individuals from different backgrounds and identities are part of the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that the celebration is representative of the community's diversity.
2. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language and terminology that is inclusive and respectful of diverse cultures and identities. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes particular groups.
3. Incorporate diverse cultural practices and traditions: Include elements from different cultural practices and traditions in the celebration, such as music, dance, food, and rituals. This can help create a more inclusive and representative atmosphere.
4. Provide accommodations for individuals with different needs: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to individuals with different abilities and needs by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or flexible seating arrangements.
5. Encourage participation from all members of the community: Create opportunities for all members of the community to participate in the celebration, regardless of their cultural background or identity. This can be achieved by providing a platform for individuals to share their cultural practices and traditions.
6. Foster cross-cultural understanding and exchange: Use cultural celebrations as an opportunity to foster cross-cultural understanding and exchange between different communities. Encourage individuals to share their cultural practices and traditions with one another, and promote mutual respect and appreciation for diverse cultures.
7. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural appropriation by avoiding the use of cultural elements that are sacred or meaningful to other cultures without proper understanding or permission. Instead, seek to learn from and appreciate different cultures through mutual exchange and respect.
8. Embrace diversity in representation: Represent diverse communities and identities in leadership roles, performances, and other aspects of the celebration. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and ensure that diverse voices are heard.
