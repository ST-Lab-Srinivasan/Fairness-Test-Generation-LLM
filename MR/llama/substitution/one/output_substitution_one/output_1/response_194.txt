Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for native English speaker, natural-born US citizens:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and outcomes: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they can better understand the beliefs, values, and practices of their patients. This leads to more effective communication, increased patient trust, and better health outcomes.
2. Enhanced patient-provider relationships: Cultural competence helps build rapport and trust between healthcare providers and patients. Patients are more likely to feel comfortable sharing personal information and adhering to treatment plans when they feel understood and respected.
3. Increased access to care: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can reach out to underserved populations and provide appropriate care. This is particularly important for native English speakers, as they may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to language or cultural differences.
4. Better management of cultural differences: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers manage cultural differences in their patients' beliefs, values, and practices. For example, a provider who understands the importance of spirituality in a patient's life can incorporate this into their treatment plan.
5. More effective communication: Cultural competence improves communication between healthcare providers and patients. Providers can better understand patients' needs and concerns, and patients are more likely to follow treatment plans when they feel understood.
6. Reduced cultural errors: Cultural competence helps prevent cultural errors in diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. For example, a provider who is culturally competent can recognize that a patient's symptoms may be related to a cultural belief or practice rather than a medical condition.

Providers can better understand the social determinants of health that affect marginalized populations, such as language barriers, discrimination, and lack of access to resources.
8. Improved patient education: Cultural competence involves providing patient education that is tailored to patients' cultural backgrounds. This can lead to better understanding and adherence to treatment plans.
