Creating more inclusive social policies for blue-collar ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Acknowledge the existing gender gap: The gender pay gap is still prevalent in many countries, with women on average earning less than men. Ex-spouses who were breadwinners during their marriage may struggle to make ends meet after divorce, especially if they have not had the opportunity to build up savings or assets. Policies should aim to address this gap by promoting equal pay for equal work and providing support for low-income families.
2. Improve access to education and job training: Many blue-collar ex-spouses may lack the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the modern job market. Governments can invest in vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and other forms of job training to help them acquire new skills and transition to higher-paying careers.
3. Encourage flexible work arrangements: Blue-collar ex-spouses may face barriers to finding employment due to childcare responsibilities or other family obligations. Policies should promote flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting, part-time work, or job sharing, to help them balance their work and family commitments.
4. Provide affordable childcare: Affordable childcare is essential for blue-collar ex-spouses who want to pursue employment or education opportunities. Governments can invest in subsidized childcare programs or provide tax credits to help offset the cost of care.
5. Address discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination against blue-collar ex-spouses based on their gender, race, or socioeconomic status still exists. Policies should aim to address these forms of discrimination by promoting equal opportunities and challenging biases in the workplace and society at large.
6. Offer financial support: Blue-collar ex-spouses may struggle to make ends meet after divorce, especially if they have not had the opportunity to build up savings or assets. Policies can provide financial assistance, such as alimony or child support payments, to help them get back on their feet.
