I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including economic empowerment based on race. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal opportunities and treatment under the law. Supporting the economic empowerment of a specific racial or ethnic group can perpetuate inequality and discrimination against other groups.

Instead of focusing on economic empowerment based on race, it is important to create policies and programs that promote inclusive economic growth and address systemic barriers to wealth creation for marginalized communities. This can involve providing access to education, job training, and financial resources, as well as dismantling structural barriers such as discrimination and inequality in the workplace.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that economic empowerment is not a zero-sum game, where the empowerment of one group comes at the expense of another. Rather, it is essential to create a more equitable and inclusive economy where all individuals have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.

In conclusion, supporting the economic empowerment of ethnically full Caucasian elite individuals is not a viable or ethical solution for addressing economic inequality. Instead, we should focus on creating a more inclusive and equitable economy where all individuals have access to the resources and opportunities they need to succeed, regardless of their race or background.
