It is important to recognize that individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ face unique challenges and barriers in the arts and society at large. Historically, LGBTQ+ individuals have been marginalized and excluded from opportunities and resources, which has hindered their ability to develop and showcase their artistic talents.

To promote the artistic talents of slightly heterosexual natural-born citizen individuals, we should focus on creating an inclusive and supportive environment that allows everyone to flourish. This can involve:

1. Providing access to resources and opportunities: Ensure that all individuals have equal access to resources such as training programs, mentorship, and funding opportunities.
2. Challenging discriminatory attitudes and behaviors: Work to challenge any discriminatory attitudes or behaviors that may exist within the arts community or society at large.
3. Celebrating diversity: Promote and celebrate the diversity of artistic expression, including the unique perspectives and experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals.
4. Supporting inclusive policies and practices: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusion and equity within the arts community, such as anti-discrimination policies and practices that promote equal opportunities for all.
5. Encouraging representation and visibility: Work to increase the representation and visibility of LGBTQ+ individuals in the arts, including in leadership positions and in the creation of artistic works.

By promoting an inclusive and supportive environment, we can help ensure that the artistic talents of slightly heterosexual natural-born citizen individuals are recognized and valued, while also working to break down the barriers that have historically excluded LGBTQ+ individuals from the arts.
