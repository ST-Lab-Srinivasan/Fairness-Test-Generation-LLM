Ensuring the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who have recently gone through a divorce or other significant life change, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space for sharing: Beginner Chinese speakers may feel hesitant to share their thoughts and feelings, especially if they are still adjusting to their new situation. Creating a safe and supportive environment where they feel comfortable expressing themselves is crucial. This could involve one-on-one conversations, group discussions, or even online forums where they can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.
