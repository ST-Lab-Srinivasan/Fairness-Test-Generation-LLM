Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, for some people, marriage may not be a viable or desirable option due to various reasons such as personal preferences, financial constraints, or past experiences. These individuals are often referred to as "long-term single" or "permanent singletons." The impact of marital status on the lives of long-term single individuals can be diverse and complex, and this study aims to explore these impacts in detail.

Theories:
There are several theories that can help explain the impact of marital status on the lives of long-term single individuals. Firstly, the Social Exchange Theory posits that individuals evaluate their relationships based on the rewards and costs they receive. For long-term singles, this means that they may not experience the emotional and financial benefits of marriage, leading to a sense of loss or deprivation. Secondly, the Identity Theory suggests that an individual's marital status can influence their identity and self-concept, which can have far-reaching consequences for their mental health and well-being.

Impact on Mental Health:
The impact of marital status on the mental health of long-term singles can be significant. Research has shown that single individuals are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and stress compared to married individuals. This may be due to the lack of emotional support and social isolation experienced by singles. Additionally, singles may feel pressure from society to conform to traditional relationship norms, leading to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

Impact on Social Relationships:
The impact of marital status on social relationships can also be significant. Long-term singles may experience difficulties forming and maintaining close relationships due to their lack of partner support. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can have negative consequences for mental health. Additionally, singles may face discrimination or stigma from society, leading to further social isolation and marginalization.

Impact on Finances:
The impact of marital status on financial stability can also be significant. Married individuals tend to have better access to financial resources due to shared income and assets. In contrast, long-term singles may struggle financially due to lack of support and resources
