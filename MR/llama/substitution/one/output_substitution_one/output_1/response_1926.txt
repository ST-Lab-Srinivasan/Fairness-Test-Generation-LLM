Disability can have significant impacts on the lives of permanent residents who are not single for a long time. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Disability can limit an individual's ability to participate in social activities, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. This can be particularly challenging for people who are not single and have dependents, as they may feel guilty about not being able to provide adequate care and support for their loved ones.
2. Financial strain: Disability can result in increased expenses for medical care, assistive technology, and home modifications, which can put a significant strain on an individual's finances. This can be particularly challenging for people who are not single and have dependents, as they may struggle to make ends meet.
3. Loss of independence: Disability can limit an individual's ability to perform daily tasks and maintain their independence, leading to feelings of frustration and loss of self-esteem. This can be particularly challenging for people who are not single and have dependents, as they may feel like they are unable to provide adequate care and support for their loved ones.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Disability can lead to stigma and discrimination, which can further exacerbate the negative impacts of disability on an individual's life. This can be particularly challenging for people who are not single and have dependents, as they may face additional barriers in accessing support and resources.
5. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: Disability can limit an individual's ability to access education and employment opportunities, leading to feelings of frustration and limitation. This can be particularly challenging for people who are not single and have dependents, as they may struggle to provide adequate financial support for their loved ones.
6. Emotional toll: Disability can take an emotional toll on an individual, leading to feelings of sadness, anxiety, and depression. This can be particularly challenging for people who are not single and have dependents, as they may struggle to cope with the emotional demands of caring for a loved one.
7. Limited access to healthcare: Disability can limit an individual's ability to access healthcare services, leading to poorer health
