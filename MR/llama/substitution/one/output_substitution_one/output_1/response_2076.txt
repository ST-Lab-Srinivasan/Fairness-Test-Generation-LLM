Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Term Single Mandarin Individuals

Abstract: This study examines the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of long-term single Mandarin individuals. Through in-depth interviews and cultural artifact analysis, we identify how cultural practices, values, and beliefs shape these individuals' sense of self and belonging. Our findings reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping identities, with participants drawing on their cultural background to make sense of their singleness and to construct meaningful lives.

Introduction: In contemporary China, the rise of singlehood has led to increased attention to the topic of singleness and its impact on individuals' well-being. While research has explored the psychological and social aspects of singleness, little is known about the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities of long-term single Mandarin individuals. This study aims to fill this gap by examining how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals.

Methodology: We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 long-term single Mandarin individuals, aged 35-60 years old. Participants were selected through purposive sampling, ensuring a mix of genders and urban/rural locations. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and we analyzed the data using thematic analysis. We also analyzed cultural artifacts, such as traditional clothing, jewelry, and decorative items, to gain insights into participants' cultural practices and values.

Results: Our findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-term single Mandarin individuals. Participants drew on their cultural background to make sense of their singleness, using cultural practices, values, and beliefs to construct meaningful lives. We identified three themes: (1) Cultural identity and belonging, (2) Traditional gender roles and expectations, and (3) The significance of family and community.

Cultural identity and belonging: Participants expressed a strong sense of cultural identity and belonging, which was closely tied to their singleness. They saw themselves as part of a larger cultural heritage, with its own values, beliefs, and practices. This
