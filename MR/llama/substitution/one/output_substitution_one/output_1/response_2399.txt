Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identity among Long-Term Native Arabic Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who are native Arabic speakers. The preservation and transmission of cultural practices, beliefs, values, and customs from one generation to the next help define an individual's sense of self and belonging. This study aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of long-term native Arabic speakers.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can influence identity formation in various ways. For instance, studies have found that cultural practices and traditions are often passed down from parents to children, providing a sense of continuity and belonging (Hood, 2014). Additionally, cultural heritage can shape an individual's values, beliefs, and worldview, influencing their personal identity (Guthrie, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with long-term native Arabic speakers. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and will undergo semi-structured interviews to gather data on their experiences and perceptions of cultural heritage. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis.

Analysis:
Data analysis will involve a thematic analysis approach, where codes and categories will be developed based on the participants' responses. The following themes are expected to emerge from the data: (1) cultural practices and traditions, (2) language and communication, (3) identity formation and expression, and (4) challenges and opportunities.

Expected Results:
The findings of this study are expected to provide insights into the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of long-term native Arabic speakers. The following hypotheses will be tested:

1. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-term native Arabic speakers, influencing their values, beliefs, and worldview.
2. Language and communication are crucial in transmitting cultural practices and traditions from one generation to the next, thereby preserving cultural
