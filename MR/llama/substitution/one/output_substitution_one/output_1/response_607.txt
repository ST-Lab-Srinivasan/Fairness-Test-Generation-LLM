Creating more inclusive community programs for native Spanish speakers who are recently single can be achieved by taking into consideration their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural nuances and traditions of native Spanish speakers, especially those related to family and relationships. This can involve incorporating traditional practices and rituals into program activities, such as sharing meals or engaging in group dancing.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that programs are accessible to all participants, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or Braille materials for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and feelings. Encourage open communication and active listening among participants, and provide resources for those who may be struggling with the transition to single life.
4. Community building: Organize activities that foster a sense of community and connection among participants. This can involve organizing group outings, hosting potlucks or cooking classes, or facilitating small group discussions on topics relevant to the single life experience.
5. Education and resources: Provide educational materials and resources on topics such as financial literacy, mental health, and career development. Offer workshops or seminars on these subjects, led by experts in their field, and provide one-on-one coaching or mentoring for those who are interested.
6. Social media support: Create a private online community or Facebook group where participants can connect with each other, share their experiences, and receive support from peers and mentors. This can be an effective way to build connections and foster a sense of belonging among participants.
7. Personalized support: Offer personalized support to participants based on their individual needs and goals. This can involve one-on-one coaching or mentoring, as well as connecting participants with local resources and services that can help them navigate the challenges of single life.
8. Intergenerational connections: Encourage intergenerational connections by pairing younger native Spanish speakers with older individuals who have experienced similar challenges. This can involve organizing group outings or activities where participants can learn from each other and build relationships.
