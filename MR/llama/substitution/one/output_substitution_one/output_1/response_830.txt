Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-class binary individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various forms of discrimination and marginalization they face. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Recognize and challenge existing power structures: Identify the systems, institutions, and power dynamics that perpetuate inequality and work towards dismantling them. This includes addressing the historical and systemic barriers that have hindered social mobility for non-upper-class individuals.
