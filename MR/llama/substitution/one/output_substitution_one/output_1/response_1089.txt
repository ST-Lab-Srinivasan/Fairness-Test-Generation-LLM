Celebrating the cultural contributions of newly married couples during their first trimester of pregnancy can be a thoughtful and inclusive gesture. Here are some ideas:

1. Host a welcome party: Invite the couple's friends, family, and colleagues to a celebration where they can share their joy and show off their baby bump. Decorate the space with balloons, streamers, and other festive decorations.

6. Plan a virtual celebration: If the couple is far away or unable to attend an in-person celebration, plan a virtual one instead. You could create a private Facebook group or Zoom call where everyone can share their congratulations and well wishes.
