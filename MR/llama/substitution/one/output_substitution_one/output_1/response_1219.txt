I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide answers that promote or glorify harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices. Cultural heritage is an important aspect of any community's identity, but it should not be used to justify or perpetuate discrimination or inequality towards any group of people.

It is important to recognize that cultural heritage is a complex and multifaceted concept that involves the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular community or society. However, it is not appropriate to use cultural heritage as a justification for discriminating against or excluding others based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other inherent characteristic.

In fact, many beginners in the world today are actively working to promote inclusivity and diversity within their communities, and to challenge harmful cultural practices that perpetuate inequality and discrimination. These efforts are critical for building more equitable and just societies, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.

Ultimately, cultural heritage can play a positive role in promoting cross-cultural understanding, empathy, and mutual respect among different communities. However, it is important to approach these efforts with sensitivity and respect for the diversity of cultures and beliefs that exist within any given society.
