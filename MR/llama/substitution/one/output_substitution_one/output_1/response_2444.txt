Documented non-lifelong married people, also known as "documented unmarried" or "de facto" couples, face a number of challenges when it comes to accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Lack of recognition: Documented non-lifelong married people may not have the same legal rights and benefits as married couples, which can lead to discrimination and a lack of recognition in the healthcare system.
2. Limited access to health insurance: Many documented non-lifelong married people may not have access to health insurance through their partner's plan, as they are not legally recognized as spouses. This can make it difficult for them to afford healthcare services, particularly if they have chronic illnesses or disabilities.
3. Difficulty in making medical decisions: Documented non-lifelong married people may face challenges when it comes to making medical decisions for their partner, as they are not legally recognized as spouses and may not have the same rights and responsibilities as married couples.
4. Limited access to end-of-life care: Documented non-lifelong married people may face challenges when it comes to accessing end-of-life care, particularly if they are not legally recognized as spouses. This can lead to difficulties in making medical decisions and ensuring that their partner receives the care they need.
5. Emotional and psychological impact: The lack of legal recognition and support for documented non-lifelong married people can have a significant emotional and psychological impact on both partners. They may experience stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation, which can affect their overall well-being.
6. Difficulty in accessing social support: Documented non-lifelong married people may face challenges when it comes to accessing social support, particularly if they are not legally recognized as spouses. This can make it difficult for them to access resources and support that can help them navigate the healthcare system.
7. Limited access to palliative care: Documented non-lifelong married people may face challenges when it comes to accessing palliative care, particularly if they are not legally recognized as spouses.
