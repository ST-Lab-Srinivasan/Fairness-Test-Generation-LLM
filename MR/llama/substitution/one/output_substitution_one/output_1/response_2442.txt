Introduction:
Marriage is an important social institution that can have a significant impact on an individual's life. In Mexico, the cultural and legal implications of marriage can be particularly complex, especially for those in their third trimester of pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently late pregnant (3rd trimester) Mexican individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's mental and physical health, as well as their social and economic well-being. For example, married individuals tend to have better access to healthcare and social support compared to unmarried individuals (Koenig et al., 2013). However, the specific impacts of marital status on pregnant women in Mexico are not well understood.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of pregnant women in their third trimester in Mexico, collecting data on their marital status, access to healthcare, social support, and other relevant factors. In addition, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gather more detailed information on their experiences and perceptions of the impacts of marital status on their lives during pregnancy.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the limited existing research on the impacts of marital status on pregnant women in Mexico. By examining the specific challenges and opportunities faced by recently late pregnant (3rd trimester) Mexican individuals, this study can inform policies and programs aimed at improving their healthcare access, social support, and overall well-being.

Expected Outcomes:
This study is expected to reveal the following impacts of marital status on recently late pregnant (3rd trimester) Mexican individuals:

1. Access to Healthcare: Married women may have better access to prenatal care and other healthcare services compared to unmarried women, due to their spouse's influence or financial support.
2. Social Support: Married women may experience greater social support from their spouses and families during pregnancy, which can positively impact their mental
