Creating more inclusive social policies for non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various forms of discrimination and marginalization that they may face. Here are some strategies that can be employed to create more inclusive policies:

1. Collect Data: The first step is to collect data on the experiences of non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals in different contexts, such as education, employment, healthcare, and criminal justice. This data can help identify areas where policies are failing and create a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges they face.
2. Consult with Communities: Engage with non-lower middle-income cisgender communities to understand their experiences and perspectives. This can involve conducting focus groups, surveys, and other forms of community engagement to ensure that policies are responsive to their needs.
3. Address Systemic Inequality: Identify the systemic inequalities that non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals face and develop policies that address these inequalities directly. For example, policies that address discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation can help create a more inclusive environment.
4. Promote Access to Education and Employment: Ensure access to education and employment opportunities for non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals by providing scholarships, mentorship programs, and job training initiatives. This can help reduce inequality and improve their socio-economic status.
5. Improve Healthcare Access: Develop policies that improve access to healthcare for non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals, including mental health services, reproductive healthcare, and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.
6. Address Criminal Justice Issues: Develop policies that address the criminal justice issues faced by non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals, such as racial profiling, police brutality, and inadequate legal representation.
7. Foster Inclusive Communities: Create policies that foster inclusive communities where non-lower middle-income cisgender individuals feel safe and valued. This can involve initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion, such as cultural festivals, community service projects, and interfaith dialog
