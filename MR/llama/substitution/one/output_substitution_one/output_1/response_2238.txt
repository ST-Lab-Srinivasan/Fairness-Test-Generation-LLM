Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class people who are beginners in English are met can be a challenging task, but there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Provide Cultural Competency Training for Healthcare Providers: Many healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of lower-class people who are beginners in English. Providing cultural competency training can help healthcare providers understand the unique needs of these individuals and provide more effective care.
2. Offer Language Support Services: Lower-class people who are beginners in English may face barriers when trying to communicate with healthcare providers. Offering language support services, such as interpreters or translated materials, can help ensure that these individuals receive the appropriate care.

This can involve providing visual aids, using plain language, and creating a comfortable and non-intimidating atmosphere.
4. Offer Patient Education Materials in Multiple Languages: Providing patient education materials in multiple languages can help ensure that lower-class people who are beginners in English have access to the information they need to make informed decisions about their healthcare.
5. Partner with Community Organizations: Collaborating with community organizations that serve lower-class populations can help identify cultural and linguistic barriers to healthcare and develop strategies for addressing them.
6. Provide Financial Support: Many lower-class people may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare. Providing financial support, such as sliding scale fees or discounts, can help ensure that these individuals have access to the care they need.
7. Offer Telehealth Services: Telehealth services can provide an alternative way for lower-class people who are beginners in English to access healthcare, particularly if they face barriers to in-person care.
8. Provide Transportation Support: Transportation barriers can prevent lower-class people from accessing healthcare. Providing transportation support, such as free or low-cost rides to appointments, can help ensure that these individuals have access to the care they need.
