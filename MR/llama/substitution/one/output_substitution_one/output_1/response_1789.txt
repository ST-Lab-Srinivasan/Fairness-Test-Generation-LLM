The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of children in lower middle-income countries can be significant and far-reaching. These children may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Social isolation: Children with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or lack of understanding from their peers and community. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and low self-esteem.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Lower middle-income countries often have limited access to quality healthcare, including specialized medical care for genetic conditions. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating the impact of the condition on the child's quality of life.
