Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Spanish speaker refugees in the US requires a thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency and diversity for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the unique needs and experiences of refugees from different cultures, including native Spanish speakers.
2. Inclusive Programming: Develop programs that are inclusive and respectful of diverse cultures. This can include offering a variety of activities and events that cater to the interests and preferences of native Spanish speakers, such as traditional music, dance, and art from their home countries.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that program materials and communications are available in both English and Spanish, and that programs are accessible to individuals with limited English proficiency.
4. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to reach native Spanish speakers and other under-resourced populations. This can involve partnering with local organizations and community groups to promote program awareness and access.
