Non-middle-class mixed-American heritage people in the United States may face a range of challenges when accessing and navigating the healthcare system. These challenges can be particularly pronounced for individuals who are part of racial or ethnic minority groups, as they may experience discrimination, bias, or cultural insensitivity within the healthcare system. Here are some of the specific challenges that non-middle-class mixed-American heritage people may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who are fluent in multiple languages and speak different languages at home may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers who only speak one language. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical needs or treatment plans.
2. Cultural insensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the cultural practices or beliefs of non-middle-class mixed-American heritage individuals, which can result in inappropriate or invasive medical procedures.

Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of the population it serves, which can lead to a lack of cultural competency and understanding of the unique needs of non-middle-class mixed-American heritage individuals. This can result in inadequate care or misdiagnosis based on cultural misunderstandings.

For example, they may face longer wait times for appointments or procedures, or have limited access to preventive care services.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Non-middle-class mixed-American heritage individuals may experience stigma or discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background within the healthcare system. This can lead to feelings of isolation or marginalization, which can negatively impact
