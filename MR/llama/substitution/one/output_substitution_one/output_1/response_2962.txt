Creating more inclusive social policies for deep poverty individuals, including those who are newly single and have been in that state for many years, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and recognizes the unique challenges faced by this population. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Address systemic barriers: Deep poverty is often the result of systemic issues such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and inadequate social safety nets. Policymakers must address these underlying issues by implementing policies that promote equity and inclusion.
2. Provide access to affordable housing: Many deep poverty individuals face difficulty affording basic necessities such as housing. Inclusive social policies can provide subsidies or other forms of assistance to help make housing more affordable.
3. Improve access to healthcare: Deep poverty individuals often face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints. Policymakers can work towards improving access to affordable healthcare by expanding insurance coverage and investing in community health clinics.
4. Increase access to education and job training: Education and job training programs can help deep poverty individuals acquire the skills they need to secure better-paying jobs and improve their economic stability. Policymakers can invest in these programs and make them more accessible to marginalized communities.
5. Address food insecurity: Food insecurity is a common challenge faced by deep poverty individuals. Policymakers can work towards addressing this issue by implementing policies that increase access to nutritious food, such as subsidies for farmers' markets or community gardens.
6. Foster supportive communities: Deep poverty individuals often lack social support networks, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and disconnection. Policymakers can work towards fostering more supportive communities by investing in programs that bring people together and promote social connections.
7. Advocate for cash transfer programs: Cash transfer programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the US, can provide immediate financial assistance to deep poverty individuals. Policymakers can advocate for the expansion of these programs and work towards making them more accessible
