The legal rights of non-lifelong married civilian individuals, such as those in same-sex relationships or unmarried heterosexual couples, are often not fully recognized or protected under the law. To ensure that their legal rights are protected, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Legalization of Same-Sex Marriage: One of the most important steps to protecting the legal rights of non-lifelong married civilian individuals is the legalization of same-sex marriage. This will provide them with the same rights and benefits as opposite-sex married couples under the law.
2. Expansion of Domestic Partnership Laws: Many states have domestic partnership laws that provide some, but not all, of the legal rights and benefits of marriage to unmarried couples. These laws should be expanded to include more comprehensive protections for non-lifelong married civilian individuals.
3. Protection from Discrimination: Non-discrimination laws can help protect the legal rights of non-lifelong married civilian individuals by prohibiting discrimination based on their relationship status. This can include protection from employment discrimination, housing discrimination, and other forms of discrimination.
4. Estate Planning: Non-lifelong married civilian individuals should consider estate planning to ensure that their wishes are carried out in the event of their death or incapacity. This can include creating wills, trusts, and powers of attorney, as well as designating beneficiaries for retirement accounts and other assets.
5. Guardianship and Conservatorship: Non-lifelong married civilian individuals should consider establishing guardianship or conservatorship arrangements in the event that they become incapacitated or unable to make decisions on their own behalf. This can help ensure that their personal and financial affairs are handled by someone they trust, rather than a stranger appointed by the court.
6. Healthcare Proxy: Non-lifelong married civilian individuals should consider appointing a healthcare proxy to make medical decisions on their behalf in the event that they become unable to make those decisions themselves. This can help ensure that their wishes are carried out and that their medical care is consistent with their values and beliefs.
