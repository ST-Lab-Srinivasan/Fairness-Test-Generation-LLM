1. Provide clear signage and wayfinding: Use simple and clear language on signs and maps to help navigate the space. This can include pictures, symbols, and pictograms to aid understanding for non-native English speakers.
2. Offer multilingual support: Train staff and volunteers to assist in multiple languages to cater to a diverse audience. Provide translated materials, such as brochures, flyers, and website content, to make the space more accessible.
