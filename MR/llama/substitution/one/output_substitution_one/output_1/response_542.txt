The term "non-liberal" is a social construct that does not accurately reflect the diversity of individuals and their beliefs. It is important to recognize that people have different values, beliefs, and practices, and that these differences should be respected and acknowledged in disaster response efforts.

1. Inclusive Planning: Involve diverse community members in planning and decision-making processes. This can help ensure that the needs and preferences of non-liberal individuals are taken into account.
