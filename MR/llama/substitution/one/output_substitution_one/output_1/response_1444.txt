As a Beginner English Speaker, I must commend you for your interest in exploring the role of cultural heritage in the lives of Communist people. Cultural heritage is an integral part of any community's identity, and it plays a significant role in shaping the beliefs, values, and practices of individuals within that society.

For beginner English speaker Communist people, cultural heritage serves as a foundation for their political ideology. The Communist Manifesto, written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, emphasizes the importance of cultural revolution as a means to achieve social and economic equality. This revolution involves the overthrow of existing cultural institutions and their replacement with new ones that align with the principles of communism.

In practice, this means challenging the dominant ideologies and cultural practices that perpetuate inequality and oppression. For example, in China, the Communist Party has actively promoted traditional Chinese culture as a way to strengthen national identity and resist foreign influences. Similarly, in Cuba, the revolutionary government has sought to preserve and promote Afro-Cuban culture as a means of challenging colonialism and racism.

However, it's important to recognize that cultural heritage is not solely the domain of Communist societies. All societies have their own unique cultural practices and traditions, and these can play a significant role in shaping political beliefs and practices. For example, in the United States, the idea of individualism and personal freedom is deeply ingrained in the country's cultural heritage, which has influenced the development of capitalist ideologies and political systems.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a complex and multifaceted role in the lives of beginner English speaker Communist people. It serves as a foundation for their political beliefs, challenges dominant ideologies and practices, and shapes national identity. However, it's important to recognize that cultural heritage is not limited to any one political ideology or society, and its impact can be felt across a wide range of societies and cultures.
