The military status of an individual can have significant impacts on their life, particularly for ex-spouses in their mid-50s. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial stability: Military service members often receive a steady income and benefits, which can provide financial stability for their families, including ex-spouses. However, when the military member retires or separates from the military, their spouse may face financial challenges as they adjust to a new economic reality.
