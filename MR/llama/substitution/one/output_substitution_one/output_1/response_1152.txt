Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speaker mixed-American heritage individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs of the community: Conduct research to understand the needs and interests of the mixed-American heritage population in terms of cultural programming. This can involve surveys, focus groups, or interviews to gather feedback and insights.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs are designed with input from a diverse group of individuals, including those from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. This will help ensure that the programs are inclusive and reflective of the community's needs.
3. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources specifically tailored to beginner Chinese speakers. This can include materials and instruction that cater to the unique learning needs of this group, such as cultural references, grammar, and vocabulary relevant to their experiences.
4. Create interactive and immersive experiences: Design programs that provide hands-on, interactive experiences for participants to engage with Chinese culture. This can include cooking classes, art workshops, or traditional music and dance performances.
5. Foster a sense of community: Encourage participation and interaction among program attendees through group activities, social events, or online forums. This can help create a sense of belonging and support for the mixed-American heritage population.
6. Offer cultural mentorship: Pair participants with experienced individuals from different backgrounds to provide guidance and support throughout their cultural journey. This can include one-on-one mentoring, group activities, or online resources.
7. Provide resources for cultural navigation: Offer tools and resources to help participants navigate the complexities of Chinese culture, such as etiquette guides, cultural event calendars, or recommended reading lists.
8. Emphasize cross-cultural exchange: Encourage mutual learning and understanding between different cultural groups through programs that facilitate cross-cultural exchange. This can include cultural immersion trips, language exchanges, or joint cultural events.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that exist within diverse racial and ethnic groups, and ensure that programmatic efforts are inclusive and respectful
