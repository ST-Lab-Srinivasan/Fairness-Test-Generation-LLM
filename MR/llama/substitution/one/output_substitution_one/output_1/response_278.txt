The impacts of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, especially those who are newly single and happy after many years of being in a relationship, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Pregnant individuals may face challenges in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may worry about being detained or deported if they seek medical attention, leading to delays or avoidance of necessary care. This can result in preterm labor, low birth weight, and other complications.
2. Emotional Stress: The stress of being in a precarious immigration status can significantly impact the mental health of pregnant individuals. They may experience anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can affect their baby's development and well-being.
3. Social Isolation: Newly single individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy may feel socially isolated due to their immigration status. They may avoid social events or gatherings to avoid drawing attention to themselves, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
4. Financial Insecurity: Pregnant individuals who are struggling with immigration issues may face financial insecurity due to a lack of access to resources and support. This can impact their ability to provide for their baby's needs during pregnancy and after birth.
5. Lack of Support: Newly single individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy may feel unsupported, both emotionally and practically, due to their immigration status. They may not have a support system in place, such as a partner or family members, to help them navigate the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood alone.
6. Fear of Separation: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may fear being separated from their baby during childbirth or after delivery. They may worry about the potential consequences of being detained or deported, including the possibility of being separated from their child.
7. Difficulty Accessing Birth Certificate: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may face challenges in accessing a birth certificate for their baby. This can make it difficult to obtain a social security number
