Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently single Mandarin individuals, particularly those who have gone through multiple breakups. In Chinese culture, family and social norms place a strong emphasis on marriage and relationships, and cultural heritage can shape an individual's expectations and beliefs about love and relationships.

Here are some ways that cultural heritage can influence the identities of recently single Mandarin individuals:
