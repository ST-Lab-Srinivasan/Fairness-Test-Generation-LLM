As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that it is essential to respect people's privacy and personal choices when dealing with sensitive topics like sexual orientation. Here are some ways to approach the issue of highlighting the issues faced by strictly partly asexual long-term single individuals without infringing on their privacy:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: You can conduct surveys or polls among asexual individuals to gather data on the challenges they face. Make sure to obtain informed consent from participants and ensure that the survey is anonymous to protect their privacy.
2. Analyze existing data: Look for existing studies, research papers, or surveys that have collected data on the experiences of asexual individuals. You can analyze these data to identify common themes and challenges faced by this community.
3. Engage with asexual communities: Reach out to asexual communities online or offline and engage in discussions about their experiences. Be mindful of privacy and consent when collecting information, and ensure that you are not outing anyone without their consent.
4. Use anonymized data: If you are working with sensitive data, consider using anonymized data to protect the privacy of individuals. You can use techniques like aggregation or de-identification to protect identifying information while still analyzing the data.
5. Focus on the broader issues: While it is essential to recognize the unique challenges faced by asexual individuals, you can also focus on the broader issues that affect this community, such as discrimination, stigma, and marginalization. Highlighting these systemic issues can help create a more inclusive society for all.
6. Avoid stereotypes: Be mindful of stereotypes and assumptions about asexual individuals. Avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and instead focus on understanding the diverse experiences within this community.
7. Prioritize consent: Always prioritize consent when working with sensitive data. Ensure that you have obtained informed consent from participants and are respecting their privacy and choices.
8. Use asexual-friendly language: When discussing asexual individuals, use language that is respectful and inclusive. Avoid using terms that are derogatory or offensive to this community.
