Creating more inclusive cultural programs for nominal Hindu moderate-income individuals requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct surveys or focus groups to understand the interests, values, and preferences of the nominal Hindu moderate-income individuals. This will help tailor the cultural programs to meet their specific needs.
2. Provide accessibility: Make sure that the cultural programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic status. Offer subsidies or discounts for tickets or memberships to make them more affordable for moderate-income individuals.
3. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the community by incorporating different perspectives, voices, and art forms. This can be achieved by collaborating with artists from different backgrounds or showcasing works that represent the community's rich cultural heritage.
4. Offer educational programs: Develop educational programs that provide an opportunity for moderate-income individuals to learn about Hindu culture, history, and traditions. This can help them appreciate and enjoy the cultural programs more fully.
5. Create a sense of belonging: Foster a sense of community among the target audience by creating opportunities for them to connect with each other and with the cultural organization. This can be achieved through events, workshops, or social gatherings that promote social interaction and collaboration.
6. Provide cultural immersion experiences: Offer cultural immersion experiences that allow moderate-income individuals to fully immerse themselves in Hindu culture. This can include study trips to India, cultural exchange programs, or workshops on traditional Hindu arts and crafts.
7. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms to reach a wider audience and make cultural programs more accessible. For example, live-streaming events or creating online courses that teach Hindu culture and traditions can help moderate-income individuals participate in the cultural programs from the comfort of their own homes.
8. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with other organizations that serve the same target audience to create more comprehensive and inclusive cultural programs. This can help leverage resources, expertise, and networks to reach a wider audience.
