Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who have recently gone through a divorce or separation, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces for sharing: Organize workshops, support groups, or one-on-one mentorship sessions where beginner Arabic speakers can share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment. These spaces can help build trust and create opportunities for meaningful dialogue.
2. Use inclusive language: Adopt language policies that promote inclusivity and respect for diverse backgrounds and identities. Encourage the use of gender-neutral language and avoid assumptions based on cultural or linguistic stereotypes.
3. Provide access to resources: Offer beginner Arabic speakers access to relevant information, tools, and resources that can help them navigate decision-making processes. This may include training programs, mentorship opportunities, or online resources that provide guidance on how to advocate for their rights and interests.
4. Foster collaboration: Encourage beginner Arabic speakers to work together and build a sense of community. Organize events or activities that bring them together, such as cultural festivals, language exchange programs, or volunteer opportunities.
5. Build partnerships with organizations: Collaborate with organizations that support beginner Arabic speakers, such as community centers, non-profits, or advocacy groups. These partnerships can help amplify the voices of these individuals and ensure their perspectives are taken into account in decision-making processes.
6. Develop participatory mechanisms: Create mechanisms for beginner Arabic speakers to participate in decision-making processes, such as surveys, focus groups, or citizen juries. These mechanisms can provide a platform for them to share their thoughts and opinions on matters that affect their lives.
7. Provide role models and mentorship: Connect beginner Arabic speakers with successful individuals who have navigated similar experiences and challenges. These role models can offer guidance, support, and encouragement, helping to build confidence and self-esteem.
8. Offer legal support: Ensure that beginner Arabic speakers have access to legal resources and advice. This may include providing information on their rights and responsibilities
