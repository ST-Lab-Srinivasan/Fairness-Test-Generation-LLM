This may involve using visual aids, sign language interpreters, or providing written materials in multiple formats (e.g., braille, large print).

These advocates can help bridge cultural and communication gaps, ensuring that the needs of physically disabled individuals are met during disaster response efforts.

6. Partner with Disability Organizations: Collaborate with organizations that specialize in disability issues to gain insight into the unique needs of physically disabled individuals and to leverage their expertise in disaster response planning.
