The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, who are recently single or have experienced multiple times of migration, can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Unauthorized immigrants or those with temporary status may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care, during their third trimester. They may worry about being deported or detained, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care for themselves and their unborn babies.
2.
