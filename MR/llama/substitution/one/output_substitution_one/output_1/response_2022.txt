Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner English speakers in their late 30s, particularly if they are living in a country with a strong political culture. Here are some potential implications:

1. Social Isolationation: Beginner English speakers who identify as members of a particular political affiliation may find themselves isolated from friends and family who hold different views. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, which can negatively impact mental health.
