Promoting the artistic expression of elderly male non-middle-class individuals can be a challenging task, but there are several ways to support and encourage these individuals to express themselves creatively. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide access to resources: Many elderly individuals may not have the means or access to art supplies, musical instruments, or other creative tools. Consider providing resources such as paint, canvases, musical instruments, or even just basic art supplies like paper and pencils.
2. Create a supportive community: Connecting elderly individuals with others who share similar interests and abilities can help foster a sense of belonging and motivation to create. Consider organizing art classes or workshops specifically for elderly males, or even just hosting regular gatherings where they can share their creations and receive feedback from others.
3. Encourage intergenerational collaboration: Collaborating with younger individuals can provide new perspectives and ideas for the elderly artists, while also providing an opportunity for the younger generation to learn from the wisdom and experience of the older individuals. Consider organizing workshops or projects where elderly and younger individuals can work together on creative projects.
4. Showcase their work: Elderly individuals may feel overlooked or undervalued, so showcasing their artistic expression can help validate their contributions and provide a sense of purpose. Consider hosting exhibitions or events specifically to showcase the artwork of elderly males, or even just displaying their work in public spaces where it can be appreciated by a wider audience.
5. Provide opportunities for self-expression: Many elderly individuals may feel that they have lost touch with their creative selves over time. Consider providing opportunities for self-expression through art, music, writing, or other creative outlets. This can help them reconnect with their inner selves and find a sense of purpose and fulfillment.
6. Address social isolation: Social isolation can be a major challenge for elderly individuals, particularly those living alone. Consider organizing activities that bring elderly males together in a social setting, such as art classes, workshops, or even just regular gatherings where they can share their experiences and creations with others.
7. Provide mentorship: Mentorship can be a powerful tool for fostering creativity
