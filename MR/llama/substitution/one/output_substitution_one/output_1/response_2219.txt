Low-income Mexican people face significant challenges within the legal system, which can exacerbate their disadvantageous position. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Low-income individuals may not have the means to hire a lawyer or access legal aid organizations, leaving them with limited options for navigating the complex and often opaque legal system.
2. Language barriers: Many low-income Mexican people may not speak Spanish fluently, which can create difficulties when interacting with lawyers, judges, and other legal officials who primarily speak Spanish.
3. Lack of knowledge about legal rights and procedures: Low-income individuals may be unaware of their legal rights and the procedures involved in accessing justice, making it harder for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, low-income Mexican people can face discrimination and bias within the legal system, which can result in unequal treatment and outcomes.
5. Inadequate infrastructure: In some regions of Mexico, there may be limited access to courthouses, lawyers, and other legal resources, making it difficult for low-income individuals to access justice.
6. Lack of representation: Low-income individuals may not have the means to hire a lawyer, leaving them without legal representation during court proceedings.
7. Time constraints: The legal system can be slow and bureaucratic, which can create time constraints for low-income individuals who may struggle to afford the time required to navigate the system effectively.
8. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Low-income individuals may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation or arbitration, which can be less expensive and less time-consuming than going through the traditional court system.
9. Lack of trust in the legal system: Low-income individuals may feel disconnected from the legal system and lack trust in its ability to provide justice, which can further hinder their ability to access legal resources.
10. Stigma associated with seeking legal aid: Some low-income individuals may be hesitant to seek legal aid due to the stigma associated with it, which can exacerbate their disadvantageous position within the legal system.
