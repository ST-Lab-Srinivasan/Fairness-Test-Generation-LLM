As a language model, I can provide some general insights and potential challenges that Mandarin-not-recently-single people may face in the job market. Please note that these challenges can vary depending on individual circumstances and cultural contexts. Here are some possible challenges:

1. Language barrier: For Mandarin speakers who have not been single recently, they may face difficulties in communicating effectively in English or other languages used in the workplace, particularly if their proficiency in these languages is limited.
2. Cultural differences: Mandarin speakers may find it challenging to adapt to different work cultures and customs, especially if they are not familiar with them. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, or unintentional offense.
3. Stereotyping and bias: Unfortunately, there are still some biases and stereotypes associated with Mandarin speakers, particularly in the workplace. These can impact how they are perceived and treated by colleagues and supervisors.
4. Lack of relevant experience: Depending on their individual circumstances, Mandarin-not-recently-single people may not have had the opportunity to gain experience in certain areas, such as networking or professional development. This can make it more difficult for them to compete with others in the job market.
5. Different expectations: Single people may have different social and cultural norms than those who are not single. For example, they may be more focused on their personal lives and social interactions outside of work, which can lead to different expectations and priorities in the workplace.
6. Balancing work and personal life: As Mandarin speakers get older, they may face additional challenges balancing their work and personal lives. This can be particularly true if they have children or other family responsibilities that require attention and care.
7. Limited job opportunities: Depending on their location and circumstances, Mandarin-not-recently-single people may face limited job opportunities or be relegated to certain types of jobs due to language barriers or cultural differences.
8. Lack of mentorship and support: Single people may not have the same level of access to mentorship and support networks as their peers who are married or in relationships. This can impact their career advancement and overall well-being
