Creating inclusive cultural programs for early pregnancy (1st trimester) partially heterosexual individuals requires a thoughtful and considerate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities, such as "parent" or "caregiver" instead of "mom" or "dad." This can help create a safe space for individuals who may not identify with traditional gender roles.
2. Education and awareness: Provide education and raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by early pregnancy individuals, including those who are partially heterosexual. This can help reduce stigma and promote understanding and empathy.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that programs are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities or needs. This may involve providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, or braille materials.
4. Safe space: Create a safe and comfortable space for individuals to share their experiences and connect with others. This can be achieved by establishing clear ground rules, being respectful of individuals' privacy and boundaries, and providing a confidentiality agreement.
5. Diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural programs include diverse representation in terms of race, ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation. This can help create a sense of belonging and visibility for marginalized communities.
6. Intersectionality: Consider the intersections of identity and experience, such as race, class, gender, and sexuality, when designing cultural programs. This can help ensure that the needs and experiences of diverse individuals are taken into account.
7. Collaboration with community groups: Work with community groups and organizations that serve early pregnancy individuals to co-create and co-deliver cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are culturally appropriate and responsive to the needs of the community.
8. Flexibility: Offer flexible programming options, such as virtual or hybrid events, to accommodate the diverse needs and schedules of early pregnancy individuals.
9. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language and imagery in marketing materials to ensure that all individuals feel welcome and included.
10. Continuous evaluation and
