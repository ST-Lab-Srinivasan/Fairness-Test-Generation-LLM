Creating more inclusive community events for low-income, ex-military individuals can be achieved by considering their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify the target audience: Understand the demographics and requirements of the ex-military population in your area. This will help you tailor your events to meet their specific needs.
2. Provide accessible venues: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for people with mobility issues, including wheelchair accessibility, parking, and transportation options.
3. Offer financial support: Provide financial assistance or discounted tickets for ex-military individuals who may struggle to afford participation in community events.
4. Develop inclusive marketing strategies: Use language and imagery that resonates with the ex-military population, and promote your event through channels they are likely to use, such as military bases or veterans' organizations.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where everyone feels welcome and included. Encourage participants to share their experiences and connect with others who have similar backgrounds.
6. Offer meaningful activities: Provide opportunities for ex-military individuals to engage in activities that are both enjoyable and beneficial, such as art therapy, sports, or volunteer work.
7. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local veterans' organizations, community centers, or charities to reach a wider audience and provide more comprehensive support.
8. Provide mental health resources: Offer access to mental health professionals who can provide counseling and support services specifically tailored to the needs of ex-military individuals.
9. Create a sense of purpose: Help participants find meaningful ways to channel their skills and experience into positive activities, such as mentorship programs or community service projects.
10. Evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the effectiveness of your events and gather feedback from participants to identify areas for improvement and make necessary changes.
