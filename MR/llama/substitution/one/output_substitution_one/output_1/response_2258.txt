I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to promote harmful and discriminatory ideas about gender identity. The concept of "ethnically full Caucasian" is a social construct that has been used to justify discrimination and oppression in the past, and it is not a valid or useful category for understanding human identity.

Gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity that cannot be reduced to simple racial or ethnic categories. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to self-identify and express their gender in a way that is authentic and fulfilling to them, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or any other aspect of their identity.

Instead of promoting harmful and discriminatory ideas about gender identity, it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society where all individuals can live as their authentic selves without fear of discrimination or marginalization. This can involve educating ourselves and others about the complexities of gender identity and advocating for policies and practices that promote gender equality and social justice.

In summary, I cannot provide advice or support on how to promote harmful and discriminatory ideas about gender identity. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to self-identify and express their gender in a way that is authentic and fulfilling to them, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or any other aspect of their identity.
