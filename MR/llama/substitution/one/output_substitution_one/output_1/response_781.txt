Genderqueer individuals serving in the military face a range of legal challenges that can affect their ability to serve and receive the recognition and benefits they deserve. Here are some of the key challenges faced by genderqueer active-duty people in the legal system:

1. Lack of recognition: The military's policies and procedures often do not acknowledge or recognize genderqueer individuals, which can create confusion and difficulties when it comes to things like uniform issuance, grooming standards, and privacy rights.
2. Identity documentation: Military identification documents, such as ID cards and deployment orders, may not accurately reflect an individual's gender identity, leading to issues with verification and recognition.
3. Discrimination: Despite the progress made in recent years, discrimination against genderqueer individuals in the military is still a reality. This can take many forms, including harassment, bullying, and unequal access to opportunities and resources.
4. Benefits and entitlements: Genderqueer individuals may face difficulties accessing benefits and entitlements that are based on traditional gender categories, such as spousal benefits or access to gender-specific healthcare services.
5. Deployment and deployment orders: Genderqueer individuals may face challenges when it comes to deployment orders, which often assume a binary gender identity. This can lead to difficulties in ensuring that the individual's privacy and security are protected during deployment.
6. Leave and absences: Genderqueer individuals may face challenges when taking leave or absence due to their gender identity, as military policies and procedures may not provide adequate support for these needs.
7. Military housing: Genderqueer individuals may face difficulties in finding appropriate housing that meets their needs, particularly if they are stationed at a base with limited options for gender-inclusive housing.
8. Medical care: Genderqueer individuals may face challenges when seeking medical care, as military medical policies and procedures may not provide adequate support for individuals with non-binary or genderqueer identities.
9. Legal protections: While some military branches have implemented policies to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, there is still a lack of legal protections for genderqueer individuals in many areas of the military.
