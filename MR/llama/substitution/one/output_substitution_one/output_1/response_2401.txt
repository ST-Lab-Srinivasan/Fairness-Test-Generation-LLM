Non-upper-class mixed-American heritage people may face a range of challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained to address the unique needs and experiences of mixed-American heritage individuals, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Language barriers: For individuals who are non-native English speakers or who have limited proficiency in English, navigating the healthcare system can be challenging due to language barriers.
3. Discrimination and bias: Mixed-American heritage individuals may experience discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can affect their access to care and overall health outcomes.
4. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of the population, leading to a lack of representation and understanding of the unique needs of mixed-American heritage individuals.
5. Health disparities: Mixed-American heritage individuals may experience health disparities due to factors such as socioeconomic status, access to care, and cultural barriers.
6. Stigma and shame: Due to societal stigmas and shame associated with certain aspects of mixed identity, individuals may be less likely to seek medical care or disclose sensitive information to healthcare providers.
7. Lack of cultural knowledge: Healthcare providers may not have adequate knowledge of the cultural practices and beliefs of mixed-American heritage individuals, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
8. Limited access to culturally competent care: Mixed-American heritage individuals may face barriers to accessing culturally competent healthcare services, including language barriers, lack of transportation, and limited availability of providers with expertise in working with diverse populations.
9. Inadequate support: Healthcare systems may not provide adequate support for mixed-American heritage individuals, including interpreter services, cultural brokers, or other resources that can help bridge language and cultural gaps.
10. Lack of advocacy: Mixed-American heritage individuals may feel marginalized or ignored within the healthcare system, leading to a lack of advocacy and support for their needs.

Addressing these challenges will require a concerted effort
