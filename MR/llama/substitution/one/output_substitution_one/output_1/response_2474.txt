Highlighting the achievements of non-single, long-term residents is important to recognize their contributions to the community and to combat negative stereotypes associated with being a "long-term resident." Here are some ways to highlight their achievements:

1. Create a "Resident of the Year" award: Choose a resident who has made significant contributions to the community and present them with an award. This can be done through a vote by the residents or by a panel of judges.
2. Host a community event: Organize a community event, such as a potluck dinner or a town hall meeting, where long-term residents can come together and share their experiences and achievements.
3. Create a "Resident Spotlight" section on the building's website or bulletin board: Highlight the achievements of different residents each month or quarter by featuring them in a "Resident Spotlight" section.
4. Offer recognition through the building's management: Work with the building's management to recognize and reward long-term residents for their contributions to the community.
5. Create a mentorship program: Pair long-term residents with newer residents who could benefit from their experience and knowledge, providing an opportunity for both parties to learn and grow.
6. Offer language classes or cultural events: Provide opportunities for long-term residents to share their language skills or cultural traditions with the rest of the community.
7. Create a "Resident History" project: Encourage long-term residents to share their stories and experiences by creating a "Resident History" project that can be displayed in the building or shared with the wider community.
8. Offer training and professional development opportunities: Provide opportunities for long-term residents to develop new skills or enhance existing ones, such as through workshops or training sessions.
9. Create a "Resident of the Month" feature: Highlight one resident each month who has made significant contributions to the community, either through volunteering or other forms of engagement.
10. Hold a resident appreciation event: Organize an event to recognize and appreciate the contributions of long-term residents, such as a potluck dinner or a small ceremony.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively highlight the achievements of non-single, long-term residents
