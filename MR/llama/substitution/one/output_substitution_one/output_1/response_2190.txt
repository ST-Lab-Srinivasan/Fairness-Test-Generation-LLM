Addressing the needs of physically disabled Native American recent refugees to the US during disaster responses requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that considers their unique cultural, social, and physical needs. Here are some key considerations:

1. Cultural Competency: Disaster response teams should be trained in cultural competency to better understand the values, beliefs, and practices of Native American communities. This includes recognizing the importance of traditional healing practices and incorporating them into disaster response efforts.

Training for Disability Awareness: Provide training on disability awareness and inclusion for all disaster response personnel, including law enforcement, emergency medical services, and relief workers. This can help ensure that individuals with disabilities are treated with respect and dignity during disaster responses.
