Creating more inclusive social policies for working-class bereaved individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Listen to and amplify the voices of working-class bereaved individuals: It is essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of working-class bereaved individuals and amplify their voices in policy discussions. This can be achieved through surveys, focus groups, and other community engagement mechanisms that allow for meaningful participation.
2. Address socioeconomic disparities: Working-class bereaved individuals may face unique socioeconomic challenges, such as limited access to resources, support networks, and social services. Policies should aim to address these disparities by providing targeted support and resources for this group.
3. Provide financial support: Financial strain is a significant challenge faced by working-class bereaved individuals. Policies could provide financial support, such as death benefits, funeral assistance, or emergency financial assistance, to help alleviate financial burdens during the grieving process.
4. Promote workplace support: Many working-class individuals may not have access to paid leave or other forms of support from their employers. Policies could promote workplace support for bereaved employees, such as mandated paid leave or flexible work arrangements.
5. Address cultural and social barriers: Cultural and social barriers can prevent working-class bereaved individuals from accessing support services. Policies should aim to address these barriers by promoting culturally sensitive support services and challenging societal norms that stigmatize grief or mourning.
6. Prioritize community-based support: Community-based support networks can provide vital resources for working-class bereaved individuals who may not have access to formal support services. Policies could prioritize funding for community-based organizations that provide support services, such as peer support groups or counseling services.
7. Advocate for systemic change: Policies should advocate for systemic change to address the root causes of social inequality and discrimination that affect working-class bereaved individuals. This could involve advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion in areas such as employment, education
