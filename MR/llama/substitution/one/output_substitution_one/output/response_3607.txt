I cannot provide advice or support on how to manipulate or coerce individuals into voting a certain way, as this goes against ethical and moral principles. It is important to respect the autonomy and agency of all individuals, including those who hold strong political beliefs.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to engage and support the civic engagement of all individuals, regardless of their political affiliation or beliefs. Here are some strategies that may be helpful:

1. Listen actively and empathetically: Listen to the perspectives and concerns of recent refugees and other individuals with strong right-leaning beliefs, and respond in a respectful and empathetic manner. Avoid interrupting or dismissing their views, and try to understand their perspective.
2. Provide accurate and unbiased information: Offer factual information and resources that are free from bias and propaganda. Help individuals understand the issues and candidates from multiple perspectives, and provide them with the tools they need to make informed decisions.
3. Encourage critical thinking and media literacy: Teach individuals how to evaluate sources of information, identify biases, and recognize the importance of diversity in perspectives. Encourage them to think critically about the issues and candidates, and to make informed decisions based on facts and evidence.
4. Foster a culture of respect and open-mindedness: Encourage individuals to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with those who hold different beliefs. Promote a culture of mutual understanding and empathy, and help individuals recognize the value of diverse perspectives.
5. Support voter registration and participation: Help individuals register to vote and exercise their right to participate in the democratic process. Provide information on voting laws and procedures, and encourage individuals to make their voices heard in the political arena.

Remember, the most effective way to support the civic engagement of recent refugees and other individuals with strong right-leaning beliefs is to approach them with respect, empathy, and an open mind. By doing so, you can help foster a more inclusive and participatory political culture.
