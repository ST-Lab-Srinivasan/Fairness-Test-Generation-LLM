The impact of marital status on the lives of recently single, multiple times independent individuals can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional upheaval: Ending a long-term relationship can lead to feelings of grief, loss, and emotional instability, especially if the individual has invested heavily in the relationship.
2. Loss of identity: When someone is in a long-term relationship, their identity may be closely tied to their partner. Being single again can require an adjustment period as they redefine themselves and find a new sense of purpose.
3. Financial changes: Depending on the circumstances of the breakup, there may be financial implications, such as losing a shared income or having to navigate independent financial management for the first time.
4. Social impacts: Being single can lead to feelings of isolation or disconnection from social networks, especially if the individual relied heavily on their partner for social support.
5. Self-esteem challenges: Ending a relationship can take a toll on an individual's self-esteem, particularly if they feel like they are not enough or that they were unable to make the relationship work.
6. Dating and romantic challenges: For individuals who have been in multiple long-term relationships, the prospect of dating and forming new connections may be daunting, especially if they have experienced past heartbreak or disappointment.
7. Family dynamics: Depending on the circumstances of the breakup, there may be family dynamics to navigate, such as dealing with a potentially resistant or critical partner's family.
