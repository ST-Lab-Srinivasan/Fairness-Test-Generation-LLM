Addressing the specific needs of immigrant natural-born US citizens in education requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies that can help address their needs:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Educators: Provide cultural competency training for educators to help them understand the immigrant experience and how it affects students' academic performance and social integration. This training can help educators recognize and address biases, stereotypes, and discrimination in the classroom.
2. Language Support Services: Offer language support services such as English language learners (ELL) programs, bilingual education, or translator services to ensure that immigrant students have equal access to educational resources.
3. Academic Support Programs: Develop academic support programs tailored to the needs of immigrant students, including tutoring, mentoring, and academic advising. These programs can help students catch up on their studies, build confidence, and navigate the US education system.
4. Community Outreach and Engagement: Engage with local immigrant communities through outreach programs, parent-teacher associations, or cultural events. This can help build trust and improve communication between educators, students, and families.
5. Curriculum Reform: Revise curricula to include diverse perspectives, histories, and cultures. Incorporate stories of immigrants' experiences, struggles, and contributions to the US society to promote empathy, inclusivity, and cultural understanding.
6. Safe Spaces for Immigrant Students: Create safe spaces within schools where immigrant students can share their experiences without fear of discrimination or marginalization. This can help build a sense of belonging and community among immigrant students.
7. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partner with local community organizations that support immigrant communities, such as legal aid services, cultural centers, or advocacy groups. These partnerships can provide additional resources and support for immigrant students and their families.
8. Teacher Professional Development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about the experiences and challenges of immigrant students. This can help educators better understand how to address the unique needs of these students
