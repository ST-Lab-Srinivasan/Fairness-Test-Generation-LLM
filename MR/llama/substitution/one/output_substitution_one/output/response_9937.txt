The impact of marital status on the lives of native Spanish-speaking cisgender elderly male individuals can vary significantly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Marital status can affect an individual's social life, particularly in communities where marriage is highly valued. Elderly cisgender men who are not married may experience social isolation or feel left out of social events and activities.
2. Health disparities: Research has shown that marital status can impact health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, depression, and cognitive decline. Elderly cisgender men who are not married may be at higher risk for these health problems due to a lack of social support or resources.
3. Economic challenges: Marital status can also impact an individual's economic security in old age. Elderly cisgender men who are not married may have lower levels of wealth and income compared to their married counterparts, which can limit their access to healthcare, retirement benefits, and other resources.
