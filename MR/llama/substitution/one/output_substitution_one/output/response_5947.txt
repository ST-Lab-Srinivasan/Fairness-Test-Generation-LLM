The term "ethnically full" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in societal discourse, and it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserve equal economic opportunities and empowerment. Rather than focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it is more inclusive and equitable to prioritize policies and practices that promote economic empowerment for all individuals, regardless of their background.

Here are some ways to support the economic empowerment of upper middle-income individuals in the United States:

1. Invest in education and job training programs: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that can help individuals acquire new skills and advance in their careers, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
2. Promote access to affordable housing: Ensure that there are adequate affordable housing options available to all individuals, including those from lower-income backgrounds, to help them build wealth and achieve financial stability.
3. Support small business development: Encourage and support the growth of small businesses owned by individuals from underrepresented groups, through access to capital, mentorship, and other resources.
4. Implement progressive taxation policies: Implement tax policies that promote fairness and equity, such as increasing the tax burden on higher-income earners, and using the revenue generated to fund social programs that benefit lower- and moderate-income individuals.
5. Advocate for anti-discrimination policies: Advocate for policies that protect individuals from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or other factors, to ensure that everyone has equal access to economic opportunities.
6. Invest in community development programs: Invest in programs that support the economic development of underserved communities, such as microfinance initiatives, job creation programs, and infrastructure development projects.
7. Promote access to healthcare: Ensure that all individuals have access to quality, affordable healthcare, which can help them avoid medical debt and build wealth over time.
8. Encourage corporate social responsibility: Encourage businesses to adopt socially responsible practices, such as hiring from underrepresented groups, investing in local communities, and supporting diversity and inclusion initiatives.
