6. Use technology: Leverage digital resources, such as language learning apps, to supplement traditional teaching methods and make learning more accessible and convenient.
7. Offer cultural immersion opportunities: Provide opportunities for students to interact with Spanish-speaking cultures through study abroad programs, cultural events, or hosting native speakers in the classroom.
8. Collaborate with other institutions: Work with local colleges, universities, or language schools to offer joint programs or courses that cater to the educational needs of beginner Spanish speakers.
