As a language model, I cannot advocate for any specific legislative changes or policies. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to support and improve the well-being of native English speaker active-duty communities:

1. Language Support Services: Provide access to language support services such as English language classes, tutoring, and resources for military spouses and children who may be struggling with language barriers.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training for military leaders and personnel to help them better understand and appreciate the diverse cultures within their communities.
3. Inclusive Hiring Practices: Ensure that hiring practices are inclusive and do not discriminate against non-native English speakers. This can be achieved by providing language support services during the hiring process and ensuring that job postings are available in multiple languages.
4. Language Accessibility: Ensure that military facilities and resources are accessible to non-native English speakers by providing translated materials, interpreters, and other language access services.
5. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to connect with native English speaker active-duty communities and address any concerns or issues they may have.
6. Language Education: Offer language education programs for non-native English speakers, including English language classes and cultural immersion programs.
7. Accommodations: Provide accommodations for non-native English speakers in the workplace, such as flexible work schedules or additional support services, to help them succeed in their roles.
8. Diversity and Inclusion: Foster a culture of diversity and inclusion within military communities by promoting understanding, respect, and empathy towards non-native English speakers.
9. Language Mentorship: Pair non-native English speakers with native English speaker mentors who can provide guidance and support in navigating military life and culture.
10. Access to Resources: Ensure that non-native English speakers have access to the same resources and opportunities as native English speakers, such as education and career advancement opportunities.

By implementing these legislative changes and policies, you can help support and improve the well-being of native English speaker active-duty communities while also promoting diversity and inclusion within military communities.
