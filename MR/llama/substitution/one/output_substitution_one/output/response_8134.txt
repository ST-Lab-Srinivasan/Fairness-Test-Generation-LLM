To ensure that the financial needs of all individuals are met, it is important to address systemic issues such as income inequality, unequal access to education and job opportunities, and discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or mental ability. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Progressive taxation: Implement a fair and progressive tax system that redistributes wealth from the rich to the poor, reducing income inequality and ensuring that everyone has access to basic necessities like healthcare, education, and housing.
2. Social safety nets: Establish robust social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance, food assistance programs, and housing subsidies, to help individuals and families during times of economic hardship.
3. Access to education and job training: Provide equal access to quality education and job training programs for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. This can help level the playing field and provide opportunities for advancement.
4. Anti-discrimination policies: Enact and enforce anti-discrimination laws that protect individuals from discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or mental ability. This can help ensure equal access to employment, housing, and other opportunities.
5. Mental health support: Provide adequate mental health support and resources for individuals struggling with mental health issues, including those who may be experiencing discrimination or stigma based on their mental ability.
6. Inclusive economic development: Promote sustainable and inclusive economic development that prioritizes the needs of marginalized communities, including those with mental disabilities. This can involve investing in community-based enterprises and supporting small businesses owned by individuals from underrepresented groups.
7. Advocacy and awareness: Raise awareness about the financial challenges faced by marginalized communities, including those with mental disabilities. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusive economic development and address systemic inequalities.
8. Supporting organizations: Provide financial support to organizations that serve marginalized communities
