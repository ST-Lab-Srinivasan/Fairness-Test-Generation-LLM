Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and empowerment of ethnically full Hispanic individuals aged over 90 years old (and over 85). Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and encouragement to help these individuals navigate various challenges and achieve their goals. Here are some ways mentorship can impact the development of ethnically full Hispanic advanced individuals over the age of 90:

1. Cultural identity and pride: Growing up in a society that often marginalizes or demeans one's cultural identity can be challenging for older Hispanic adults. Mentorship can provide a sense of belonging and pride in one's cultural heritage, helping individuals to feel more confident and self-assured.
2. Access to resources: Mentors can offer valuable connections and access to resources that might not be available otherwise. For example, they may know of job opportunities, educational programs, or community organizations that can help older Hispanic adults navigate their later years with dignity and purpose.
3. Emotional support: Aging can be a difficult and isolating experience, especially for those who have experienced discrimination or marginalization throughout their lives. Mentorship can provide emotional support and companionship, helping individuals to feel less lonely and more connected to their communities.
4. Practical skills and knowledge: Older Hispanic adults may face challenges related to health, transportation, or other daily tasks due to age-related decline or disability. Mentors can provide practical skills and knowledge, such as how to navigate public transportation or how to stay safe in the home, that can help individuals maintain their independence and quality of life.
5. Role models and inspiration: Mentors can serve as role models and sources of inspiration for older Hispanic adults, demonstrating what is possible through hard work, determination, and resilience. They can encourage individuals to pursue their passions and goals, even in later life, and provide a sense of purpose and direction.
6. Networking opportunities: Mentorship can facilitate networking opportunities between older Hispanic adults and other individuals in their community or field of interest. This can help build connections and relationships that may otherwise be difficult to establish due
