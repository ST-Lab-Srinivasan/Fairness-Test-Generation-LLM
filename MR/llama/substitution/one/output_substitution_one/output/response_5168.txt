7. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support specifically tailored to the needs of genderqueer or non-binary individuals in leadership roles. This could include access to mental health professionals, peer support groups, or counseling services.
8. Celebrate and recognize gender diversity: Organize events or activities that celebrate
