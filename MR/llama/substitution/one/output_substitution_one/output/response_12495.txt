7. Offer extra help: Offer extra help outside of class hours for students who are struggling to keep up with their coursework due to their grief.
8. Encourage self-care: Encourage bereaved students to prioritize self-care and engage in activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as yoga or meditation.
9. Involve the student in decision-making: Involve the student in decision-making processes related to their education, such as choosing assignments or projects, to help them feel more in control of their learning experience.
