To ensure that the housing needs of permanent residents who are late teenagers (18-19 years old) are met, several strategies can be implemented:

1. Increase the supply of affordable housing: Governments can provide incentives to developers to build more affordable housing units, including rental properties and homeownership opportunities. This can help reduce the cost of housing and make it more accessible to young people.
2. Provide financial assistance: Governments can offer financial assistance programs, such as low-interest loans or grants, to help young people purchase their first home. This can help bridge the gap between the cost of housing and their limited financial resources.
3. Encourage community land trusts: Community land trusts (CLTs) are nonprofit organizations that own land and lease it to homeowners at a reduced price. CLTs can provide affordable housing options for young people who may not be able to afford market-rate housing.
4. Develop inclusive zoning policies: Zoning policies can influence the type of housing that is built in a particular area. Governments can adopt inclusive zoning policies that allow for a mix of housing types, including rental properties and owner-occupied homes, to meet the diverse needs of young people.
5. Promote intergenerational transfer of wealth: Intergenerational transfer of wealth refers to the passing down of assets, including housing, from one generation to the next. Governments can encourage this by offering tax incentives or other forms of support for families who want to transfer their housing wealth to younger generations.
6. Encourage co-living: Co-living refers to shared living spaces that are designed to promote community and social interaction among residents. This can be an attractive option for young people who may not be able to afford a home of their own but want the benefits of living in a community with like-minded individuals.
7. Develop age-restricted housing: Age-restricted housing refers to housing that is designed specifically for older adults, including retirement communities and senior co-ops. Governments can encourage the development of age-restricted housing by offering incentives or subsidies to developers who build these types of properties.
8. Provide support services: Governments can provide support services
