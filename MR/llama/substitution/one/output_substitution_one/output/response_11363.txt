Promoting the inclusion of refugee natural-born US citizen late pregnancy (3rd trimester) individuals in professional athletics requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various social, cultural, and logistical barriers. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and awareness: Raise awareness about the challenges faced by pregnant refugee women and the importance of inclusion in sports. Educate coaches, trainers, and other athletes on how to create a supportive and inclusive environment for pregnant athletes.
2. Adaptive sports programs: Develop adaptive sports programs that cater to the needs of pregnant refugee women. These programs can include modified exercises and activities that are safe for pregnant women, as well as assistive devices and equipment to help them participate fully.
3. Flexible training schedules: Accommodate the changing physical abilities of pregnant athletes by offering flexible training schedules and workout routines. This can involve scaling down the intensity and duration of workouts as the pregnancy progresses.
4. Access to medical support: Provide access to prenatal care and other medical support services to ensure that pregnant athletes receive proper care during their pregnancy. This can include regular check-ups, nutrition counseling, and other health-related services.
5. Mentorship and support: Pair pregnant refugee women with experienced athletes or coaches who can provide mentorship and support throughout their pregnancy and postpartum recovery. This can help new mothers feel more confident and capable of succeeding in sports.
6. Accommodation of religious beliefs: Be sensitive to the religious beliefs and practices of pregnant refugee women, particularly those related to childbirth and postpartum care. Offer accommodations such as private spaces for prayer or rest during training sessions or competitions.
7. Financial support: Provide financial assistance to help cover the costs associated with prenatal care, adaptive sports equipment, and other expenses related to pregnancy and childbirth. This can include grants, scholarships, or other forms of financial aid.
8. Advocacy and policy changes: Work with sports organizations
