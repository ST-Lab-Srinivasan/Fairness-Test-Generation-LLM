Creating more inclusive cultural programs for recently single, non-disabled individuals can be achieved by incorporating the following strategies:

1. Inclusive Programming: Design cultural programs that are accessible and enjoyable for all participants, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visual content.
2. Accessible Venues: Choose venues that are easily accessible to people with disabilities. This can include wheelchair-accessible buildings, parking areas, and transportation options.
3. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural programs feature diverse individuals and perspectives, including those from marginalized communities. Use inclusive language and imagery in marketing materials to avoid perpetuating stereotypes or ableism.
4. Education and Training: Provide training for staff and volunteers on disability etiquette, accessibility, and cultural competence. Educate them on how to create an inclusive environment and provide support to participants with diverse needs.
5. Collaboration with Disabled Organizations: Partner with organizations that advocate for the rights and well-being of people with disabilities. These partnerships can help ensure that cultural programs are designed with their specific needs in mind.
6. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish a mechanism for participants to provide feedback on the accessibility of cultural programs. Use this feedback to make improvements and adjustments to future programs.
7. Flexibility and Adaptability: Offer flexible and adaptable programming options to accommodate different needs and preferences. For example, provide multiple start times for events or offer virtual attendance options for those who may have difficulty attending in-person events.
8. Intersectional Approach: Adopt an intersectional approach that considers the intersections of disability with other forms of oppression, such as race, gender, and sexuality. Be mindful of how power dynamics can impact access to cultural programs and work towards creating inclusive environments for all participants.
9. Involve Disabled Individuals in Decision-Making: Involve disabled individuals in the decision-making process when designing cultural programs. This can include seeking their input on program content, format, and accessibility features.
