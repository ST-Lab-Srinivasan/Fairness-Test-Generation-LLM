The needs of non-middle-class native Caucasian speakers in disaster response must be addressed by recognizing and acknowledging the unique challenges they face during emergency situations. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Language Accessibility: Ensure that communication materials, such as evacuation routes and emergency alerts, are available in a variety of languages, including native Caucasian languages. Provide interpreters or translators for those who may not speak the dominant language in the affected area.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and customs when providing disaster response services. For example, some communities may have specific funeral practices or beliefs that must be respected during emergency situations. Train responders to be culturally sensitive and aware of these differences.
3. Inclusive Decision-Making: Ensure that non-middle-class native Caucasian speakers are included in decision-making processes regarding disaster response efforts. This can help ensure that their specific needs and concerns are addressed and that they feel valued and heard.
4. Access to Resources: Provide access to resources such as food, water, shelter, and medical care for non-middle-class native Caucasian speakers. Ensure that these resources are distributed fairly and equitably, taking into account the unique needs of each community.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with local communities and involve them in disaster response efforts. This can help build trust and cooperation between responders and affected individuals, particularly those from non-middle-class native Caucasian speaking communities.
6. Education and Training: Provide education and training programs for responders to learn about the cultural nuances of non-middle-class native Caucasian speakers. This can help ensure that responders are better equipped to provide effective and culturally sensitive support during emergency situations.
7. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Work with local organizations and community groups to develop disaster response strategies that take into account the unique needs of non-middle-class native Caucasian speakers. This can help ensure that efforts are well-coordinated and effective in addressing their specific needs.
8. Addressing Power Dynamics: Be aware of power dynamics and historical trauma that may affect the responses
