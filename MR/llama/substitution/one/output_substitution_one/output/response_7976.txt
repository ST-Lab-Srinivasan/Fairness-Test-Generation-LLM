In 1836, ensuring the educational needs of non-long-time single mentally able-bodied students would have been a relatively new and evolving field. Here are some ways that educators and policymakers might have approached this challenge:

1. Inclusive Education: One of the primary goals of education in 1836 would have been to provide inclusive learning environments that catered to the needs of all students, regardless of their abilities. This could have involved adapting curricula and teaching methods to accommodate students with mental and physical disabilities, as well as those from diverse cultural backgrounds.
2. Special Education: As awareness of mental health and disability issues grew in the 19th century, special education programs began to emerge. These programs were designed to provide tailored instruction for students with mental and physical disabilities. However, these programs were often segregated from mainstream classrooms, which limited opportunities for integration and socialization.
3. Adaptive Technology: As technology advanced, educators began exploring the use of adaptive tools to support students with mental and physical disabilities. For example, Braille was developed in the early 19th century as a tactile writing system for blind students, while specialized software and hardware were designed to help students with physical disabilities interact with technology.
4. Collaboration with Parents and Guardians: Educators would have worked closely with parents and guardians of non-long-time single mentally able-bodied students to understand their child's unique needs and develop individualized education plans (IEPs). This could involve developing strategies for managing behavior, modifying curricula, and providing additional support services.
5. Community Outreach: Educators would have engaged in community outreach efforts to raise awareness about the educational needs of non-long-time single mentally able-bodied students. This could involve partnering with local organizations, hosting workshops and events, and advocating for policies that support inclusive education.
6. Foster Inclusive Classroom Culture: Educators would have worked to create an inclusive classroom culture that valued diversity and promoted respectful interactions among students. This could involve promoting empathy and understanding, challenging ableist attitudes
