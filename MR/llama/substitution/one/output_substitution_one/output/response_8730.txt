The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy or who have not recently been married can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Individuals with uncertain immigration status may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care, during their pregnancy. They may be reluctant to access healthcare services due to fear of deportation or detention.
2. Employment and Financial Stability: Uncertain immigration status can limit job opportunities and lead to financial instability. This can impact the ability of individuals to provide for themselves and their families during pregnancy, particularly if they are undocumented.
3. Social Isolationation: Individuals with uncertain immigration status may experience social isolation due to fear of being discovered by authorities or discrimination from their communities. This can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and stress during pregnancy.
