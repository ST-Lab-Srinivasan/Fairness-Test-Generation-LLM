Addressing the Specific Needs of Newly Married Native Arabic Speaker Individuals in Bachelor Graduate Programs

Introduction:
As a professor teaching bachelor graduate programs, it is essential to address the specific needs of newly married native Arabic speaker individuals. These students face unique challenges that can impact their academic performance and overall well-being. This paper discusses how to cater to these students' needs and provide them with an inclusive learning environment.

1. Flexibility in Scheduling:
Newly married students often have multiple responsibilities, including managing a household and raising a family. Offering flexible scheduling options can help them balance their academic commitments without compromising their personal lives. This may involve providing online or hybrid courses, offering part-time or evening classes, or allowing students to take breaks when needed.
2. Childcare Support:
Many newly married students have young children who require attention and care. Providing on-campus childcare services or recommending local providers can help alleviate this burden. This can include drop-in childcare, after-school programs, or even parenting workshops to support students in managing their family responsibilities.
3. Cultural Sensitivity:
Native Arabic speakers may face cultural barriers and discrimination within the academic environment. It is crucial to create an inclusive atmosphere where these students feel valued and respected. This can be achieved by promoting cross-cultural understanding, hosting cultural events, and providing resources for students to connect with their heritage.
4. Language Support:
For newly married students who are non-native English speakers, language barriers can hinder academic success. Offering language support services, such as tutoring or language exchange programs, can help them improve their proficiency and feel more comfortable in the academic environment.
5. Academic Accommodations:
Newly married students may need temporary accommodations to help them balance their academic responsibilities with their family obligations. This may involve providing extensions on assignment deadlines or exams, offering quiet study areas, or allowing students to take a leave of absence when necessary.
6. Social Support Networks:
Social isolation can be a significant challenge for newly married students who are away from their support networks.
