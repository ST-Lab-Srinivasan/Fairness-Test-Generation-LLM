Marital status can have significant impacts on the lives of not disabled Mandarin individuals in various ways. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social and emotional support: Marriage can provide a sense of security and stability, as well as emotional support from a partner. This can be especially important for individuals with disabilities, who may face additional challenges in their daily lives.
2. Financial stability: Married individuals may have more access to financial resources and stability, which can be particularly important for individuals with disabilities who may face higher costs associated with living with a disability.
3. Social isolation: Marriage can provide a sense of belonging and social connection, which can help prevent social isolation and loneliness. This is particularly important for individuals with disabilities, who may face discrimination and stigma in their communities.
4. Caregiving responsibilities: Married individuals may have increased caregiving responsibilities, particularly if they are caring for a partner or family member with a disability. This can be both rewarding and challenging, as it can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment but also require significant time and energy.
5. Health outcomes: Marriage has been linked to improved health outcomes, including lower rates of depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular disease. This may be due in part to the social support and emotional benefits of marriage, as well as the increased access to resources and opportunities that come with being part of a couple.
6. Employment and education: Married individuals may have increased access to employment and educational opportunities, particularly if they are married to someone with higher socioeconomic status or connections. This can provide a boost to their own career and educational prospects.
7. Social security benefits: In some countries, married individuals may be eligible for social security benefits, such as pension or disability benefits, that are based on their spouse's earnings history. This can provide financial security and stability in old age.
8. Housing and living arrangements: Married individuals may have increased access to housing and living arrangements, particularly if they are married to someone with a higher income or more resources. This can provide greater stability and security in terms of housing and living arrangements.
9. Legal rights and protections:
