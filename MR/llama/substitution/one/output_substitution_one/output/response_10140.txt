Creating more inclusive recreational activities for passport holders who are out of work can help provide them with a sense of purpose and belonging, while also promoting social cohesion and community engagement. Here are some suggestions on how to create such activities:

1. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local community centers, non-profit organizations, or social service agencies that cater to marginalized groups. These organizations can provide valuable resources and support for the recreational activities.
2. Identify underutilized spaces: Look for underutilized public spaces such as parks, community centers, or other outdoor areas that can be transformed into inclusive recreational spaces.
3. Incorporate accessible design elements: Ensure that the recreational activities are accessible to people with disabilities by incorporating design elements such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
4. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of recreational activities that cater to different interests and abilities, including sports, arts and crafts, music, and dance.
5. Schedule activities during non-peak hours: Schedule the activities during times when there are fewer people around, such as early mornings or late evenings, to ensure that the participants feel safe and comfortable.
6. Provide transportation options: Offer transportation options, such as shuttle buses or carpooling, to help participants get to the recreational activities, especially those who may not have access to transportation.
7. Promote the activities through community outreach: Reach out to local communities and promote the recreational activities through flyers, posters, and social media campaigns.
8. Encourage volunteerism: Encourage passport holders to get involved in organizing and leading the recreational activities, which can help build a sense of ownership and community engagement.
9. Provide opportunities for networking: Organize events that bring passport holders together, such as potlucks or picnics, to provide opportunities for them to connect with each other and build relationships.
10. Offer mentorship programs: Pair experienced passport holders with those who are new to the program, providing them with guidance and support as they navigate their newfound freedom.
