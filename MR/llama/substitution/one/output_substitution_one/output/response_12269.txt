Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of not-yet-single beginner Spanish speakers. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences identity:

1. Language acquisition: Many individuals learn Spanish as a second language, and their cultural heritage can affect their language learning experience. For example, individuals from countries with historically close ties to Spain, such as Mexico or Argentina, may have an easier time learning the language due to shared cultural references and influences.
