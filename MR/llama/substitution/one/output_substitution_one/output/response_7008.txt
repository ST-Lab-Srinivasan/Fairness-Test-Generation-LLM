There are several challenges that Mandarin-speaking newly single people may face in the job market, including:

1. Language barrier: For those who are not fluent in English or the local language of their desired workplace, communication can be a significant challenge. This can make it harder to find and apply for jobs, as well as to interview and negotiate salaries.
