3. Facilitate language access: Provide interpretation and translation services during community events or meetings to ensure that they can fully participate and communicate effectively. Offer language classes or resources for those who want to improve their English skills.
4. Encourage representation and leadership opportunities: Identify and promote opportunities for Native American recent immigrants to take on leadership roles within the community, such as serving on boards or committees, leading cultural events, or participating in decision-making processes.
