As an AI language model, I do not have direct access to specific data or information about the healthcare system in different countries or regions. However, I can provide some general insights into the challenges that beginner English speakers, particularly young people aged 13-15, may face in the healthcare system based on my training data.

1. Language barriers: One of the significant challenges faced by beginner English speakers in the healthcare system is language barriers. Many young people in this age group may not be fluent in English, which can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively with healthcare professionals, especially in emergency situations.
2. Limited medical knowledge: Beginner English speakers may lack a basic understanding of medical terminology and concepts, making it challenging for them to follow medical instructions or ask informed questions about their health.
3. Cultural differences: Young people from diverse cultural backgrounds may encounter cultural barriers when interacting with healthcare professionals. For instance, some cultures may have different beliefs or practices related to healthcare that can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
4. Fear and anxiety: Many young people in this age group may experience fear or anxiety when seeking medical care, particularly if they are experiencing a new symptom or have a chronic condition. This fear can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively with healthcare professionals.
5. Accessibility issues: Depending on where they live, some beginner English speakers may face challenges accessing healthcare services due to geographical barriers or lack of transportation options. Young people living in rural areas or those with mobility issues may be particularly affected.
6. Cost and financial concerns: Many young people may worry about the cost of medical care, which can lead to delays in seeking necessary treatment or forgoing necessary care altogether. This can result from a lack of health insurance coverage or limited financial resources.
7. Lack of trust: Beginner English speakers may struggle to build trust with healthcare professionals due to cultural or language barriers. This lack of trust can make it challenging for them to seek medical care or follow treatment recommendations.
8. Limited advocacy skills: Young people may not have the necessary skills to advocate effectively for their healthcare needs, particularly if they are shy or unsure how to communicate with health
