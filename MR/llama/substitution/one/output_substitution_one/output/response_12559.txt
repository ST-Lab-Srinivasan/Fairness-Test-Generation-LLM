Newly single active-duty military personnel may face several challenges when entering the civilian job market after their service. Here are some of the common challenges they might encounter:

1. Adjusting to Civilian Life: Military members have a unique culture and way of life, which can be difficult to transition into civilian life. They may struggle with adapting to the pace of civilian life, social norms, and work expectations.
2. Gap in Work Experience: Military personnel often have gaps in their work experience due to deployments, training, or other military obligations. These gaps can make it difficult for them to compete with civilians who have continuous work experience.
3. Transferable Skills: Military skills are not always transferable to civilian jobs, and military personnel may need to acquire new skills to be competitive in the job market. This can be a challenge, especially for those in specialized fields like engineering or medicine.
4. Networking Challenges: Military personnel often have limited connections in the civilian world, which can make it difficult to find job opportunities. They may need to invest time and effort in building their professional network from scratch.
5. Resume Building: Military personnel may need help translating their military experience into civilian resumes and cover letters. This can be a challenge, especially if they are not familiar with the language and formats used in the civilian job market.
6. Interview Preparation: Military personnel may need to prepare for civilian job interviews differently than they did for military promotions or performance reviews. They may need help understanding the interview process and how to showcase their skills and experiences in a way that appeals to civilian employers.
7. Age Discrimination: Older military personnel may face age discrimination in the job market, as they may be seen as less flexible or less tech-savvy than younger candidates.
8. Disability Accommodations: Military personnel with disabilities may face challenges in finding employers who are willing and able to provide reasonable accommodations in the workplace.
9. Licensing and Certification: Some military personnel may need to obtain civilian licenses or certifications to pursue certain careers, which can be a challenge if they do not have access to the necessary training or resources.
