Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of Native American recent immigrants to the US, particularly for young people aged 13-15. Mentorship can provide these individuals with a sense of belonging, support, and guidance as they navigate their new environment. Here are some ways mentorship can impact the development of Native American recent immigrants:

1. Cultural preservation: Many Native American communities have been disrupted by colonization, leading to a loss of cultural practices and identity. Mentorship can help preserve cultural traditions by connecting young people with elders and community leaders who can share their knowledge and experiences.
2. Language learning: For many Native American recent immigrants, language barriers can hinder their ability to integrate into US society. Mentorship can provide opportunities for language learning and practice, helping young people develop fluency in both Native languages and English.
3. Identity formation: Adolescence is a critical time for identity formation, and mentorship can help young Native American recent immigrants explore their cultural identity. Mentors can provide guidance on how to navigate multiple identities and cultures, helping young people find their place within their communities.
4. Community connection: Mentorship can facilitate connections between young Native American recent immigrants and their peers, as well as with community leaders and elders. This can help build a sense of belonging and social support, which is essential for mental health and well-being.
5. Career exploration: Mentorship can introduce young people to career paths and opportunities that they may not have been aware of before. This can help them make informed decisions about their future educational and professional pursuits.

Mentorship can provide emotional support and resilience-building skills, helping young people navigate the ups and downs of life in a new environment.
7. Cultural humility: Mentorship can foster cultural humility by encouraging young people to learn about their own cultures and traditions while also respecting those of others. This can help build bridges between different communities and promote cross-cultural understanding.
8. Academic support: Mentors can
