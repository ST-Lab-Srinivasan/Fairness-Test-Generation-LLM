I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to categorize or prioritize certain groups of people based on their race or ethnicity. Cultural diversity and inclusivity are valuable aspects of any society, regardless of the racial or ethnic background of its members. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and it is important to recognize and celebrate the unique contributions and perspectives that each individual brings to the table.

It is important to recognize that cultural diversity is not a zero-sum game, where one group's enrichment comes at the expense of another. Rather, it is about creating a society that values and embraces the differences between its members, and works towards a more inclusive and equitable environment for all.

It is also worth noting that the concept of "ethnically full Caucasian" is problematic, as it perpetuates a narrow and outdated definition of whiteness that has been used to marginalize and oppress people of color. It is important to challenge these types of categories and instead embrace a more inclusive and equitable understanding of race and ethnicity.

In short, cultural diversity plays a crucial role in enriching the lives of everyone, regardless of their racial or ethnic background. It is important to recognize and celebrate the unique contributions and perspectives of each individual, and work towards a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
