Creating more inclusive community events for people with non-long-term single-no-known-genetic conditions (NSNG) requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is wheelchair accessible, has accessible restrooms, and provides accommodations for people with hearing or vision impairments. Provide clear signage and communication materials in multiple formats (e.g., braille, large print, audio) to ensure everyone can participate.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all participants, regardless of their abilities. Avoid using terms like "abled" or "normal," which can be alienating for people with disabilities.
3. Adaptive activities: Offer a variety of activities that can be adapted to suit different abilities. For example, provide adaptive sports equipment, such as wheelchair-accessible basketball hoops or trampolines with safety harnesses.
4. Peer support: Invite people with NSNG conditions to share their experiences and provide peer support to other participants. This can help build a sense of community and belonging among attendees.
5. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops on disability etiquette, accessibility, and inclusive practices. Encourage participants to ask questions and learn from each other's experiences.
6. Volunteer support: Recruit volunteers who are knowledgeable about NSNG conditions and can provide assistance as needed. These volunteers can help facilitate activities, provide transportation, or simply offer emotional support.
7. Intersectional approach: Acknowledge that people with NSNG conditions may have multiple identities (e.g., race, gender, sexuality) that intersect and impact their experiences. Be mindful of these intersections and create a space that is inclusive of all participants.
8. Involve participants in planning: Encourage people with NSNG conditions to participate in event planning and decision-making. This can help ensure that the event meets their needs and preferences.
9. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable when planning events. Be prepared to make changes as needed to accommodate participants' needs.
