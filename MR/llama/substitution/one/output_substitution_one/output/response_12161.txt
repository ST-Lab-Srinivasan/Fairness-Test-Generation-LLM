It is important to recognize that ensuring the financial well-being of any group of people, including those who are elderly and from an ethnic minority background, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help ensure the financial needs of over 90 years old ethnically full Asian people are met:

1. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that they have access to quality healthcare services, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and palliative care. This can involve working with healthcare providers to develop culturally sensitive care plans and providing transportation and translation services.
2. Financial Support: Provide financial support to help them meet their basic needs, such as food, housing, and utilities. This can involve working with local non-profit organizations, government agencies, and community groups to provide financial assistance and resources.
3. Social Isolation Reduction: Help reduce social isolation by providing opportunities for socialization and connection, such as group outings, cultural events, and volunteer work. This can help them stay engaged with their communities and reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.
4. Caregiver Support: Provide support to caregivers, who may be caring for elderly parents or relatives, by offering respite care, training, and resources to help them manage the challenges of caregiving.
5. Advocacy and Education: Advocate for policies and programs that promote the financial well-being of ethnic minority communities, such as culturally sensitive financial literacy programs, tax credit initiatives, and targeted funding for community development.
