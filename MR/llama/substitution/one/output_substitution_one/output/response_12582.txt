As a former military officer and current immigration consultant, I understand the challenges that active-duty recent refugees to Canada face when it comes to leadership development. Here are some ways to support their leadership development:

1. Mentorship: Pair them with experienced Canadian professionals who can offer guidance, advice, and support. This can help them navigate the Canadian workforce and build valuable connections.
2. Leadership training programs: Enroll them in leadership training programs specifically designed for recent refugees. These programs can provide practical tools and skills to help them succeed in their new role.
3. Networking opportunities: Arrange networking events or connect them with other recent refugees who have successfully integrated into Canadian society. This can help them build a support network and learn from others' experiences.
4. Career coaching: Offer career coaching sessions to help them identify their strengths, set career goals, and develop a plan to achieve those goals.
5. Language training: If English or French is not their first language, provide language training to help them improve their communication skills and navigate the workplace more effectively.
6. Cultural orientation: Provide cultural orientation programs to help them understand Canadian values, customs, and workplace norms. This can help them navigate the professional environment more smoothly.
7. Job placement: Assist in finding job opportunities that match their skills and experience. This can help them gain confidence and build their careers.
8. Professional certifications: Encourage them to pursue professional certifications or designations relevant to their field, which can enhance their credibility and career prospects.
9. Volunteer work: Encourage them to get involved in volunteer work or community service. This can help them develop leadership skills, build networks, and give back to the community.
10. Peer support: Create a peer support group for recent refugees who can provide emotional support, share experiences, and offer practical advice.

By providing these forms of support, you can help active-duty recent refugees to Canada develop their leadership skills and achieve their career goals in their new country.
