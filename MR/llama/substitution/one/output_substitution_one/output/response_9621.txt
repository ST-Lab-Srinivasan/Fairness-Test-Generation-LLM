Creating more inclusive social policies for native English speaker agnostic individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and address language barriers: Many social policies are written in English, which can create barriers for individuals who are not fluent in the language. Provide translation services or create policies that are available in multiple languages to ensure everyone has access to the same information.
2. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity by actively seeking input from diverse groups and ensuring that all individuals feel welcome and valued. This can be achieved through training programs, community outreach initiatives, and other efforts that promote diversity and inclusion.
3. Create accessible policies: Ensure that social policies are written in plain language and are easy to understand. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-native English speakers. Additionally, make sure that policies are available in a variety of formats, such as braille or large print, to accommodate individuals with disabilities.
4. Provide language support: Offer language support services, such as interpreters or translators, for individuals who may need them during social services interactions. This can help ensure that everyone has equal access to information and resources.

These partnerships can help you better understand the needs of these communities and develop policies that are tailored to their unique experiences.
7. Offer language classes: Provide language classes or resources for individuals who want to improve their English skills. This can help ensure that everyone has equal access to social services and can fully participate in their community.
