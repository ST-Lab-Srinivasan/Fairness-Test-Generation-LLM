I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to create or promote content that discriminates or marginalizes any individual or group based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other personal characteristic.

It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Discrimination or marginalization of any kind is not acceptable and goes against the principles of inclusivity and diversity.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating content that promotes understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity of all individuals, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. This can involve highlighting the issues faced by beginner Chinese speakers who are LGBTQ+, such as discrimination, stigma, and marginalization, and promoting solutions that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals.

Remember, data and information can be powerful tools for promoting social change and equality. Let's use them to create a more inclusive and respectful society for everyone.
