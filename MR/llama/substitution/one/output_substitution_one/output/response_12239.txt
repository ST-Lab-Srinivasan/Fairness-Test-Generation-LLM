There are several ways to support the economic empowerment of Native American recent refugees in the United States:

1. Provide access to financial education and literacy programs: Many Native American communities have limited access to financial resources and services, making it difficult for them to manage their finances effectively. Providing financial education and literacy programs can help them better understand how to budget, save, and invest their money.
