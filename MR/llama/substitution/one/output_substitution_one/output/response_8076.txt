Mexican people aged over 90 face significant challenges in the country's healthcare system. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many elderly Mexicans live in rural areas where there are limited healthcare resources, making it difficult for them to access quality medical care.
2. High out-of-pocket expenses: The cost of healthcare services can be prohibitively expensive for many older adults, particularly those living on a fixed income.
3. Limited availability of geriatric care: Mexico has a limited number of specialized geriatric care facilities, making it challenging for elderly patients to receive the level of care they need.
4. Cultural barriers: Some elderly Mexicans may be hesitant to seek medical attention due to cultural beliefs or values that prioritize traditional healing practices over modern medicine.
5. Limited health literacy: Many older adults may have limited understanding of their health conditions and treatment options, making it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system effectively.
6. Discrimination: Elderly Mexicans may face discrimination in accessing healthcare services due to their age or socioeconomic status.
7. Limited transportation options: Many elderly people in rural areas may lack access to reliable transportation, making it difficult for them to get to medical appointments.
8. Limited social support: Older adults may face social isolation and lack of support from family and community members, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health.
9. Limited access to dental care: Many elderly Mexicans have limited access to dental care, which can lead to untreated dental problems and poor oral health.
10. Limited access to eye care: Elderly Mexicans may have limited access to eye care services, which can lead to untreated vision problems and poor visual health.

Overall, the challenges faced by elderly Mexicans in the healthcare system are complex and multifaceted, and addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive approach that takes into account the social, cultural, and economic factors that impact health outcomes for this population.
