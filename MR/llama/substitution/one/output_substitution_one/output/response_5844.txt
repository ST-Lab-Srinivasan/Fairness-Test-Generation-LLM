To ensure that the educational needs of native Spanish speaker students who are English language learners (ELLs) are met, here are some strategies and best practices that teachers can implement:

1. Provide a supportive learning environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive classroom environment where ELLs feel comfortable and supported. Use visual aids, gestures, and other communication methods to help them understand the lesson.
2. Differentiate instruction: Take into account the individual needs of each ELL student. Provide different levels of complexity and support depending on their proficiency level.
3. Use authentic materials: Use real-life materials like videos, songs, and news articles to teach language and content. This will help students connect what they are learning in class with their everyday lives.
4. Encourage peer-to-peer interaction: Pair ELLs with native English speakers for collaborative activities and discussions. This can help them practice their language skills and build confidence in speaking.
5. Provide opportunities for output: Give students regular opportunities to use the target language through speaking, writing, and other forms of communication.
6. Use formative assessments: Regularly assess student progress throughout the lesson or unit. Adjust instruction accordingly based on the data collected.
7. Involve families: Encourage parents to participate in their child's education by providing opportunities for them to learn about and support their child's language development.
8. Provide scaffolding: Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This can help ELLs build on their existing knowledge and skills.
9. Use technology: Utilize digital tools and resources to provide additional support and practice opportunities for ELLs, such as online language learning platforms, audio and visual aids, and multimedia resources.
10. Offer additional support: Provide extra help or accommodations for ELLs who need them, such as one-on-one tutoring or modified assignments.
11. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that learning a new language can be challenging, and be prepared to adapt your teaching methods based on the needs of your students.
12. Encourage self-directed learning: Encourage ELLs to take ownership of their language learning by
