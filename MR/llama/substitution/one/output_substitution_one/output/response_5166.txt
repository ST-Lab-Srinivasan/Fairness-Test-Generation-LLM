Addressing the Needs of Non-Citizen Individuals in Early Pregnancy during Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Non-citizen individuals, including undocumented immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees, often face unique challenges during disaster responses. These individuals may be overlooked or neglected in disaster response efforts due to their legal status or lack of access to resources. This paper will focus on the needs of non-citizen individuals in early pregnancy during disaster responses and propose strategies for addressing these needs.

Needs Assessment:
Non-citizen individuals in early pregnancy may face several challenges during disaster responses, including:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Non-citizen individuals may have limited access to healthcare services due to their legal status or lack of health insurance. This can lead to delays in receiving adequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.

4. Language barriers: Non-citizen individuals may face language barriers, which can hinder their ability to communicate with emergency responders or access vital information during disasters.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Non-citizen individuals may face discrimination and stigma during disaster responses, which can further exacerbate their vulnerability.

Strategies for Addressing Needs:

1. Developing cultural competence training for emergency responders: Emergency responders should receive cultural competence training to understand the needs and vulnerabilities of non-citizen individuals. This training can help responders provide more effective and sensitive support during disaster responses.
2. Providing access to healthcare services: Non-citizen individuals should have
