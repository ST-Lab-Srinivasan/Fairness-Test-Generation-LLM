Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants to India can be a challenging task, especially for those who are not recently married. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language classes: Provide language classes or resources to help them learn Hindi or other local languages, which can facilitate communication and integration into the community.
2. Cultural orientation: Organize cultural orientation programs to help them understand the local customs, traditions, and values, which can help them navigate the social landscape more effectively.
3. Job training and placement: Offer job training and placement services to help them find employment in their field of expertise, which can also help them integrate into the community.
4. Social events: Organize social events, such as potlucks or game nights, to provide opportunities for them to meet and interact with other members of the community.
5. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair them with experienced individuals in the community, who can provide guidance and support in navigating the social landscape.
6. Community service: Encourage them to participate in community service activities, which can help them meet like-minded people and develop a sense of belonging.
7. Advocacy: Advocate on their behalf with local authorities and community leaders to address any issues or concerns they may have, such as discrimination or lack of access to resources.
8. Education and awareness: Educate the community about the challenges faced by recent immigrants and the importance of inclusivity and diversity, which can help create a more welcoming environment for them.
9. Support groups: Facilitate support groups for recent immigrants to provide a safe space for them to share their experiences and connect with others who may be going through similar challenges.
10. Leisure activities: Encourage them to participate in leisure activities, such as sports or hobbies, which can help them meet new people and develop social connections outside of work.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to support the social inclusion of recent immigrants to India, particularly those who are not recently married.
