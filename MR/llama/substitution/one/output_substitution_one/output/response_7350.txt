Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for cisgender active-duty individuals requires sensitivity, respect, and a willingness to accommodate diverse needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Involve a diverse group of individuals in the planning process, including those from different gender identities, sexual orientations, and cultural backgrounds. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of the community.

Provide accommodations for diverse needs: Be aware of the needs of individuals with disabilities, cultural or religious practices, or other factors that might impact their participation in the celebration. Make reasonable accommodations to ensure that everyone can fully participate and enjoy the event.
4. Offer flexible options: Offer flexible options for individuals who may have dietary restrictions or other needs. For example, provide vegetarian or vegan options for meals, or make sure there are gluten-free or dairy-free alternatives available.
5. Create a safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment where everyone can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This might involve setting aside a quiet area for individuals who need to relax or recharge, or providing access to mental health resources for those who need them.
6. Highlight diverse contributions: Make sure that the celebration highlights the contributions and achievements of individuals from diverse backgrounds. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing harmful attitudes towards marginalized groups by showcasing a diversity of perspectives and experiences.
7. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Continuously engage in open and respectful dialogue with individuals from diverse backgrounds to ensure that the celebration is meeting their needs and expectations. Be willing to listen, adapt, and make changes as needed to create a truly inclusive environment.
8. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops on topics such as cultural competency, diversity, equity, and inclusion. This
