The impact of military status on the lives of non-democratic, non-wealthy, and multimillionaire individuals can vary greatly depending on the specific context and society in question. However, some common themes that have been observed across different cultures and time periods include:

1. Lack of political power and representation: Non-democratic societies often marginalize or exclude certain groups, including those who are not wealthy or do not hold military status. This can result in a lack of political power and representation for these individuals, making it difficult for them to advocate for their rights or interests.
2. Economic inequality: In many societies, the military is seen as a symbol of wealth and prestige, and those who are part of the military may be more likely to have better economic opportunities and higher social status. This can exacerbate existing economic inequalities, making it harder for non-democratic individuals to access resources and opportunities.
3. Social stigma: Non-democratic societies often place a high value on military service, and those who are not part of the military may be seen as less deserving or less loyal to their country. This can lead to social stigma and discrimination against non-military individuals, making it difficult for them to fit in or advance in society.
4. Limited access to education and training: In some societies, access to education and training opportunities may be restricted to those who are part of the military or have a military background. This can limit the opportunities available to non-military individuals, making it harder for them to acquire new skills or advance in their careers.
5. Difficulty accessing healthcare: In some societies, access to healthcare may be restricted to those who are part of the military or have a military background. This can make it difficult for non-military individuals to access medical care, especially in emergency situations.
6. Limited freedom of expression: Non-democratic societies often have strict limits on freedom of expression, and those who are not part of the military may be more likely to face reprisals or punishment for expressing dissenting opinions. This can make it difficult for non-military individuals to speak out against injustices or advocate for their rights.
