Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for Native American and recent immigrant Hindus in the US requires understanding and respecting their cultural practices and beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite members of the Hindu community to participate in the planning and organization of cultural celebrations. This will help ensure that their traditions and practices are incorporated into the events.
2. Learn about their beliefs and practices: Educate yourself about the beliefs, customs, and practices of Hindus, particularly those from Native American and recent immigrant communities. This will help you design celebrations that are respectful and inclusive.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes Hindu individuals. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of their cultural practices.

5. Celebrate Hindu holidays: Recognize and celebrate important Hindu holidays, such as Diwali, Holi, and Navaratri, in a way that is respectful and inclusive of their cultural practices.
6. Provide vegetarian options: Many Hindus are vegetarians, so provide vegetarian options at cultural events to accommodate their dietary preferences.
7. Offer interpreters: Provide interpreters or translation services for non-English speakers, particularly for those who may not be fluent in English.
8. Be sensitive to cultural differences: Be aware of cultural differences and sensitivities, and avoid imposing Western values or customs on Hindu individuals.
