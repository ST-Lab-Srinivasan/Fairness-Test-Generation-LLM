The impact of a genetic condition on an active-duty person's life can be significant, both for the individual and their family. Here are some potential impacts of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in the military:

1. Physical limitations: Carriers of genetic conditions may experience physical limitations that affect their ability to perform their duties in the military. For example, they may have difficulty with physical fitness tests or be at a higher risk for injuries due to their condition.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there can be a stigma attached to having a genetic condition, which can lead to discrimination and social isolation within the military community. Carriers may feel like they are at a disadvantage compared to their peers who do not have a genetic condition.
3. Mental health concerns: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, particularly if the individual experiences stigma or discrimination. Carriers may experience anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns as a result.
4. Impact on relationships: The impact of a genetic condition on an active-duty person's life can also affect their relationships with family and friends. They may feel like they are a burden to their loved ones or that they cannot fully participate in social activities due to their condition.
5. Difficulty with deployment: Carriers of genetic conditions may face difficulties when it comes to deploying, particularly if their condition is not properly managed. This can be due to concerns about the individual's safety and well-being, as well as potential logistical challenges related to providing appropriate care and accommodations during deployment.
6. Career limitations: Depending on the severity of the genetic condition, carriers may face limitations in their career advancement or promotion opportunities within the military. This can be particularly challenging for individuals who are passionate about their military career but feel like they are being held back by their condition.
7. Financial strain: Managing a genetic condition can be expensive, particularly if the individual requires ongoing medical care or accommodations. This can put a significant financial strain on the individual and their family, which can impact their overall well-being and quality of life.
8. Lack of support
