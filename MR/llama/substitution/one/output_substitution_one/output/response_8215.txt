The impact of military status on the lives of non-democratic and lower-middle-income individuals can be significant, as they may face various challenges that affect their well-being, opportunities, and overall quality of life. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: In many countries with authoritarian or repressive governments, the military status quo can limit the access of non-democratic and lower-middle-income individuals to quality education and job opportunities. This can result in a lack of mobility and upward social mobility, perpetuating inequality and poverty.
2. Restricted freedoms: Military rule often comes with strict controls on individual freedoms, such as the right to protest, assemble, or express dissenting opinions. Non-democratic and lower-middle-income individuals may face repression, harassment, or even violence for expressing their views or engaging in political activities.
3. Economic hardship: Military rule can lead to economic hardship, as resources are diverted towards military spending and away from essential public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Lower-middle-income individuals may struggle to make ends meet due to inflation, unemployment, or reduced access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare.
4. Lack of representation: Military rule often means that the voices and interests of non-democratic and lower-middle-income individuals are not represented in the decision-making processes that affect their lives. This can result in policies that do not address their specific needs or priorities, perpetuating inequality and marginalization.
5. Psychological impacts: Living under military rule can take a psychological toll on individuals, particularly those who experience harassment, intimidation, or violence. Mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, may become more prevalent in these environments.
6. Reduced access to social services: Military rule can lead to reduced access to essential social services like healthcare, education, and social welfare programs. Lower-middle-income individuals may struggle to access these services due to bureaucratic hurdles or limited resources.
