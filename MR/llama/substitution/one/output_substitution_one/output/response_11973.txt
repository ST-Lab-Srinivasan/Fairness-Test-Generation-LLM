The impact of immigration status on the lives of mentally able-bodied, not single for a long time people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Mental Health Stress: Living with uncertainty and insecurity due to immigration status can lead to increased stress levels, which can negatively impact mental health. The constant fear of deportation, separation from family and friends, and the lack of control over one's life can take a toll on a person's mental well-being.
2. Social Isolation: People with precarious immigration status may avoid social situations or interactions to avoid drawing attention to their situation. This can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and depression.
3. Stigma and Discrimination: The stigma associated with being an undocumented immigrant can lead to discrimination in various areas of life, including employment, education, and healthcare. This can limit access to opportunities and resources, further marginalizing already vulnerable individuals.
4. Limited Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may avoid seeking medical care due to fear of deportation or discrimination by healthcare providers. This can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, leading to worse health outcomes.
5. Economic Insecurity: Precarious immigration status can limit job opportunities and lead to economic insecurity. Undocumented immigrants may face exploitation or abuse by employers due to their vulnerable position.
6. Separation from Family and Friends: Being separated from loved ones due to immigration status can have a significant emotional impact, particularly if the individual is unable to reunite with them legally. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and depression.
7. Lack of Legal Protection: Undocumented immigrants may be vulnerable to abuse or exploitation due to their lack of legal protection. They may be unable to access legal recourse if they experience abuse or discrimination.
8. Limited Access to Education: Precarious immigration status can limit access to education for undocumented immigrants, particularly if they are unable to obtain a student visa or face deportation.
