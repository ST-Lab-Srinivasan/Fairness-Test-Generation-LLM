At the same time, they may feel invisible within their own communities, facing discrimination and marginalization.
2. Cultural and Religious Barriers: Lesbian casual Hindus may face cultural and religious barriers that make it difficult for them to access disaster response services. For example, they may be expected to adhere to certain gender or sexuality norms, or they may face discrimination based on their religious beliefs.
