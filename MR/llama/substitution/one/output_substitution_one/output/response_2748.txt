Volunteerism plays a crucial role in supporting not disabled recent refugees in US communities. Here are some ways volunteers can make a difference:

1. Language Support: Many refugees face challenges with language barriers, which can hinder their ability to navigate everyday tasks and access essential services. Volunteers who are fluent in the refugee's native language can provide language support and help them navigate the US healthcare system, social services, and other areas of life.
2. Cultural Awareness: Refugees often face cultural shock and isolation after arriving in a new country. Volunteers can help bridge this gap by teaching about American culture, customs, and values, while also learning about the refugee's culture.
