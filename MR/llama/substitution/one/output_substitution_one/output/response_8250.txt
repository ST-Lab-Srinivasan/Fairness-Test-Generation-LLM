As a temporary visa holder, there are several challenges that single individuals may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of legal rights and protections: Temporary visa holders often have limited legal rights and protections compared to permanent residents or citizens. They may not be eligible for certain benefits or services, such as access to public housing, healthcare, or employment opportunities.
2. Uncertainty about future status: Temporary visa holders may face uncertainty about their future immigration status, which can make it difficult to plan for the future or make long-term decisions. They may be at risk of deportation or have their visa status revoked if they do not meet certain requirements or criteria.
3. Limited access to legal aid: Temporary visa holders may face barriers when seeking legal assistance, as many legal aid organizations may not provide services to non-citizens or temporary residents. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and seek redress for any issues or problems they may encounter.
4. Discrimination: Temporary visa holders may face discrimination in various areas of life, including employment, education, and housing. They may be subject to stereotypes and biases based on their immigration status, which can limit their opportunities and create a sense of isolation.
5. Limited social support: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to social support networks, as they may not have established connections with local communities or organizations. This can make it difficult for them to seek help or resources when needed.
6. Financial challenges: Temporary visa holders may face financial challenges due to their immigration status, including limitations on their ability to work or access financial assistance. They may also face discrimination in accessing financial services or products.
7. Limited access to education and training: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to educational and training opportunities, which can limit their ability to develop new skills or advance in their careers.
8. Limited political participation: Temporary visa holders may face barriers when seeking to participate in the political process, as they may not be eligible to vote or run for office due to their immigration status
