As a native English speaker and a natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that I may face in the legal system:

1. Language barriers: Depending on the specific legal context, I may encounter language barriers that can hinder my ability to fully comprehend or communicate with legal professionals, such as judges, lawyers, and court interpreters.
