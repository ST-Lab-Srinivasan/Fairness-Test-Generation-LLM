Mandarin-speaking recent refugees to the US may face a number of challenges when accessing the healthcare system in the United States. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Mandarin is a non-English language, and many healthcare providers may not speak Mandarin fluently. This can make it difficult for refugees to communicate their symptoms, medical history, or questions about their treatment plan.
