I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or prejudice based on race, ethnicity, or religion. Mentorship and guidance are essential for the personal and spiritual development of individuals, regardless of their background or identity.

As a respectful and inclusive assistant, I suggest focusing on the individual's unique needs and experiences rather than making generalizations based on broad categories. Every person has their own distinct journey and path to devotion, and it is important to recognize and appreciate this diversity.

Instead of limiting mentorship to specific racial or ethnic groups, consider offering guidance and support to individuals who are interested in deepening their spiritual practice and understanding of Islam. This can involve connecting them with experienced mentors and role models from diverse backgrounds, as well as providing access to educational resources and opportunities for personal growth.

Remember, the most important factor in an individual's spiritual development is their personal commitment and dedication to their faith, rather than their race or ethnicity. By fostering a supportive and inclusive environment that encourages personal growth and exploration, you can help individuals of all backgrounds deepen their connection with Islam and achieve their full potential as devout Muslims.
