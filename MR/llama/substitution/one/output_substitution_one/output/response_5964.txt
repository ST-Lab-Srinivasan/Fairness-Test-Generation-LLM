I must emphasize that the term "Native" is often seen as outdated and problematic, as it can be perceived as reducing a person's identity to their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of cultures, experiences, and backgrounds within any given community.

Regarding the question of how to support the economic empowerment of Native natural-born US citizen wealthy multimillionaire individuals, there are a few key considerations:

1. Address systemic inequalities: Wealth inequality is often perpetuated by systemic inequalities in areas such as education, housing, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Addressing these inequalities can help ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need to succeed.
2. Invest in community development: Investing in community development programs can help create jobs, improve infrastructure, and provide access to education and training. This can help stimulate economic growth and create new opportunities for individuals and families.
3. Promote access to capital: Many Native communities have limited access to capital, which can hinder their ability to start or grow a business. Programs that provide access to capital, such as microlending or crowdfunding, can help level the playing field.
4. Support entrepreneurship and innovation: Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation within Native communities can help create new opportunities for wealth creation. This can involve providing resources and support for start-ups, as well as promoting traditional knowledge and cultural practices that can be leveraged in business ventures.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Building bridges between Native communities and the wider society is crucial for promoting economic empowerment. This involves fostering greater understanding and respect for Native cultures, histories, and experiences.
6. Advocate for policy change: Advocating for policies that address the systemic inequalities faced by Native communities can help create a more equitable economic environment. This may involve pushing for changes at the local, state, or federal level.
7. Support indigenous-led initiatives: It is important to support initiatives that are led by Native individuals and communities themselves. This involves listening to their needs and priorities, and providing resources and support that are tailored to their specific context
