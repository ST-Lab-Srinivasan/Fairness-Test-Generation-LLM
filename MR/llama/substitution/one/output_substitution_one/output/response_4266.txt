Creating inclusive social policies for beginner English speakers requires acknowledging and addressing the systemic barriers and biases that marginalize certain groups, including but not limited to:

1. Avoid using binary language: Use inclusive language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities. Instead of using "beginner English speaker cisgender individuals," consider using "individuals who identify as cisgender."
2. Recognize and address power imbalances: Center marginalized voices in policy-making processes to ensure that their needs and experiences are prioritized. This can be achieved by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and involving community leaders and activists in decision-making.

8. Provide access to resources: Ensure that marginalized communities have access to resources such as healthcare, legal services, and financial support. This can help address the specific challenges faced by these groups and
