To create more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-millionaire individuals, it's important to address the root causes of economic inequality. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Progressive taxation: Implement a progressive tax system where the wealthy are taxed at a higher rate than the poor and middle class. This can help reduce income inequality and generate revenue for social programs that benefit everyone, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
2. Minimum wage laws: Increase the minimum wage to a living wage that allows workers to afford basic necessities without relying on government assistance. This can help lift people out of poverty and reduce the reliance on low-wage jobs.
3. Social safety nets: Strengthen social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance, food assistance programs, and housing subsidies, to provide a financial cushion for those who are struggling.
4. Access to education and training: Invest in free or affordable education and job training programs that can help individuals acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market and access better-paying jobs.
5. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers, such as discrimination and lack of access to resources and opportunities, that may prevent marginalized groups from achieving economic stability.
6. Community development: Invest in community development programs that promote local economic growth and provide job opportunities, training, and support for individuals and small businesses.
7. Financial inclusion: Promote financial inclusion by providing access to affordable banking services, credit, and loans for individuals who are underserved or excluded from the traditional financial system.
8. Support for small businesses: Provide support for small businesses, such as microloans, mentorship programs, and training, to help them grow and create jobs in local communities.
9. Housing affordability: Implement policies that address housing affordability, such as rent control, subsidized housing, and homeownership programs, to help individuals and families access safe and affordable housing.
10. Public services: Invest in public services, such as healthcare, transportation, and recreational facilities, that benefit everyone and promote a higher quality of life.
