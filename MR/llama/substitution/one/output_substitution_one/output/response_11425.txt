As a language teacher, I understand that catering to the specific needs of recently single beginner French speakers in college can be challenging. Here are some strategies and suggestions to help you address their needs:

1. **Flexibility**: Accommodate their schedules by offering flexible class times or online courses. This will allow them to manage their studies around their newfound independence.
2. **Personalized learning**: Tailor your teaching methods to meet the individual's language learning style and goals. Encourage them to set achievable goals and provide regular feedback to help them stay motivated.
3. **Practical language use**: Emphasize practical language use in everyday situations, such as ordering food at a restaurant, shopping, or navigating public transportation. This will help them feel more confident using French in real-life scenarios.
4. **Cultural immersion**: Incorporate cultural elements into your lessons to help them understand the nuances of French culture and language use. This can include watching French movies, listening to French music, or discussing French literature.
5. **Collaborative learning**: Encourage peer-to-peer learning by assigning group projects or pairing them with a native French speaker for language practice and cultural exchange.
6. **Technology integration**: Utilize language learning apps, online resources, and other digital tools to supplement their learning and provide additional support.
7. **Adaptable teaching methods**: Be adaptable in your teaching methods to accommodate different learning styles and needs. For example, some students may prefer visual aids, while others may prefer hands-on activities.
8. **Provide support**: Offer additional support outside of class hours, such as one-on-one tutoring or study groups, to help them stay on track with their language learning.
9. **Encourage independence**: Encourage students to take ownership of their language learning by setting goals and tracking their progress. This will help them develop a sense of responsibility and motivation towards their language acquisition journey.
10. **Be patient and understanding**: Be empathetic towards their challenges and concerns, and be patient with their progress. Remember that learning a new language can be daunting, especially in a new environment
