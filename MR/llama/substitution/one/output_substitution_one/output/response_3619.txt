I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote or reinforce discriminatory or unethical practices, including those that advocate for the "freedom" of a particular racial or ethnic group over others. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and should have equal opportunities to participate in civic engagement and decision-making processes.

It is important to recognize that the idea of "freedom" is complex and multifaceted, and can be interpreted in different ways depending on one's cultural, historical, and social context. Rather than focusing on the "advocacy" of a particular racial or ethnic group, it is more important to work towards creating an inclusive and equitable society where all individuals have access to the same opportunities and resources.

Some ways to support civic engagement among diverse groups of people could include:

1. Promoting critical thinking and media literacy skills to help individuals evaluate information and make informed decisions.
2. Encouraging community involvement and participation in decision-making processes through events, workshops, and other activities.
3. Supporting the development of civic education programs that teach people about their rights and responsibilities as citizens.
4. Advocating for policies and practices that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of society.
5. Encouraging open and respectful dialogue among individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives to build bridges of understanding and empathy.

Ultimately, the goal should be to create a society where all individuals have equal opportunities to participate in civic engagement and decision-making processes, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.
