Unmarried traditionalists, who place a high value on traditional gender roles and family structures, may face unique challenges during disaster responses. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Inclusive communication: Ensure that communication channels are inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of gender or family status. Provide information in multiple languages and formats, such as visual aids or audio messages, to reach a diverse audience.
2. Gender-separate shelters: Provide separate shelters for men and women, with adequate privacy and security, to accommodate the cultural and religious preferences of unmarried traditionalists.
3. Family-friendly facilities: Offer family-friendly facilities such as cr√®ches or childcare services, to enable unmarried traditionalists to focus on their relief efforts without worrying about their dependents.
4. Traditional gender roles: Recognize and respect the traditional gender roles of unmarried traditionalists during disaster responses. For example, allow men to take on more leadership roles, while women are responsible for childcare and domestic duties.
5. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the needs of unmarried traditionalists during disaster responses. This can help build trust and encourage them to participate in relief efforts.
6. Cultural sensitivity: Be culturally sensitive when providing aid to unmarried traditionalists. For example, provide separate food and shelter for men and women, and ensure that gender-segregated spaces are provided.
7. Support networks: Establish support networks of other unmarried traditionalists who can provide emotional and practical support during disaster responses. This can help alleviate feelings of isolation and loneliness.
8. Religious accommodations: Provide religious accommodations, such as prayer spaces or halal food options, to cater to the spiritual needs of unmarried traditionalists.
9. Inclusive decision-making: Ensure that unmarried traditionalists are included in decision-making processes and have a voice in shaping relief efforts. This can help build trust and ensure that their needs are addressed.
10. Capacity building: Provide capacity-building training for unmarried traditionalists, such as first aid or emergency response training
