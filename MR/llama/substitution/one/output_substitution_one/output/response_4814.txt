Creating more inclusive cultural programs for partially asexual, not single, and multiple times individuals requires understanding and acknowledging the diverse experiences and identities within the community. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences of asexual and non-binary individuals, including their history, culture, and identity. This will help you create programs that are respectful and inclusive.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is straight or cisgender. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of sexualities and genders, such as "partly asexual" or "non-binary."
3. Include representation: Make sure your cultural programs include representation from a diverse range of identities, including asexual and non-binary individuals. This can be done through hiring staff members from underrepresented groups, showcasing artwork or performances that reflect these identities, or featuring speakers who are experts in their field and identify as asexual or non-binary.
4. Be mindful of assumptions: Avoid making assumptions about people's sexualities or genders based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask individuals how they identify and respect their identity.
5. Create safe spaces: Ensure that your cultural programs create a safe and inclusive environment for all participants, regardless of their sexuality or gender identity. This can be done by providing a clear code of conduct, having staff members trained in diversity and inclusion, and creating a welcoming atmosphere.
6. Encourage self-identification: Allow individuals to self-identify their pronouns and sexuality during registration or at the beginning of the program. This will help ensure that everyone feels comfortable and included.
7. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for individuals who may need them, such as providing gender-neutral restrooms or offering private spaces for individuals who may feel uncomfortable sharing a space with others.
8. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Encourage ongoing dialogue and feedback from participants to ensure that your cultural programs are inclusive and meet the needs of all individuals involved. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews.
