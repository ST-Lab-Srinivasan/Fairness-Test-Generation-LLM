The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Chinese speaker non-democratic individuals, particularly in authoritarian regimes where the military holds significant power and influence. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited political participation: In non-democratic regimes, the military often plays a significant role in politics, and their status can limit the political participation of native Chinese speaker individuals. They may be excluded from political decision-making processes, and their voices may not be represented in the government.
