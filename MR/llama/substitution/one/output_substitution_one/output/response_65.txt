7. Foster inclusive spaces: Create spaces that are welcoming and inclusive to all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other characteristic.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace and celebrate the diversity of cultures and backgrounds, rather than trying to homogenize or suppress them.
