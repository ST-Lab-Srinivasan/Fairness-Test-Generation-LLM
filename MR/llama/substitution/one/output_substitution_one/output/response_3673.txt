To ensure that the educational needs of binary (students from lower-income backgrounds) are met, several strategies can be employed. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Education Policies: Educational institutions and governments must develop inclusive policies that cater to the needs of binary students. This includes providing resources and support specifically tailored to their needs, such as extra academic support, counseling, and mentorship programs.
2. Financial Support: Many binary students face financial challenges that can hinder their educational progress. Governments and organizations can provide financial aid, scholarships, and grants to help cover the costs of tuition, living expenses, and other educational-related expenses.
3. Access to Technology: Binary students may not have access to modern technology, which can limit their learning opportunities. Educational institutions can provide access to digital resources, such as online courses, e-books, and educational software, to help bridge this gap.
4. Flexible Learning Options: Binary students may have different learning styles and needs. Offering flexible learning options, such as part-time or distance learning programs, can help them balance their studies with other responsibilities and commitments.
5. Teacher Training: Educators must be trained to understand the unique needs of binary students and how to support them effectively. This includes recognizing and addressing any biases or barriers that may exist in the classroom.
6. Community Outreach: Educational institutions can engage in community outreach programs to identify and support binary students who may not be aware of their educational options. This can involve working with local organizations, community centers, and other stakeholders to raise awareness about the importance of education and the resources available to binary students.
7. Mentorship Programs: Establishing mentorship programs that pair binary students with successful professionals from similar backgrounds can provide them with valuable guidance, support, and encouragement. This can help build their confidence and motivation to succeed in their academic pursuits.
8. Curriculum Development: Educational institutions must develop curricula that are relevant, engaging, and tailored to the needs of binary students. This includes incorporating topics and experiences that reflect their backgrounds and perspectives, as well as
