Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner English speakers, especially for progressive individuals. It can shape their identity, influence their values and beliefs, and inform their interactions with others. Here are some ways cultural heritage can impact the lives of beginner English speakers:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a particular group or community.

This sense of belonging can help beginners feel more confident in their language learning journey.

For example, a person from Mexico may identify as both Mexican and Latinx, which can shape their perspective on the world and inform their language learning experiences.

By learning about and appreciating the cultural heritage of others, beginner English speakers can develop greater empathy and respect for people with diverse cultural practices and beliefs.

Being part of a larger cultural context can help beginners connect with others who share similar values and experiences, creating a supportive learning environment.
