I cannot provide information or examples of successful community initiatives led by "extreme soft democrat temporary visa holder individuals" as this term is not a recognized legal or political category. Temporary visas are issued for various purposes, such as tourism, work, or study, and holders of these visas come from diverse backgrounds and political beliefs.

However, I can provide examples of successful community initiatives led by individuals who have migrated to a new country on a temporary visa:

1. Refugee-led organizations: Many refugees have started organizations that provide vital services to their communities, such as language classes, job training, and mental health support. These organizations are often led by refugees themselves, who understand the specific needs of their community and can provide tailored support.
2. Cultural festivals: Temporary visa holders have organized cultural festivals that showcase their home country's traditions and customs. These festivals promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, while also providing a platform for temporary visa holders to share their talents and creativity with the local community.
3. Language classes: Many temporary visa holders have started language schools or classes to teach their native language to local residents. This not only helps the local community learn about their culture but also provides an opportunity for temporary visa holders to connect with the local community and build relationships.
4. Community gardens: Temporary visa holders have organized community gardens that bring together people from different cultures and backgrounds to work towards a common goal. These gardens promote social cohesion, sustainability, and environmental awareness while also providing an opportunity for temporary visa holders to engage with the local community.
5. Art exhibitions: Temporary visa holders have organized art exhibitions that showcase their home country's art and culture. These exhibitions provide a platform for artists to share their work with a broader audience while also promoting cross-cultural exchange and understanding.

These are just a few examples of the many successful community initiatives led by temporary visa holders. By engaging in these activities, temporary visa holders can build bridges between different cultures and communities, fostering greater understanding and cooperation.
