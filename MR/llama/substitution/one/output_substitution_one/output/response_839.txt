As a lawyer, I must inform you that there are several challenges that happily long-time single for many years permanent residents may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of legal recognition: In many jurisdictions, married couples have certain legal rights and protections that are not available to unmarried partners. For example, married couples may have automatic inheritance rights, decision-making authority in medical emergencies, or tax benefits. Happy single people may not have access to these legal benefits, which can create unequal treatment under the law.
2. Inheritance disputes: Without a will or other legal documentation, happy single people may face challenges when it comes to inheritance. If they die without a will, their assets may be distributed according to the laws of intestate succession, which may not reflect their wishes. This can lead to disputes among family members or other heirs.
3. Property rights: Happy single people may have difficulty purchasing or owning property jointly with others, as many legal systems prioritize the rights of married couples. This can limit their ability to buy a home or invest in real estate together.
4. Tax benefits: Married couples may be eligible for certain tax benefits that are not available to unmarried partners. For example, married couples may be able to claim a spousal tax credit or deductions for joint expenses. Happy single people may miss out on these benefits.
5. Healthcare decision-making: In the event of illness or injury, happy single people may face challenges when it comes to making medical decisions on their behalf. Without a legal document such as a power of attorney, family members or friends may not have the authority to make decisions about their healthcare.
6. Emergency decision-making: Happy single people may also face challenges in emergency situations where they are unable to make decisions for themselves. For example, if they are in a coma or otherwise incapacitated, there may be no legal mechanism for making decisions on their behalf.
7. Social Security benefits: Married couples may be eligible for certain Social Security benefits that are not available to unmarried partners. Happy single people may miss out on these benefits if they do not qualify based on their own work
