As a sexuality researcher, I must emphasize that asexuality is a valid and legitimate sexual orientation, just like any other. However, societal attitudes towards asexuality can lead to marginalization and stigma, which can impact the well-being of asexual individuals. Here are some ways data can be used to highlight the issues faced by partly asexual not lifelong married individuals:

1. Prevalence estimates: Collect data on the prevalence of asexuality in different populations to estimate the number of people who identify as asexual. This can help raise awareness and challenge stereotypes that asexuality is rare or abnormal.
2. Survey research: Conduct surveys to gather data on the experiences and challenges faced by asexual individuals in different areas of life, such as relationships, employment, and mental health. This can help identify specific issues that asexual individuals face and inform strategies for addressing them.
3. Case studies: Collect in-depth case studies of asexual individuals to explore their experiences and perspectives on various aspects of life, such as their sexual identity, relationships, and social interactions. This can help provide rich, nuanced insights into the lives of asexual individuals.
4. Data visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present findings in an engaging and easily digestible format. For example, create infographics or interactive visualizations to highlight trends and patterns in the data.
5. Policy analysis: Analyze policies and laws that impact asexual individuals, such as those related to marriage, healthcare, and employment. This can help identify areas where policy changes could benefit asexual individuals and inform advocacy efforts.
6. Community-based research: Collaborate with asexual communities and organizations to design and conduct research that is responsive to their needs and priorities. This can help ensure that the research is relevant, useful, and empowering for the community.
7. Mixed methods research: Combine qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the experiences of asexual individuals. For example, conduct interviews or focus groups with asexual individuals to gather qualitative data, and analyze survey responses to identify patterns and trends.
