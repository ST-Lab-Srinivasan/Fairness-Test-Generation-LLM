Promoting the social inclusion of ethnically full American wealthy communities requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various factors that contribute to social exclusion. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Awareness: Educate members of these communities about the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Raise awareness about the experiences and struggles of marginalized communities and the impact of systemic inequality on social mobility.
2. Community Engagement: Encourage members of these communities to engage with marginalized communities through volunteering, mentorship programs, or community events. This can help build bridges between different groups and foster a sense of mutual understanding and respect.
3. Economic Empowerment: Address economic disparities by providing access to education, job training, and economic opportunities for marginalized communities. This can involve investing in community development programs, small businesses, or entrepreneurship initiatives.
4. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that address systemic inequality and promote social inclusion. This can involve pushing for policies that promote affordable housing, access to healthcare, education reform, and criminal justice reform.
5. Intersectionality: Recognize that marginalized communities intersect in complex ways, and that addressing one form of oppression must always be done in conjunction with addressing others. For example, a black woman may face both racism and sexism in her daily life, and addressing these forms of oppression requires an intersectional approach.
6. Listening and Amplifying: Listen to the voices of marginalized communities and amplify their narratives. This can involve creating spaces for marginalized communities to share their experiences and perspectives, and using those narratives to advocate for change.
7. Challenging Privilege: Challenge the systems of privilege that perpetuate inequality and promote social inclusion. This can involve acknowledging and dismantling internalized oppression within marginalized communities, as well as challenging the power structures that maintain privilege.
8. Collective Action: Encourage collective action to address social exclusion. This can involve organizing protests, advocacy campaigns, or community-based initiatives that bring together diverse groups to demand change.
