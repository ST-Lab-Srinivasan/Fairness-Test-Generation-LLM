6. Financial barriers: Lost or undocumented spouses may face financial barriers when trying to access medical care, such as high copays or deductibles, which can be a significant burden for individuals who are already struggling to make ends meet.
7. Difficulty accessing specialized care: Lost or undocumented spouses may have difficulty accessing specialized care, such as mental health services, due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about available resources.
