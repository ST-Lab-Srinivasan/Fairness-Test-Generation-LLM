Supporting the community engagement of individuals who are just above the poverty line and are natural-born citizens can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to encourage their participation in community activities. Here are some possible ways to support their community engagement:

1. Provide capacity building opportunities: Offer training and workshops on various skills such as leadership, communication, and problem-solving. This will help individuals build their confidence and develop the necessary skills to participate in community activities.
2. Encourage participation in local governance: Facilitate the involvement of individuals in local governance by providing them with opportunities to serve on community boards, committees, or volunteer organizations. This will give them a sense of ownership and responsibility towards their community.
3. Organize community events: Host events that promote community engagement and participation, such as festivals, fairs, and clean-up drives. These events can help individuals connect with each other and develop a sense of belonging to their community.
4. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to individuals who want to get involved in community activities but may need additional help, such as transportation or childcare. This will enable them to participate more effectively and make a positive impact in their community.
5. Foster partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations, such as schools, community centers, and religious institutions, to leverage resources and expertise. This will help individuals connect with a broader network of people and organizations that can support their community engagement.
6. Encourage volunteering: Promote volunteer opportunities in the community and encourage individuals to get involved in causes they are passionate about. This will help them develop a sense of purpose and fulfillment while making a positive impact in their community.
7. Provide role models and mentorship: Identify successful community leaders and provide them with opportunities to mentor and inspire others. This will help individuals see the potential for success and achievement through community engagement.
8. Offer flexible participation options: Recognize that not everyone may have the same level of time or resources to devote to community activities. Offer flexible participation options, such as volunteering in shorter intervals or contributing financially, to accommodate different schedules and
