The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of heterosexual older adult people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Physical limitations: Genetic conditions can cause physical limitations that affect an older person's ability to perform daily activities, such as walking, dressing, or bathing. This can lead to a decline in independence and self-esteem.
2. Financial strain: Medical expenses related to genetic conditions can be costly, leading to financial strain on individuals and their families. This can impact an older person's ability to maintain their standard of living or even access basic necessities like food and shelter.
3. Social isolation: Genetic conditions can limit an older person's social interactions, as they may become homebound or avoid social situations due to feelings of embarrassment or shame. This can lead to loneliness and depression.
4. Emotional distress: Living with a genetic condition can cause significant emotional distress, including anxiety, depression, and stress. Older adults may also experience feelings of loss of control, fear of the future, and grief related to their condition.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Some genetic conditions may be stigmatized or misunderstood by society, leading to social isolation, discrimination, and marginalization. This can further exacerbate an older person's emotional distress and sense of loss of identity.
6. Lack of support: Older adults with genetic conditions may face a lack of understanding or support from their families, healthcare providers, or society at large. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from others.
7. Impact on caregivers: Genetic conditions can also affect the lives of older adults' caregivers, who may experience emotional distress, financial strain, and social isolation as a result of providing care.
8. Limited access to healthcare: Older adults with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing appropriate healthcare due to factors such as lack of knowledge about their condition, limited availability of specialized care, or inadequate insurance coverage.
9. Impact on quality of life: Genetic conditions can significantly impact an older person's quality of life
