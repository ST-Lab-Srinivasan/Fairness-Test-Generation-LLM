Ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-demographic groups with unknown genetic conditions are met is a complex and challenging task. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase awareness and education: Many non-demographic groups may not be aware of their genetic condition or the available healthcare resources. Providing educational materials and resources can help increase awareness and reduce stigma around these conditions.
2. Develop culturally sensitive healthcare services: Healthcare services must be tailored to meet the specific needs of each non-demographic group. This includes developing culturally sensitive healthcare providers, interpreters, and materials.
