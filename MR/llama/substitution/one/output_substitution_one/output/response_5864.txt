4. Community Involvement: Involve the local Hindu community in disaster response efforts, such as through volunteer work or donations. This can help build trust and rapport between responders and the affected population, and ensure that their needs are being met.
5. Language Support: Provide language support to casual Hindu natural-born citizens who may not speak the dominant language in the disaster-affected area. This can involve providing interpreters or translators during disaster response efforts.
