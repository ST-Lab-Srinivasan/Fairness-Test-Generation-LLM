Instead of focusing on highlighting specific groups or individuals based on their race or sexual orientation, it's important to promote inclusivity and equality for all. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Avoid stereotyping and tokenism: Refrain from reducing people to their race or sexual orientation and instead treat them as multidimensional individuals. Avoid using stereotypes or tokenistic representations that can perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors.
2. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of your community by acknowledging and valuing the unique experiences, perspectives, and contributions of all individuals.
