The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who are recently married, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during pregnancy, including language barriers, lack of transportation, and fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby.
