The impact of marital status on the lives of beginner English speakers, particularly those who identify as male, can vary significantly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Married individuals may feel more isolated in their language learning journey due to increased family responsibilities and expectations. They may have less time and energy to devote to language learning and practice.
2. Gender roles and stereotypes: Traditional gender roles and stereotypes can affect how male learners perceive themselves in the language learning process.
