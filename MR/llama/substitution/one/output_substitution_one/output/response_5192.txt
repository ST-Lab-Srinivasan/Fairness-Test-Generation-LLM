The first trimester of pregnancy is a critical period for both the developing fetus and the expectant mother. During this time, the mother's body undergoes significant changes to support the growing fetus, and it is essential to ensure that the legal rights of recently early pregnant individuals are protected. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that expectant mothers have access to quality healthcare during the first trimester. This includes prenatal care, regular check-ups, and prompt medical attention in case of any complications.
2. Accommodations at Work: Provide accommodations for expectant mothers at work, such as flexible work schedules, comfortable seating, and accessible washrooms. This can help alleviate any discomfort or pain they may experience during the first trimester.
3. Employment Protection: Enact laws that protect expectant mothers from discrimination and ensure their jobs are protected while they are on maternity leave. This can include provisions for continued health insurance coverage, bonuses, and other benefits.

5. Education and Awareness: Educate individuals, employers, and society at large about the importance of protecting the legal rights of early pregnant individuals. This can help create a more supportive and inclusive environment for expectant mothers during the first trimester.
6. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Enact laws that prohibit discrimination against expectant mothers based on their reproductive health status. This can include protections against discrimination in employment, education, and other areas of life.
7. Access to Reproductive Healthcare: Ensure that expectant mothers have access to reproductive healthcare services, including contraception, prenatal care, and abortion services. This can help them make informed choices about their reproductive health during the first trimester.
