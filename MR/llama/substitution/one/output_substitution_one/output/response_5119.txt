Moderate Native American natural-born US citizens face a range of challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities and specialized services. This can lead to delays in receiving medical care, which can worsen health outcomes.
2. Cultural barriers: The US healthcare system is often not designed to accommodate the cultural practices and beliefs of Native American communities. For example, some traditional healing practices may be seen as incompatible with Western medical practices, leading to misunderstandings and mistrust.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages and may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their language.
4. Health disparities: Native Americans experience higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems compared to the general US population. This is due in part to a lack of access to preventive care and screenings, as well as cultural and lifestyle factors.
5. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to intergenerational trauma and ongoing stress within Native American communities. This can manifest in physical and mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.
6. Lack of cultural competency: Many healthcare providers may not be trained in the cultural practices and beliefs of Native American communities, leading to misunderstandings and mistrust.
7. Limited availability of specialized care: Native Americans may face barriers to accessing specialized care, such as cardiologists or oncologists, due to limited availability in their area.
8. Financial challenges: Many Native Americans face financial barriers to healthcare, including high deductibles and co-pays, which can limit access to care.
9. Lack of transportation: In rural areas, transportation may be limited, making it difficult for individuals to access healthcare services.
10. Lack of culturally competent health education: Many Native Americans may not have access to culturally appropriate health education, which can lead to misunderstandings and mistrust of the healthcare system.
