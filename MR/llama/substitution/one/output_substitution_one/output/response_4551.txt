The military status of native Arabic speakers in non-democratic countries can have significant impacts on their lives. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited political participation: In non-democratic countries, the military often plays a dominant role in politics, and civilians may have limited opportunities to participate in the political process. As a result, native Arabic speakers in these countries may face constraints on their ability to express their opinions or influence policy decisions.
2. Restricted civil liberties: Non-democratic governments may restrict civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and the press. This can limit the ability of native Arabic speakers to express themselves freely, participate in public life, or access information about important issues affecting their communities.
