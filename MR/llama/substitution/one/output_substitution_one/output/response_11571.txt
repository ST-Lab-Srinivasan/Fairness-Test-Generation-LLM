Introduction:

Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly during times of crisis such as when they are recently resettled in a new country like the US. As a third-trimester pregnant recent refugee, the individual may face unique challenges related to their marital status. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently resettled pregnant refugee women in the US.

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that refugees often experience significant stress and trauma during their resettlement, particularly those who are pregnant or have young children (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2017). These challenges can be exacerbated by the individual's marital status. For example, married refugee women may face additional stressors related to their spouse's mental and physical health, as well as the impact of their resettlement on their family dynamics (Hossain & Moore, 2016).

On the other hand, unmarried refugee women may face unique challenges related to their social isolation and lack of support networks (Krishnan-Sarin & Shorey, 2014). Additionally, they may be more vulnerable to violence and exploitation due to their gender and immigration status (United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, 2015).

Research Questions:

1. How do recently resettled pregnant refugee women in the US experience the impact of marital status on their lives?
2. What are the unique challenges faced by married and unmarried refugee women during the third trimester of pregnancy?
3. How can healthcare providers and organizations support recently resettled pregnant refugee women to address these challenges?

Methods:

This study will use a qualitative research approach, including in-depth interviews with recently resettled pregnant refugee women in the US. Participants will be recruited through partner organizations that provide services to refugees and immigrants. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.
