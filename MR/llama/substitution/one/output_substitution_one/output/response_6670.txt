To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Chinese speakers who are not recently single students are met, here are some strategies and recommendations:

1. Assess their language proficiency level: Before creating a learning plan, assess the learners' current language proficiency level to determine their strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement. This will help teachers tailor their instruction to meet the learners' individual needs.
2. Use diverse teaching methods: Incorporate various teaching methods, such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning, to cater to different learning styles. For example, some students may prefer to watch videos or listen to podcasts, while others may benefit from interactive activities like role-playing or group discussions.
3. Encourage peer learning: Pair beginner Chinese speakers with more advanced learners or native speakers. This can help the former improve their language skills through conversation and interaction with peers who are further along in their language journey.
4. Provide opportunities for authentic language use: Offer opportunities for learners to use Chinese in real-life situations, such as ordering food at a restaurant or participating in a cultural event. This can help them develop practical communication skills and build confidence in their ability to use the language.
5. Incorporate culture and history: Teach learners about China's rich cultural heritage and historical context to help them better understand the language and its nuances. For example, discussing traditional Chinese festivals or customs can help learners appreciate the importance of language in shaping cultural identity.
6. Use technology: Utilize digital resources, such as language learning apps, online courses, or virtual reality environments, to engage learners and provide personalized feedback. These tools can also offer flexibility and convenience for learners who may have busy schedules or limited access to traditional classroom instruction.
7. Encourage self-directed learning: Motivate learners to take ownership of their language learning by providing them with resources and activities they can use independently, such as language learning games, podcasts, or online communities. This can help build their autonomy and independence in language learning.
8. Provide feedback and support: Offer regular feedback and support to learners to help them improve their language skills. This can include correcting errors,
