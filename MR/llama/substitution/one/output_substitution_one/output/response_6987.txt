Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout Hindu lower-class individuals requires understanding and addressing the social, economic, and cultural barriers that prevent them from participating in cultural activities. Here are some strategies to achieve this goal:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to lower-class individuals by providing affordable or free admission, flexible scheduling, and location accessibility. For example, hosting events in community centers or temples can make it easier for people who may not have transportation or money for tickets.
2. Language: Use simple language and explain cultural concepts in a way that is easy to understand for lower-class individuals who may not have had exposure to Hinduism or may have limited education. Provide translation services during events or offer written materials in local languages.
3. Inclusive content: Create programs that are inclusive of diverse perspectives and experiences. For example, include stories and art forms from different regions of India, and highlight the contributions of marginalized communities to Hindu culture.
4. Participation: Encourage participation from lower-class individuals by offering opportunities for them to share their thoughts, ideas, and talents. This can be done through workshops, training programs, or simply by inviting them to participate in events.
5. Collaboration: Collaborate with local organizations, community groups, and religious leaders to reach a wider audience and build trust among lower-class individuals. This can involve partnering on cultural events, providing resources and support, and advocating for their rights and interests.
6. Education: Provide educational resources and workshops that teach about Hindu culture and traditions in an inclusive and respectful manner. This can help build understanding and appreciation of Hinduism among lower-class individuals and promote cultural exchange.
7. Economic empowerment: Address the economic barriers to participation by providing financial support or resources for lower-class individuals to access cultural programs. This can involve offering scholarships, grants, or subsidies to help cover event costs or provide financial assistance for educational programs.
8. Community engagement: Engage with local communities and involve them in the planning and execution of cultural events. This can help build trust and buy-in among lower-class individuals and create a sense of ownership and pride in the cultural program
