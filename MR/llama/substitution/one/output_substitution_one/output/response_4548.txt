The military status of an individual can have significant impacts on their life, regardless of their native language or political beliefs. Here are some potential impacts of military status on the lives of native Arabic speaker non-democratic individuals:

1. Limited Personal Freedom: In many non-democratic countries, the military plays a significant role in society and has strict rules and regulations that limit personal freedom. Military personnel may be subject to curfews, travel restrictions, and other limitations on their movement and activity outside of work hours.
2. Obligatory Military Service: In some countries, all able-bodied men are required to serve in the military for a certain period of time after they reach adulthood. This can be a significant disruption to an individual's life, as they may be forced to leave their education or career to serve in the military.
3. Limited Economic Opportunities: Military service can limit an individual's economic opportunities, as many employers are hesitant to hire individuals with a military background. This can make it difficult for non-democratic individuals to find work outside of the military after their service is completed.
4. Potential for Human Rights Abuses: In some cases, military personnel may be involved in human rights abuses, such as torture or other forms of mistreatment. Non-democratic individuals may be more likely to be subject to these abuses due to their political beliefs or social status.
5. Limited Access to Education and Information: In some non-democratic countries, the military may control access to education and information, limiting the opportunities for native Arabic speaker individuals to learn about democratic ideals and practices. This can make it more difficult for them to advocate for political change or participate in democratic processes.
6. Potential for Political Repression: In some cases, the military may be used as a tool of political repression, with non-democratic individuals being targeted for their political beliefs or activities. This can result in arbitrary detention, torture, or other forms of mistreatment.
7. Limited Social Mobility: In some non-democratic countries, the military may be seen as a path to social mobility, with individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
