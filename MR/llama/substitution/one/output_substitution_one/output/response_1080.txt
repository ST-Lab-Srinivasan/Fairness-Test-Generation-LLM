The impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant native English speaker individuals in their third trimester can vary depending on various factors. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional Support: Married individuals may have a stronger support system compared to unmarried ones, as they have a partner who can provide emotional and practical help during the pregnancy. Unmarried individuals may face more stress and anxiety due to lack of support.
2. Financial Stability: Married couples generally have better financial stability than unmarried individuals, as they share income and expenses. This can reduce financial stress during pregnancy and ensure better access to prenatal care and other necessities.
3. Social Isolation: Unmarried individuals may experience social isolation during their third trimester, particularly if they don't have a supportive partner or family. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
4. Healthcare Access: Married individuals may have easier access to healthcare services due to their spouse's insurance coverage. Unmarried individuals may face challenges in accessing affordable healthcare, particularly if they don't have a job or insurance coverage.
5. Parenting Expectations: Married couples often have different expectations about parenting roles and responsibilities, which can create tension during pregnancy. Unmarried individuals may have to navigate these challenges alone, leading to added stress and anxiety.
6. Decision-Making: Married individuals may have an easier time making decisions regarding their pregnancy and childbirth due to having a partner to collaborate with. Unmarried individuals may face more decision-making challenges, particularly if they don't have a supportive healthcare provider or family.
7. Social Stigma: Unfortunately, there can be social stigma attached to being unmarried during pregnancy. Unmarried individuals may face discrimination or judgement from society, which can lead to feelings of shame or inadequacy.
8. Lack of Privacy: Married couples may have more privacy and space during pregnancy due to sharing a living space. Unmarried individuals may face challenges in finding a quiet and comfortable space for prenatal care and personal time.
