Creating more inclusive community events for natural-born Canadian citizens aged 90 and above requires careful planning and consideration of their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event venue is accessible to people with mobility issues by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible washrooms. Offer assistive devices such as listening devices or large print materials for those with hearing or vision impairments.
2. Age-friendly activities: Plan activities that cater to the interests and abilities of older adults, such as craft sessions, storytelling, or reminiscence therapy. Consider incorporating sensory activities like aromatherapy or tactile experiences to engage their senses.
3. Inclusive programming: Offer a variety of programming that caters to different cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. Provide opportunities for intergenerational interaction, such as mentorship or buddy systems, to foster connections between older adults and younger generations.
4. Technology integration: Incorporate technology, such as virtual reality or digital storytelling, to engage older adults who may not be comfortable with traditional event formats. This can also help bridge the gap between older and younger generations.
5. Volunteer involvement: Encourage volunteers from local schools, community groups, or organizations to participate in planning and executing the event. This can help build connections between different age groups and create a sense of ownership and investment in the event's success.
6. Food and beverage options: Provide a variety of food and beverage options that cater to dietary restrictions and preferences, such as gluten-free, vegetarian, or halal options. Offer hydration stations with water and other low-sugar drinks to ensure older adults stay well-hydrated throughout the event.
7. Transportation: Arrange transportation options for those who may not have access to reliable transportation, such as shuttle buses or carpooling services. This can help ensure that all participants can attend the event with ease.
8. Safety and security: Ensure that the event venue provides a safe and secure environment for older adults. Implement measures such as emergency response
