Creating more inclusive cultural programs for spouses who are not disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your cultural events more accessible and inclusive:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Engage people with different backgrounds, cultures, and abilities in the planning process to ensure that the program is representative of your community.
2. Accessibility features: Consider adding accessibility features such as wheelchair-accessible spaces, Braille signage, audio descriptions, or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation.
3. Accommodate different learning styles: Offer a variety of ways for people to engage with the cultural program, such as visual aids, written materials, or interactive activities.
4. Provide clear instructions: Make sure that all participants have access to clear and concise instructions on how to participate in the cultural program. This can include providing information in multiple formats, such as large print, audio, or digital copies.
5. Offer flexible participation options: Allow participants to choose how they want to engage with the cultural program, such as attending in person or virtually, or participating in a particular activity or not.
6. Train staff and volunteers: Provide training for staff and volunteers on disability etiquette, accessibility, and inclusive practices to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included.
7. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the cultural program space is physically accessible and free from barriers, such as stairs or narrow hallways. Also, create a welcoming atmosphere by using positive language and visual cues that promote inclusivity.
8. Offer additional support: Provide additional support for participants who may need it, such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, cued speech, or audio descriptions.
9. Involve the community: Encourage community members to participate in the cultural program by sharing their experiences, traditions, and stories. This can help create a more inclusive and diverse cultural program.
10. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate and improve the accessibility and inclusiveness of your cultural programs based on feedback from participants and stakeholders.
