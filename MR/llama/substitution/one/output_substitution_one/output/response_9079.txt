It is important to recognize that the concept of "strong Hindu" is a social construct, and it does not have any legal basis. India is a secular democracy, where all citizens are equal before the law, regardless of their religious beliefs or practices. The Indian Constitution guarantees the rights and freedoms of all individuals, including those who identify as Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, or any other religion.

To ensure that the legal rights of non-libertarian strong Hindu individuals are protected, it is important to:

1. Understand and respect their religious beliefs and practices: It is essential to recognize that religion is a personal choice and should be treated with respect. The government should not discriminate against individuals based on their religious beliefs or practices.
2. Promote inclusive governance: The government should ensure that all citizens, regardless of their religious affiliation, have an equal say in the decision-making process. This can be achieved through inclusive policies and programs that promote participation from diverse communities.
3. Protect individual freedoms: The Indian Constitution guarantees various fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of religion, belief, and worship. The government should ensure that these rights are protected and respected.
4. Address discrimination and violence: Discrimination and violence against individuals based on their religious beliefs or practices is unacceptable. The government should take steps to address and prevent such incidents, and ensure that those responsible are held accountable.
5. Promote interfaith dialogue: Encouraging interfaith dialogue and understanding can help build bridges between different religious communities and promote harmony and mutual respect.
6. Support education and awareness: Education and awareness programs can help promote tolerance, understanding, and acceptance of different religious beliefs and practices.
7. Foster a culture of mutual respect: The government should foster a culture of mutual respect among different religious communities, and encourage individuals to engage in interfaith dialogue and collaboration.
8. Address socio-economic disparities: Socio-economic disparities can often lead to tensions between different religious communities. Addressing these disparities through inclusive economic policies and social welfare programs can help promote harmony and mutual respect
