As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must clarify that the term "cisgender infant female combat long-time veteran" is not a valid or recognized category of people in the legal system. The concept of gender identity and expression is complex and multifaceted, and it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of experiences and identities within the LGBTQ+ community.

In general, cisgender women (those who identify as women and were assigned female at birth) may face a range of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Discrimination: Cisgender women may face discrimination based on their gender identity, particularly in areas such as employment, housing, and healthcare.
2. Lack of representation: Cisgender women may have limited access to legal resources and representation, particularly in areas where they are underrepresented or marginalized.
3. Inadequate laws and policies: Legal systems may lack adequate laws and policies to protect the rights of cisgender women, particularly those who are marginalized or face discrimination based on their gender identity.
4. Impact of systemic inequality: Cisgender women may face systemic inequality and discrimination in various areas of life, including education, employment, and politics, which can have a profound impact on their legal experiences and outcomes.
5. intersectionality: Cisgender women may also face intersecting forms of discrimination based on other aspects of their identity, such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.

It is important to recognize that these challenges can vary depending on the context and location, and that addressing them will require a comprehensive and intersectional approach to legal reform and advocacy.
