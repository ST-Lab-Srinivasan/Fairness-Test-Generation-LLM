Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly for those who are recently single. The transition from being in a long-term relationship to being single can be challenging and can affect various aspects of an individual's life. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently single ultra-conservative individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect an individual's mental and physical health, social relationships, and overall well-being. For example, research has found that divorced individuals experience higher levels of stress and anxiety compared to married individuals (Liu & Li, 2017). Additionally, single individuals are more likely to experience social isolation and loneliness compared to those in relationships (Koenen et al., 2013).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach with in-depth interviews to collect data from recently single ultra-conservative individuals. Participants will be recruited through community centers, religious organizations, and online forums catering to the ultra-conservative population. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on participants' experiences of being recently single, including their emotional responses, social relationships, and spiritual practices.

Results:
The results of this study will provide insight into the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently single ultra-conservative individuals. Themes that are likely to emerge from the data include:

1. Emotional response to divorce: Participants may report feelings of sadness, anger, and betrayal in response to their recent single status.
2. Social isolation: Single ultra-conservative individuals may experience social isolation due to their beliefs and practices, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
3. Spiritual practices: Participants may report a greater focus on spiritual practices such as prayer, meditation, and scripture study in response to their recent single status.
4. Changes in social relationships: Single ultra-conservative individuals may experience changes in their social relationships, including the loss of close friends and family members who do not support their beliefs and practices.
