It is important to recognize that the healthcare needs of LGBTQ+ individuals may differ from those of non-LGBTQ+ individuals due to a variety of factors, including historical discrimination, stigma, and marginalization. As such, it is crucial to create inclusive and affirming healthcare environments that are aware of these differences and provide tailored care to meet the unique needs of LGBTQ+ individuals.
