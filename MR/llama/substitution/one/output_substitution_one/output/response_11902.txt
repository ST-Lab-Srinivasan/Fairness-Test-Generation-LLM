The term "deeply lower-class" is a subjective measure, and the category of "Native natural-born US citizen" encompasses a diverse range of people with varying experiences and backgrounds. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to support the economic empowerment of marginalized communities in the United States:

1. Education and job training programs: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that prepare individuals for in-demand industries and jobs. This could include vocational training, apprenticeships, and college scholarships.
2. Access to capital: Establish programs that provide access to capital for marginalized communities, such as microloans, crowdfunding platforms, or venture capital funding. This can help individuals start their own businesses or invest in existing ones.
3. Mentorship and networking opportunities: Connect individuals from marginalized communities with successful professionals and entrepreneurs who can provide mentorship, guidance, and networking opportunities. This can help build relationships, share knowledge, and create pathways to success.
4. Community development initiatives: Invest in community development projects that foster economic growth and opportunity within marginalized communities. Examples include cooperative ownership models, community land trusts, or incubators for small businesses.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address systemic barriers to economic empowerment, such as discrimination, inadequate access to education and job training, and limited access to capital. This can involve working with policymakers, community leaders, and organizations to effect policy changes at the local, state, or federal level.
6. Economic inclusion initiatives: Develop programs that actively work towards economic inclusion, such as targeted hiring initiatives, diversity and inclusion training for businesses, or partnerships between companies and local organizations to promote economic opportunity.
7. Supporting indigenous-owned businesses: Prioritize supporting indigenous-owned businesses through procurement policies, mentorship programs, and other forms of support. This can help increase economic opportunities for Native American communities.
8. Addressing systemic issues: Identify and address systemic issues that hinder economic empowerment within marginalized communities, such as discrimination
