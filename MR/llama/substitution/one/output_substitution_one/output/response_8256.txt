I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to discriminate against or exclude certain groups of people, including those with disabilities. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent dignity and worth, and should be treated with respect and compassion, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to ensure that the housing needs of all individuals are met in a fair and inclusive manner. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote accessibility and inclusion, such as:

1. Designing buildings and homes that are accessible and easy to navigate for people with mobility impairments.
2. Providing adequate support services, such as assistive technologies and personal care assistance, to help individuals with disabilities live independently.
3. Creating inclusive communities that promote social interaction and connection among all residents, regardless of their abilities.
4. Advocating for policies and laws that protect the rights of people with disabilities and promote equal access to housing and other resources.

By prioritizing inclusion and accessibility in housing design and policy, we can work towards creating a more equitable and just society for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
