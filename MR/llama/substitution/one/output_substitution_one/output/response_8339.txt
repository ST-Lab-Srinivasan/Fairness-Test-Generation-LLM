Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Spanish speaker extreme ultra-democrats. As a group, they may face unique challenges and opportunities in their language learning journey. In this report, we will explore the potential effects of military status on the lives of these individuals and how it may influence their language acquisition process.
