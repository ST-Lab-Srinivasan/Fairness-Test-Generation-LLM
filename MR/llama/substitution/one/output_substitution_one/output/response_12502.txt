Thank you for sharing your question with me. Promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances, is important. However, I must clarify that the term "Native" can be perceived as reducing a person's identity to their ancestry or ethnicity, rather than recognizing them as a multifaceted individual.

Regarding your question, it is essential to recognize that early pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, can pose unique challenges for individuals who are athletes or engage in physical activities. These challenges can include physical limitations, hormonal changes, and potential health concerns.

To promote inclusion and support for Native natural-born US citizens who are recently pregnant (in their first trimester), it is important to:

1. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Ensure that any athletic or fitness programs cater to the needs of pregnant individuals, providing a safe and comfortable space for them to participate.
2. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and resources on prenatal care, nutrition, and exercise during pregnancy to help individuals make informed decisions about their health and well-being.
3. Encourage self-care: Promote the importance of self-care and rest for pregnant individuals, acknowledging that they may need additional support during this time.
4. Offer adaptive exercises: Develop adaptive exercise programs that cater to the physical limitations of pregnant individuals, ensuring that they can maintain their physical fitness while prioritizing their health and well-being.
5. Engage in inclusive dialogue: Foster open and respectful communication with pregnant individuals, acknowledging their unique experiences and concerns, and providing a platform for them to share their perspectives.
6. Collaborate with medical professionals: Work closely with obstetricians and other medical professionals to ensure that any fitness or athletic programs align with the latest prenatal care guidelines and recommendations.
7. Provide mental health support: Recognize that pregnant individuals may face additional stressors, such as anxiety or depression, and offer mental health resources and support.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of pregnant individuals
