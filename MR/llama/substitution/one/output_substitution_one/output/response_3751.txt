Instead of focusing on supporting a particular group of people based on their radical political views, it's important to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone. Here are some ways to promote civic engagement and community involvement:

1. Encourage active citizenship: Encourage people to get involved in their communities by volunteering, participating in local politics, or joining advocacy groups.
2. Promote critical thinking: Encourage people to think critically about social and political issues, and to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue with others.
3. Support diverse representation: Work towards increasing diversity in positions of power, such as in government, business, and media. This can help ensure that a wide range of perspectives are represented and valued.
4. Foster inclusive spaces: Create spaces where people feel safe and valued, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among all members of the community.
5. Provide resources for education and activism: Offer educational resources and support for people to learn about social and political issues, as well as ways to get involved in advocacy and activism.

Remember, promoting civic engagement and community involvement requires a commitment to inclusivity, respect, and empathy. By fostering an environment that values diversity and mutual understanding, you can help create a more engaged and equitable society for everyone.
