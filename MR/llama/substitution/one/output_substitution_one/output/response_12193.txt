Highlighting the issues faced by "slightly bisexual" and newly single individuals can be a challenging task as these groups are often marginalized or overlooked in mainstream LGBTQ+ discourse. However, there are several ways to use data to shed light on their experiences:

1. Conduct surveys or focus groups: Reach out to organizations that cater to bisexual and single individuals, such as the Bisexuality Advocacy Group or the National Single People's Awareness Day. They may be able to provide you with contact information for people who fit your criteria. Alternatively, you can use online survey tools like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to collect data from a diverse sample of participants. Make sure to include questions that are inclusive and respectful of the respondents' identities.
2. Analyze existing data: Look for existing studies or reports that have collected data on bisexual and single individuals. You can search academic databases like JSTOR, PsycINFO, or Google Scholar, or consult reports from organizations like the Pew Research Center or the Williams Institute. Pay attention to any trends or patterns that emerge in the data, such as differences in mental health outcomes or relationship satisfaction compared to their heterosexual and non-single counterparts.
3. Map geographic patterns: Use geospatial analysis software like ArcGIS or QGIS to map the locations of bisexual and single individuals. You can explore how these groups are distributed across different regions, urban versus rural areas, or even neighborhoods within cities. This can help identify potential pockets of resistance or support for these communities.
4. Leverage social media data: Collect Twitter data using tools like Tweepy or Python's tweepy library, or use Facebook's APIs to collect data on hashtags related to bisexuality and singleness. Analyze the sentiment and frequency of posts to gauge public opinion and awareness around these issues. You can also use network analysis tools like Gephi or NetworkX to examine the structure of online communities and identify key influencers or leaders in the space.
5. Conduct a content analysis: Use natural language processing techniques to analyze a corpus of texts, such as articles, blogs, or social media posts, that mention bisexuality or singleness
