Ensuring that the voices of long-term recent immigrants in their late 30s are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to create inclusive environments and mechanisms for participation. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Language support: Provide language support services, such as interpretation or translation, to ensure that individuals who may not speak the dominant language fluently can participate in decision-making processes.
2. Cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for decision-makers and other stakeholders to better understand the experiences and perspectives of immigrant communities.
3. Community outreach: Engage with immigrant communities through community events, outreach programs, and partnerships with organizations that serve these populations. This helps build trust and increases the likelihood of their voices being heard.
4. Representative participation: Ensure that immigrant representatives are included in decision-making processes, such as advisory committees or task forces. This can help ensure that their perspectives are taken into account and that they have a voice in shaping decisions that affect their lives.
5. Digital engagement: Utilize digital platforms to engage with immigrant communities, such as online surveys, social media, or mobile apps. This can help reach a wider audience and provide more accessible means of participation for individuals who may face barriers to in-person participation.
6. Capacity building: Provide capacity-building opportunities for immigrant leaders and organizations, enabling them to advocate more effectively for their communities' interests.
7. Networking: Connect immigrant leaders with decision-makers and other stakeholders to build relationships and increase the likelihood of their voices being heard.
8. Media outreach: Utilize media platforms to amplify the voices of immigrants, sharing their stories and perspectives with a wider audience. This can help raise awareness and build support for their issues among the broader public.
9. Policy advocacy: Advocate for policies that promote immigrant inclusion and address the specific needs and challenges faced by this population.
10. Monitoring and evaluation: Regularly monitor and evaluate decision-making processes to ensure that they are inclusive and responsive to the needs of immigrant communities
