Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have far-reaching consequences for an individual's emotional, social, and economic well-being. When a marriage ends in divorce or separation, it can be a challenging and stressful time for the individuals involved. This study aims to explore the impact of marital status on the lives of recently single moderate individuals, focusing on their emotional, social, and economic experiences.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that divorce and separation can have both positive and negative impacts on individuals. On the one hand, divorce can provide an opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery, as well as greater autonomy and independence (Rogers & Bumpass, 1987). On the other hand, it can also lead to feelings of loss, grief, and emotional distress (Komarovsky & Stueber, 1996).

The impact of marital status on mental health has been well-documented in the literature. Studies have shown that recently single individuals are at a higher risk of developing depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems compared to their married counterparts (Brown et al., 2017). This may be due to the loss of social support and the transition from a dual-income household to a single-income one.

Social isolation is another common experience among recently single individuals. The breakdown of a marriage can lead to a decrease in social interactions, which can further exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection (Murphy & Mills, 2017). This can be particularly challenging for individuals who relied heavily on their spouse for social support.

In terms of economic impacts, divorce can lead to a significant reduction in income due to the loss of dual-income earnings (Hill, 2016). This can make it difficult for recently single individuals to maintain their standard of living or save money for the future.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from recently single moderate individuals. Participants will be recruited through local support groups and online forums, with a focus on those who have been single for
