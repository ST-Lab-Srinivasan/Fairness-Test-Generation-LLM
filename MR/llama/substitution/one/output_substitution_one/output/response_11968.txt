1. Social isolation: Physical disabilities can limit a person's mobility, making it difficult to participate in social activities or maintain relationships with friends and family.
2. Employment barriers: Many physically disabled veterans face discrimination or bias in the workplace, which can limit their job opportunities or prevent them from advancing in their careers.
