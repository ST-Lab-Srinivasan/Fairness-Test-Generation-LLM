Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for moderate, non-lifelong married individuals can be achieved by acknowledging and respecting the diverse ways that people form and maintain meaningful relationships. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize the diversity of relationship models: Cultural celebrations should recognize that not everyone is in a traditional marriage or has a lifelong partnership. Be open to recognizing and celebrating other forms of meaningful relationships, such as long-term cohabitation, domestic partnerships, or non-traditional unions.
2. Incorporate inclusive language: Use language that acknowledges the diversity of relationship models. For example, instead of using terms like "husband" and "wife," use more inclusive language such as "partner," "spouse," or "significant other."
3. Be mindful of representation: Make sure that the cultural celebrations are representative of the diverse relationships in your community. This can be achieved by including a variety of relationship models in the celebration, such as same-sex couples, interracial couples, and polyamorous relationships.
4. Offer inclusive activities: Provide activities that are inclusive of all relationship models. For example, instead of having a traditional "husband and wife" dance, have a "couple's dance" where any two people can participate.
5. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural celebration is a safe and welcoming space for everyone, regardless of their relationship model. This can be achieved by providing a code of conduct or guidelines that promote respect and inclusivity.
6. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the diverse relationship models in your community. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and acceptance.
7. Encourage participation: Make sure that all individuals, regardless of their relationship model, feel welcome and encouraged to participate in the cultural celebration. Provide opportunities for people to share their experiences and traditions.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of relationship models and cultures. Use the cultural celebration as an opportunity to learn from and appreciate the unique customs and traditions of each individual or group.
9. Be flexible: Be open to changes and adaptations in the cultural celebration based
