I cannot provide advice or support on promoting discrimination or exclusion based on someone's religion, race, or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or beliefs.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of life, including athletics. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Encourage diversity and inclusion: Foster an environment that values and embraces diversity, including cultural, religious, and ethnic differences. Promote inclusive practices and language, and avoid discriminatory behaviors or attitudes.
2. Provide opportunities for underrepresented groups: Identify barriers that may prevent individuals from underrepresented groups from participating in athletics, such as lack of access to resources or facilities, and work to address them. Offer scholarships, mentorship programs, or other forms of support to help level the playing field.
3. Challenge stereotypes and biases: Educate yourself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by individuals from underrepresented groups in athletics. Challenge harmful stereotypes and biases, and promote respectful attitudes towards all individuals, regardless of their background.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that athletic spaces are welcoming and inclusive for everyone, including those from underrepresented groups. Provide safe and accessible facilities, and promote a culture of mutual respect and inclusion.
5. Celebrate diversity: Highlight the achievements and contributions of individuals from underrepresented groups in athletics, and celebrate their diversity as a source of strength and inspiration. Encourage others to do the same, and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable environment for all.

Remember, promoting inclusion and diversity in athletics requires ongoing effort and commitment. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
