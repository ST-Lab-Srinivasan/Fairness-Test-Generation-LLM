Introduction:
Carriers of genetic conditions and recent refugees face unique healthcare challenges in the United States. These groups often experience barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of awareness about their specific healthcare needs. This proposal aims to address these gaps by outlining strategies for ensuring that their healthcare needs are met.

I. Identifying Healthcare Needs:
