Creating more inclusive community programs for recently retired veterans and recently single individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some strategies to help build a supportive community:

1. Acknowledge the challenges of transition: Retirement and singleshood can be significant life changes, bringing new challenges and emotions. Programs should recognize these transitions and provide support during this time.
2. Include diverse perspectives: Ensure that your programs reflect the diversity of your community, including different ages, cultures, abilities, and identities. This can be achieved by involving a variety of program leaders, mentors, and participants.
