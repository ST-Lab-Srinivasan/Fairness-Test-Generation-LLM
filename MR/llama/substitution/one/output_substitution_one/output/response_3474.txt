Supporting the economic empowerment of working-class Native American recent refugees to the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and provides tailored resources. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to education and job training: Provide access to vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and job readiness workshops that teach marketable skills such as carpentry, plumbing, electrical work, and IT. This will enable them to compete in the job market and earn a living wage.
2. Small business development: Offer microloans, mentorship, and technical assistance to help recent refugees start their own small businesses. This can include providing access to affordable commercial space, as well as training on business planning, marketing, and financial management.
3. Job placement and career advancement: Partner with local employers to provide job placement services specifically tailored to the needs of recent Native American refugees. This can include career counseling, interview preparation, and job shadowing opportunities.
4. Financial literacy and capability-building: Offer financial education workshops that teach basic budgeting, savings, and investment principles. This will help them manage their finances effectively, reduce debt, and build wealth over time.
5. Health and wellness initiatives: Provide access to affordable healthcare services, mental health counseling, and nutrition education. This can help address the unique health challenges faced by recent refugees and promote overall wellness.
6. Housing support: Offer rental assistance, home repair grants, and housing counseling services to help recent refugees secure affordable and safe housing.
7. Language access and cultural adaptation: Provide language classes and cultural orientation programs that help recent refugees navigate the local culture and access essential services.
8. Advocacy and systemic change: Advocate for policies that address the root causes of poverty and inequality faced by Native American refugees. This can include advocating for changes to immigration laws, education policies, and job training programs.
9. Community building and social connections: Organize community events, cultural activities, and social gatherings that help recent refugees connect with each other and build relationships with their new communities.
