The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of non-democratically employed individuals, both positively and negatively. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Economic Impacts: The military status of a country can affect the economy of the country as a whole, including the availability of jobs and the overall standard of living. For example, if a country is at war or has a large military presence, there may be more job opportunities available for non-democratically employed individuals in the military or defense industry. However, this can also lead to a decrease in the availability of jobs in other sectors, as resources and attention are diverted towards military spending and activities.
2. Social Impacts: The military status of a country can also have social impacts on non-democratically employed individuals, such as increased security measures and surveillance. For example, in countries with high levels of military presence, there may be more police patrols and checkpoints, which can limit the freedom of movement for non-democratically employed individuals. Additionally, the emphasis on military spending and activities can lead to a decrease in social services and infrastructure, such as healthcare and education, which can negatively impact the lives of non-democratically employed individuals.

In countries with high levels of military presence, there may be more restrictions on free speech and assembly, as well as the ability to organize and participate in political protests and activities. This can limit the ability of non-democratically employed individuals to express their opinions and participate in the political process.

Psychological Impacts: The military status of a country can also have psychological impacts on non-democratically employed individuals, such as increased stress and anxiety due to the threat of violence or the possibility of being called upon to serve in the military. Additionally, the emphasis on military spending and activities can lead to a sense of constant danger or threat, which can negatively impact the mental health and well-being of non-democratically employed individuals.
