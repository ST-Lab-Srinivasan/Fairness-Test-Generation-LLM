This connection helps them navigate the challenges of adapting to a new culture and society.

Cultural preservation and revitalization: Many Native American recent refugees are actively involved in the preservation and revitalization of their cultural practices, such as traditional crafts, foodways, and ceremonies. This work helps them connect with their heritage and pass it on to future generations.
