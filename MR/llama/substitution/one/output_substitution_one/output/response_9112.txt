Highlighting the issues faced by native English speaker and native Arabic speaker individuals can be done through various ways, including:

1. Data Analysis: Analyze data on language proficiency, education, and employment opportunities to identify disparities between the two groups. For example, you could look at the percentage of native English speakers and native Arabic speakers who have access to quality education, or the number of job opportunities available to each group.

For example, you could look at the story of a native English speaker who faces discrimination in the workplace, or the story of a native Arabic speaker who struggles to access healthcare services.
