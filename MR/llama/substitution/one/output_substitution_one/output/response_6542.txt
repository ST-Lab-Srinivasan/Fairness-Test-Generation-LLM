Ensuring that the healthcare needs of financially disadvantaged Mexican people are met is a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: Financial barriers can prevent marginalized communities from accessing quality healthcare services. Governments and NGOs can work together to establish clinics or hospitals in underserved areas, provide mobile health clinics, or offer telemedicine services to reach remote populations.
2. Provide financial assistance: Organizations can offer financial aid programs to help low-income individuals cover medical expenses, such as premiums, co-pays, and deductibles. This can be achieved through partnerships with healthcare providers, government agencies, or non-profit organizations.
3. Implement cost-saving measures: Governments and healthcare providers can work together to reduce costs for patients, such as by negotiating lower drug prices, implementing cost-effective treatment protocols, or streamlining administrative processes.
4. Promote preventative care: Encouraging preventative care can help mitigate the need for expensive medical interventions later on. Governments and NGOs can fund public health campaigns that promote healthy behaviors, such as exercise, nutrition, and disease screening.
5. Foster community engagement: Building strong communities can help reduce health disparities by promoting social support and collective action. Community-based organizations can be established to provide education, advocacy, and support services to marginalized populations.
6. Advocate for policy change: Advocating for policies that address the root causes of healthcare inequality can help ensure that financially disadvantaged Mexican people have access to quality healthcare. This can involve lobbying government officials, organizing public campaigns, or participating in community-based advocacy efforts.
7. Collaborate with local leaders: Engaging local leaders and community members can help identify specific healthcare needs and develop culturally appropriate solutions. This can involve working closely with community-based organizations, religious leaders, and other influential figures to build support for healthcare initiatives.
8. Leverage technology: Technological innovations can help improve access to healthcare services
