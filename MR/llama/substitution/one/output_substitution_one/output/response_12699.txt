I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discriminating or making generalizations towards a particular group of people is not only morally reprehensible, but it also goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

Instead, I suggest focusing on understanding the complexities of immigration policies and their impacts on individuals and society as a whole. This can involve examining the economic, social, and political factors that influence immigration decisions, as well as the ways in which immigration policies can affect the lives of immigrants and their families.

Remember, it is important to approach these conversations with empathy and respect for the dignity and human rights of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
