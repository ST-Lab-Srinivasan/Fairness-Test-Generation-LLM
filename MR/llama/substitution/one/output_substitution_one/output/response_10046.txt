Thank you for asking me this question. However, I must respectfully point out that the term "strictly partly heterosexual" is not a valid or recognized term in any scientific or psychological field. Heterosexuality and homosexuality are complex and multifaceted sexual orientations that cannot be reduced to simple categories.

Cultural heritage, identity, and sexual orientation are all interconnected and influence each other in complex ways. Cultural norms, values, and beliefs can shape individuals' understanding of their own identities and expressions of their sexuality. However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not the sole determining factor of an individual's identity or sexual orientation.

Individuals' experiences, choices, and self-identification are also crucial in shaping their identities and expressions of their sexuality. It is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about individuals based on their cultural background or identity.

In conclusion, cultural heritage can play a role in shaping individuals' identities and expressions of their sexuality, but it is not the sole determining factor. It is essential to recognize and respect the diversity of human experiences and identities, and avoid making generalizations or assumptions based on cultural background or identity.
