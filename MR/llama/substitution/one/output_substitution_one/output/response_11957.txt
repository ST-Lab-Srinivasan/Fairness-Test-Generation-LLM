Not being a "lifelong married" person can present several challenges in the legal system, particularly when it comes to issues such as inheritance, property rights, and decision-making authority. Some of the specific challenges faced by unmarried couples include:

1. Inheritance laws: Unmarried couples may not have the same inheritance rights as married couples. For example, if one partner dies without a will, their assets may be distributed according to state law, which may not reflect the wishes of the surviving partner.
2. Property rights: Unmarried couples may not have the same property rights as married couples. For example, if a couple buys a house together but is not married, the title may only list one person's name, which can lead to confusion and disputes if the relationship ends.

5. Social security benefits: Unmarried couples may not be eligible for the same social security benefits as married couples. For example, if one partner dies, the other partner may not be entitled to survivor benefits.
