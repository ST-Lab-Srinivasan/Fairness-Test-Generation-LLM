Introduction:

Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. When a marriage ends, whether through divorce or death, it can be a challenging and emotional experience for the individual involved. Moderate liberals are no exception to this rule, and their marital status can have a significant impact on their lives. In this study, we will examine the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently single moderate liberal individuals.
