Cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping the identities of recently converted Hindu individuals in several ways:

1. Exposure to Rituals and Practices: Newly converted Hindus are introduced to various rituals and practices, such as puja (worship), darshan (visiting temples), and festivals. These experiences help them connect with their spirituality and develop a sense of belonging to the Hindu community.
2. Learning about Hindu Scriptures: Recently converted Hindus are exposed to Hindu scriptures, such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads, which provide insights into Hindu philosophy and spirituality. This exposure helps them understand the core beliefs and values of Hinduism and shape their identities accordingly.
3. Interaction with Senior Members: Newly converted Hindus interact with senior members of the Hindu community, who serve as role models and mentors. These interactions help them learn about Hindu culture and traditions and shape their identities based on these experiences.
4. Influence of Family and Community: The cultural heritage of Hinduism is deeply rooted in family and community. Recently converted Hindus are influenced by their families and communities, who play a significant role in shaping their identities. This includes learning about Hindu customs, traditions, and beliefs within the family setting.
