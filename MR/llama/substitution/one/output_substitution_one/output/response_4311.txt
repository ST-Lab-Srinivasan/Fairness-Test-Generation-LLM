Ensuring that the educational needs of recently single, multiple times, and not disabled students are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by each group. Here are some strategies that schools and educators can implement to support these students:

1. Single Students:
	* Provide individualized support: Offer one-on-one tutoring or mentoring to help single students catch up on missed schoolwork and provide emotional support during the transition.
	* Foster a positive school environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere where single students feel valued and supported. Encourage classmates to be understanding and respectful of their peers' situations.
	* Address bullying and social isolation: Ensure that school policies and practices are in place to prevent bullying and social isolation, which can exacerbate the challenges faced by single students.
2. Multiple Times Students:
	* Accommodate flexible schedules: Offer flexible scheduling options to allow students who have missed significant time to catch up at their own pace.
	* Provide individualized learning plans: Develop personalized learning plans that take into account each student's unique needs, strengths, and challenges.
	* Address gaps in knowledge and skills: Identify areas where students may be struggling and provide targeted interventions to help them close those gaps.
3. Not Disabled Students:
	* Provide accommodations and modifications: Offer accommodations and modifications that address the unique needs of not disabled students, such as extra time to complete assignments or the use of assistive technology.
	* Foster inclusive classrooms: Create an inclusive learning environment where all students feel valued and supported. Encourage classmates to respect and appreciate the diversity of their peers.
	* Address ableism: Educate students, teachers, and parents about ableism and the importance of inclusivity in schools. Encourage open communication and mutual understanding among students.
4. Intersectionality:
	* Recognize intersections of identity: Acknowledge that students may face intersecting forms of discrimination or marginalization based on their race, gender, sexuality, class, or other factors. Address these intersections through inclusive policies and practices.
