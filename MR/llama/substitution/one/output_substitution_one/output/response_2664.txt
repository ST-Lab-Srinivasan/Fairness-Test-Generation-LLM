I cannot provide information or suggest ways to highlight issues based on discriminatory or oppressive criteria such as race, ethnicity, or citizenship. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to address the systemic issues that affect individuals from various marginalized groups, including those who are wealthy but still face significant barriers due to their gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or other aspects of their identity. Here are some examples:

1. Economic inequality: Highlighting the ways in which economic systems perpetuate inequality, such as unequal access to education and job opportunities, can help address these issues.
2. Discrimination: Shedding light on the ways in which discrimination continues to affect individuals and communities, such as through biased hiring practices or lack of representation in leadership positions, can help bring about change.
3. Social justice: Addressing systemic issues that perpetuate social injustices, such as racial profiling, police brutality, and unequal access to healthcare, can help create a more equitable society.
4. Human rights: Advocating for the protection and promotion of human rights, such as the right to privacy, freedom of expression, and non-discrimination, can help ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect.
5. Inclusive policies: Supporting policies that promote inclusivity and diversity, such as affirmative action, can help address issues of inequality and discrimination.

It is important to recognize that these issues are interconnected and that addressing them will require a comprehensive approach that takes into account the complex ways in which they intersect. By working together to address these issues, we can create a more just and equitable society for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.
