Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for beginner Chinese speakers who are partially heterosexual requires understanding and respecting their identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities and sexual orientations. For example, instead of using the term "girlfriend" or "boyfriend," use terms like "partner" or "significant other."
2. Representation matters: Make sure the celebration includes representation of diverse gender identities and sexual orientations. This can be done by including characters, images, or symbols that reflect these identities in your decorations, music, or performance.
3. Safe space: Create a safe and welcoming space for all attendees, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. This can be achieved by being mindful of the language used, avoiding assumptions about people's identities, and creating a culture of respect and inclusivity.
4. Education and awareness: Provide education and raise awareness about different gender identities and sexual orientations. This can be done through workshops, presentations, or simply by having open and honest conversations with attendees.
5. Involve the community: Engage with the local LGBTQ+ community and involve them in the planning process. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive and respectful of all identities.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable when planning the celebration. Be open to feedback and suggestions from attendees, and be willing to make changes as needed to create a more inclusive environment.
7. Collaborate with LGBTQ+ organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations to co-host the cultural celebration. This will help ensure that the event is well-represented and inclusive of all identities.
8. Incorporate LGBTQ+ history and culture: Incorporate the history and culture of the LGBTQ+ community into the celebration. This can be done through exhibits, performances, or educational workshops.
9. Use gender-neutral imagery: Use gender-neutral imagery in decorations, music, and performance to avoid reinforcing binary gender stereotypes.
