Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of not only native Spanish speakers but also multiple times native speakers. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences identity formation:

1. Language and Cultural Practices: The language and cultural practices of one's ancestors can greatly impact an individual's sense of self. For example, a person who grows up speaking a variety of languages, including their parents' native tongue, may feel more connected to their cultural heritage than someone who only speaks the dominant language of their country or region.
