Ensuring the educational needs of native Arabic speakers who are recently married can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

Cultural sensitivity training for educators: Provide training and workshops for educators to understand the cultural norms and values of native Arabic speakers, particularly those related to marriage and family life. This will help them to better support these students in their academic and personal lives.
