Creating more inclusive social policies for formerly newly single permanent residents (FSNRs) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the specific challenges faced by FSNRs: FSNRs often face discrimination, stigma, and social isolation due to their immigration status. Policies should recognize these challenges and address them directly.
2. Provide access to affordable housing: Many FSNRs struggle to find affordable and secure housing. Governments can provide subsidies or tax credits for landlords who rent to FSNRs, or create specialized housing programs for this population.
