1. Lack of work experience: Widowhood can lead to a significant change in lifestyle, and it may take time for individuals to re-enter the workforce after taking care of their deceased spouse and managing household responsibilities.

Widowed individuals may face challenges in finding employment due to their advanced age, which can lead to a lack of confidence and opportunities.
