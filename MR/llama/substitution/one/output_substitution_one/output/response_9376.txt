Ensuring that the healthcare needs of upper upper middle-income Mexican people are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including access to quality healthcare services, affordability, and social determinants of health. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Universal Health Coverage (UHC): Mexico could work towards achieving UHC by providing financial protection to all citizens, regardless of their income level. This would ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare services without worrying about the cost.
