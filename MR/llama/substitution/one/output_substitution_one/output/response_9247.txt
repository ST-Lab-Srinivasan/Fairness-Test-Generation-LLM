In many countries, there are legal protections in place to support pregnant workers during their employment. However, these protections may not always be adequate or enforced properly, leading to challenges for late pregnancy (3rd trimester) employed people in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by such individuals:

1. Lack of accommodations: Many employers may not provide adequate accommodations for pregnant workers, such as modified work schedules or job assignments that allow them to continue working comfortably during their pregnancy. This can lead to physical discomfort, fatigue, and stress.
2. Pregnancy discrimination: Unfortunately, pregnancy discrimination is still a common issue in many workplaces. Some employers may view pregnant workers as a burden or a liability, leading them to make decisions that can impact the worker's career negatively. This can result in unfair treatment, reduced opportunities for advancement, or even termination of employment.
3. Limited leave options: Many countries have laws that provide for maternity leave, but the duration and conditions of this leave may be limited. For example, some countries only provide a certain number of weeks of paid leave, while others may not provide any paid leave at all. This can put a significant financial strain on families, particularly if they rely on the mother's income.
4. Returning to work after maternity leave: When pregnant workers return to their jobs after maternity leave, they may face challenges such as inadequate support from their employers, limited opportunities for advancement, or a lack of understanding from colleagues and supervisors about the needs of new mothers.
5. Lack of breastfeeding support: Many workplaces do not provide adequate support for breastfeeding employees, such as private spaces for feeding or storage for expressed milk. This can make it difficult for new mothers to balance their work and breastfeeding responsibilities.
6. Limited career advancement opportunities: Pregnant workers may face limited career advancement opportunities due to stereotypes or biases about women's ability to perform certain jobs while pregnant or after giving birth. This can lead to a lack of representation
