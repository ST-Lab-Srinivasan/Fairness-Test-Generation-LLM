I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on race or ethnicity. All students, regardless of their background, deserve equal opportunities and resources to succeed in their education. The term "ethnically full Caucasian extreme soft libertarian students" is problematic as it reinforces harmful stereotypes and divisions.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment that values diversity and promotes equal opportunities for all students. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Recognize and challenge biases: Identify and address any biases or stereotypes that may exist in the education system, curriculum, or teaching practices.
2. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage respectful dialogue, empathy, and understanding among students of different backgrounds.
3. Provide equal resources: Ensure that all students have access to the same educational resources, including textbooks, technology, and extracurricular activities.
4. Support student self-advocacy: Teach students how to advocate for themselves and their peers, particularly those from marginalized groups.
5. Encourage diverse perspectives: Incorporate diverse viewpoints and experiences into the curriculum and teaching practices to promote a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of history, culture, and society.
6. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may hinder the educational success of certain groups, such as inadequate funding or lack of access to resources.
7. Celebrate diversity: Promote diversity and inclusivity by celebrating different cultures, traditions, and identities through events, activities, and curriculum.
8. Provide mentorship and support: Offer mentorship and support programs that connect students with successful professionals from diverse backgrounds, providing role models and guidance for their academic and career pursuits.
9. Encourage critical thinking: Teach students to think critically about issues related to identity, power, and privilege, and encourage them to challenge oppressive systems and structures.
10. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage students to embrace challenges, take risks
