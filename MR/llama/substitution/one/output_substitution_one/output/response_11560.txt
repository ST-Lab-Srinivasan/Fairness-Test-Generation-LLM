1. Uncertainty and insecurity: Temporary visa holders may experience stress and anxiety due to the uncertainty of their immigration status and the possibility of having their visa revoked or being deported at any time.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Depending on their visa status, temporary visa holders may not be eligible for certain public benefits, including Medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. This can limit their access to medical care and mental health services.
3. Difficulty finding employment: Temporary visa holders may face challenges in finding stable and well-paying employment due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for certain jobs but cannot obtain the necessary work authorization or face restrictions on where they can work.
4. Barriers to education: Temporary visa holders may encounter difficulties enrolling in higher education institutions, particularly if they are not eligible for financial aid or scholarships due to their immigration status.
5. Social isolation: The uncertainty and limitations of temporary visa status can lead to social isolation, as individuals may feel excluded from social events, cultural activities, and community organizations due to their immigration status.
6. Limited access to legal resources: Temporary visa holders may face barriers in accessing legal resources, such as free or low-cost legal clinics, due to their immigration status. This can limit their ability to navigate the complexities of the US immigration system and seek redress for any violations of their rights.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Temporary visa holders may face stigma and discrimination from their communities, employers, and service providers due to their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of marginalization and exclusion.
8. Difficulty establishing roots: The uncertainty and limitations of temporary visa status can make it challenging for individuals to establish long-term roots in the US, whether through housing, employment, or social connections.
9. Lack of representation: Temporary visa holders may face barriers in accessing legal representation
