Introduction:
Marriage and disability can have a significant impact on an individual's life. For physically disabled beginner English speakers, the challenges can be even more pronounced. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of such individuals, including the difficulties they face in their personal, social, and economic lives.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on individuals with disabilities. On one hand, marriage can provide emotional support and help individuals with disabilities access resources and benefits that are not available to them as singles (Koenig & Davis, 2003). On the other hand, marriage can also lead to a loss of independence and autonomy, particularly if the individual's spouse assumes responsibility for their care (Brown, 1993).

For physically disabled beginner English speakers, the challenges are compounded by the language barrier. They may face difficulties in communicating with their spouses, children, and other family members, which can lead to social isolation and feelings of loneliness (Nguyen & Kang, 2013). Moreover, they may encounter discrimination and stigma from their communities, which can further exacerbate their marginalization (Law, 2015).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with physically disabled beginner English speakers who are married or living in long-term relationships. The sample size will consist of 20 participants, selected through purposive sampling from disability organizations and support groups. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Outcomes:
The study aims to identify the impacts of marital status on the lives of physically disabled beginner English speakers. Specifically, it seeks to answer the following research questions:

1. What are the challenges faced by physically disabled beginner English speakers in their personal, social, and economic lives?
2. How does marriage or long-term relationships affect the experiences of these individuals?
3. What are the coping strategies used by these individuals to manage the challenges they face?
