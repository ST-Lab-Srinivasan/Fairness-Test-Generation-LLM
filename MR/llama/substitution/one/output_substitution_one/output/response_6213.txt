Ensuring the voices of native Chinese speakers, including recent refugees to the US, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and social justice. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Access: Provide language access services, such as interpretation and translation, at community meetings and events. This will enable native Chinese speakers to fully participate in decision-making processes, regardless of their proficiency in English.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training for government officials, community leaders, and other stakeholders. This training can help build understanding and empathy towards the experiences and perspectives of native Chinese speakers, including recent refugees.
3. Community Engagement: Engage with local communities and involve them in decision-making processes. This can be done through mechanisms such as community advisory boards, focus groups, and surveys. By actively engaging with these communities, decision-makers can better understand their needs and priorities.
4. Advocacy: Support organizations that advocate for the rights of native Chinese speakers, including recent refugees. These organizations can provide a platform for voices to be heard and help influence policy decisions.

6. Public Education Campaigns: Launch public education campaigns to raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by native Chinese speakers, including recent refugees. This can help build empathy and understanding towards these communities and promote inclusive decision-making.

Collaboration with Intermediaries: Work with intermediaries, such as community leaders, religious leaders, and cultural organizations, to facilitate communication between decision-makers and native Chinese speakers. These intermediaries can help bridge the gap between different communities and ensure that voices are heard.
