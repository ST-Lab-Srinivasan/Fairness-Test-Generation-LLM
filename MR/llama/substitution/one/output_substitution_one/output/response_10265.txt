Promoting the financial stability of formerly newly single Native recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Financial Literacy and Capacity Building: Provide training and resources on personal finance, budgeting, and money management to help them navigate the complex financial system in the US. This can include workshops, online courses, and one-on-one coaching.

Providing access to basic banking services, mobile money services, or prepaid cards can help them manage their finances more effectively.
3. Employment and Entrepreneurship Support: Encourage and support Native recent immigrants in starting their own businesses or finding employment in their field of expertise. This can involve providing training and resources on entrepreneurship, networking opportunities, and job placement services.
