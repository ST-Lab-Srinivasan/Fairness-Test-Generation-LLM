Creating more inclusive cultural programs for individuals who are experiencing early pregnancy (especially in the first trimester) requires careful consideration and sensitivity towards their needs. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Engage pregnant individuals in the planning and decision-making process for cultural programs. This will help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account, making them feel included and valued.
