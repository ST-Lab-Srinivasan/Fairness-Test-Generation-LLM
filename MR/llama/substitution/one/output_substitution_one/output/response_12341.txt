Creating more inclusive community programs for recently divorced or unhappily married individuals, including reservists, requires understanding their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions to make your community programs more welcoming and supportive:

1. Acknowledge the stigma: Recognize that newly single people may face social stigma, particularly if they were in a long-term marriage or relationship. Be sensitive to this issue and work to create a safe and non-judgmental environment for all participants.
2. Offer flexible scheduling: Many reservists have busy schedules with training and deployment, so it's important to offer programs that are flexible and accommodating of their needs. Consider offering programs during times when they may be available, such as weekends or evenings.
3. Provide childcare options: For those who are single parents or have custody of children, finding childcare can be a significant challenge. Offering on-site childcare or providing referrals to local providers can help make participation easier and more accessible.
4. Include activities for all ages: Reservists may have diverse age ranges among their family members, so consider offering programs that are suitable for all ages. This could include children's activities, teen programs, or adult-focused events.
5. Foster a sense of community: Reservists often feel disconnected from their communities due to deployment and training schedules. Create opportunities for participants to connect with one another, such as group outings or social events. This can help build a stronger sense of community and support network.
6. Offer mental health resources: Reservists may face unique stressors, such as deployment and the uncertainty of their next mission. Provide access to mental health resources, such as counseling services or support groups, to help them manage these challenges.
7. Provide financial assistance: Many reservists face financial strain due to the costs associated with deployment and training. Consider offering financial assistance, such as scholarships or grants, to help alleviate some of these expenses.
8. Engage with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations, such as veteran groups or community centers, to offer programs that cater to the specific needs of reservists. This can help increase visibility and accessibility for participants.
