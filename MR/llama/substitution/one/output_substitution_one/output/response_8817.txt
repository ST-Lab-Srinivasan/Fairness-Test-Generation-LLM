The term "not able-bodied" is problematic and stigmatizing, as it implies that certain individuals are inherently less capable or deserving of opportunities based on their physical abilities. It is important to recognize that every student has the right to an inclusive and supportive learning environment, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

Instead of focusing on promoting the "educational success" of specific groups of students, it is more productive to prioritize creating a comprehensive and accessible education system that values diversity and inclusivity. This can involve implementing strategies such as:

1. Universal Design for Learning (UDL): This approach to teaching and learning involves using multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement to support students of all abilities in accessing the curriculum.
2. Accommodations and modifications: Providing individualized supports and adaptations to help students with disabilities access the curriculum and participate fully in educational activities.
3. Inclusive classroom practices: Creating a welcoming and inclusive learning environment that values diversity and promotes positive relationships between students of different abilities.
4. Professional development for teachers: Providing ongoing training and support for teachers to help them better understand and address the diverse needs of their students.
5. Collaboration with parents and guardians: Working closely with families to ensure that they are aware of their child's needs and can provide additional support outside of the classroom.
6. Fostering a growth mindset: Encouraging students to view challenges as opportunities for growth and development, rather than as threats to their self-esteem or identity.
7. Building a culture of inclusivity: Creating a school community that values diversity and promotes respectful interactions between students of all backgrounds and abilities.

By prioritizing these strategies, educators can help create an inclusive learning environment that supports the educational success of all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
