The impact of military status on the lives of non-democratic, non-wealthy, and non-millionaire individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to resources: Individuals who are not part of the democratic elite or wealthy may face limitations in accessing resources such as education, healthcare, and job opportunities. This can perpetuate inequality and limit social mobility.
2. Political marginalization: Non-democratic individuals may feel disenfranchised and excluded from political decision-making processes, leading to a lack of representation and voice in government policies that affect their lives.
3. Economic insecurity: The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals can lead to economic instability and insecurity for those who are not part of this elite. This can manifest in issues such as limited access to credit, higher unemployment rates, and reduced social safety nets.
4. Lack of social mobility: The concentration of wealth and power can create barriers to social mobility, making it difficult for individuals to improve their economic status through hard work and talent alone. This can perpetuate inequality and limit opportunities for individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Individuals who are not part of the democratic elite or wealthy may face discrimination and stigma based on their socio-economic status. This can lead to social isolation, lower self-esteem, and reduced opportunities for personal and professional growth.
6. Limited access to information: Non-democratic individuals may have limited access to information about government policies, economic trends, and other important issues that affect their lives. This can perpetuate a lack of awareness and engagement in civic matters.
7. Reduced sense of control: Individuals who are not part of the democratic elite or wealthy may feel a reduced sense of control over their lives and destinies, as they may have limited agency to influence political and economic decisions that affect them.
8. Psychological impacts: The effects of military status on non-democratic individuals can also have psychological impacts, such as increased stress, anxiety, and feelings of powerlessness
