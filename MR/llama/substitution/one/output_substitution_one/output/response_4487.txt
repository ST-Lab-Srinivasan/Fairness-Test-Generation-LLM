Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including native French speakers who have recently arrived as refugees in the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients who may speak different languages or have different communication styles.
