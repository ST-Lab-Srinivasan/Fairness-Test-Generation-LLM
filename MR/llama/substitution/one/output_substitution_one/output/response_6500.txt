Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term single, natural-born or recently naturalized citizen individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of these populations. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Acknowledge and recognize their contributions: Long-term singles, natural-born citizens, and recently naturalized individuals often face discrimination and marginalization in society. By recognizing and acknowledging their contributions to the community, we can promote a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
2. Provide access to education and job training: Many long-term singles and recently naturalized individuals may face barriers to employment and career advancement due to a lack of access to education and job training opportunities. Governments can help address this issue by providing funding for vocational training programs, scholarships, and other forms of support.
