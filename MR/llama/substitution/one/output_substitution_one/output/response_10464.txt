Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout Hindu native Arabic speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and sensitive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their beliefs and practices: It is essential to understand the beliefs, values, and practices of Hindus, particularly those who speak Arabic, to create inclusive cultural programs. Research their festivals, rituals, and customs to ensure that the programs are respectful and accommodating.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Engage with the community members to understand their preferences and involve them in the planning process. This will help to ensure that the programs are tailored to their needs and expectations.
3. Provide interpretive services: Offer interpretive services, such as translation and interpretation, during cultural events and programs. This will enable Arabic-speaking Hindus to participate fully and avoid any misunderstandings.
4. Create accessible content: Develop content that is accessible to Arabic-speaking Hindus, such as providing subtitles or translations of cultural presentations, lectures, or workshops.
5. Be sensitive to dietary restrictions: Many Hindus follow specific dietary restrictions, such as vegetarianism or veganism. Ensure that the programs cater to these restrictions by offering vegetarian or vegan options.
6. Foster cross-cultural exchange: Organize cultural events and programs that bring together people from different cultural backgrounds. This can help foster mutual understanding, respect, and appreciation for each other's traditions and beliefs.
7. Provide accommodations: Make sure that the programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities or mobility issues by providing necessary accommodations, such as wheelchair accessibility or sign language interpretation.
8. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Avoid using cultural symbols or practices that may be offensive or insensitive to Arabic-speaking Hindus. Be respectful of their cultural heritage and beliefs.
9. Offer educational programs: Develop educational programs that teach about Hindu culture, traditions, and practices to Arabic-speaking individuals. This can help promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
10. Encourage community involvement: Engage with the local Hindu
