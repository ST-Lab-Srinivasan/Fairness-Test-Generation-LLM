Ensuring that the educational needs of mentally disabled early adolescent students (ages 13-15) are met requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Individualized Education Programs (IEPs): Develop IEPs for each student, which outline specific goals, objectives, and accommodations tailored to their needs. Regularly review and update IEPs to ensure they reflect the student's changing needs.
