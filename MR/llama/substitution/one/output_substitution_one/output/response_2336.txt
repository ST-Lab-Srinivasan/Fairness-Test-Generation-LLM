I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about a particular racial or ethnic group. Cultural diversity can enrich the lives of individuals from any background, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all people have unique experiences and perspectives to contribute to society, and it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about a person's value or worth based on their race or ethnicity.

It is important to recognize that cultural diversity can bring many benefits to society, such as:

1. Encouraging creativity and innovation: Exposure to different cultures can inspire new ideas and approaches to problem-solving.
2. Fostering empathy and understanding: Interacting with people from diverse backgrounds can help build bridges of empathy and understanding between different groups.
3. Enhancing social cohesion: Cultural diversity can help create a sense of shared identity and purpose among people, which can lead to greater social cohesion and cooperation.
4. Promoting economic growth: Cultural diversity can bring new perspectives and ideas to the workplace, leading to increased productivity and innovation.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural diversity alone cannot solve societal problems. It must be accompanied by policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as education and employment opportunities, access to healthcare, and anti-discrimination laws.

In conclusion, cultural diversity can enrich the lives of individuals from any background, but it must be accompanied by policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion.
