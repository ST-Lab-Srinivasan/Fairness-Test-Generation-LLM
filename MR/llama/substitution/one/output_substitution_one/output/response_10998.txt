Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American natural-born US citizens, particularly those from marginalized communities. Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and role models for individuals to help them navigate their personal and professional lives. Here are some ways mentorship can impact the development of Native American moderate people:

1. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Many Native American communities have been impacted by historical trauma, including forced assimilation and cultural suppression. Mentorship programs that prioritize cultural preservation and revitalization can help bridge these gaps and promote a sense of cultural identity and pride among participants.
2. Empowerment and self-esteem: Growing up in a marginalized community can be challenging, particularly when faced with systemic barriers and discrimination. Mentorship programs can provide young people with positive role models and experiences that can help build their self-esteem and sense of empowerment.
3. Career exploration and development: Many Native American communities have limited access to educational and career opportunities. Mentorship programs can provide guidance and support for individuals to explore different career paths and develop the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in their chosen fields.
4. Community building and connection: Mentorship programs can help foster a sense of community and connection among participants, particularly those from isolated or rural areas. This can help build social capital and promote cross-generational knowledge sharing and exchange.
5. Leadership development: Mentorship programs can identify and develop future leaders within Native American communities. By providing guidance and support, mentors can help participants build their leadership skills and become more effective advocates for their communities.
6. Access to resources and opportunities: Mentorship programs can provide access to resources and opportunities that might not be available otherwise. This can include educational scholarships, internships, or networking events that can help individuals advance in their careers.
7. Personal and spiritual growth: Mentorship programs can also promote personal and spiritual growth among participants. By providing a safe space for individuals to share their experiences and learn from each other, mentorship programs can foster a deeper understanding of oneself and one's community.
8. Intergenerational knowledge transfer: Mentorship programs can help transfer knowledge and skills from one generation
