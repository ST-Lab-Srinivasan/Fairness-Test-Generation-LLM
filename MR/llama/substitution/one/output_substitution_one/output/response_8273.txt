Creating more inclusive cultural events for devout Hindu non-conservative individuals requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the individual's beliefs and practices: It is essential to understand the individual's beliefs and practices before organizing any cultural event. This will help you to avoid any actions that may be offensive or hurtful to them. For example, if the individual is a vegetarian, make sure to include vegetarian options in the event's food menu.
2. Involve the community: Encourage the participation of the Hindu community by involving them in the planning and organization of the cultural event. This will help to create a sense of ownership and inclusivity.
3. Provide alternative options: Offer alternative options for individuals who may have different beliefs or practices. For example, if the event includes chanting or singing, provide a quiet space for those who prefer not to participate.
4. Be respectful: Be mindful of cultural and religious sensitivities when organizing the event. Avoid any actions that may be perceived as disrespectful or insensitive. For example, do not use images or symbols that are sacred to other cultures or religions without proper permission or understanding.
5. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the individual's beliefs and practices, as well as the cultural norms and traditions of the Hindu community. This will help you to create a more inclusive and respectful event.
6. Be open-minded: Be willing to listen and learn from the individual and the community. Be open to suggestions and ideas that may enhance the cultural event and make it more inclusive.
7. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and religions. Avoid using language that is offensive or stereotypical.
8. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that the event is accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing Braille materials, sign language interpretation, or other accommodations as needed.
9. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be aware of cultural appropriation and avoid using cultural elements without proper understanding or permission. For example, do not use traditional Hindu clothing or symbols without proper knowledge or consent.
