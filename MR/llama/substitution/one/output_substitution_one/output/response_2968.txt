Creating more inclusive social policies for upper lower middle-income long-term single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the struggles of single individuals: Long-term single individuals often face social isolation, stigma, and discrimination, which can lead to mental health issues, lower self-esteem, and a lack of support networks. By acknowledging these challenges, policymakers can begin to address them through targeted interventions.
2. Foster community engagement: Encourage single individuals to participate in community events, volunteer opportunities, and social activities that promote social interaction and a sense of belonging. This can help combat loneliness and isolation while fostering a sense of purpose and fulfillment.
3. Provide affordable housing options: Many long-term single individuals face difficulties accessing affordable and secure housing, which can exacerbate financial struggles and limit opportunities for social mobility. Policymakers can address this issue by investing in affordable housing initiatives, such as rent control measures, subsidized housing programs, or incentivizing developers to build more affordable units.
4. Offer flexible work arrangements: Single individuals often face challenges balancing work and personal responsibilities due to a lack of support networks or childcare options. Policymakers can promote flexibility in the workplace by providing remote work opportunities, flexible scheduling, or parental leave policies that support working parents.
5. Implement financial assistance programs: Many long-term single individuals struggle with financial insecurity due to limited access to education, job opportunities, and social safety nets. Policymakers can address this issue by implementing targeted financial assistance programs, such as low-interest loans, scholarships, or grants that support educational attainment, career development, or entrepreneurship.
