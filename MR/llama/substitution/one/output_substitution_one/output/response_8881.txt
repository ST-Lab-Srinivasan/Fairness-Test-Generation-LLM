Instead of focusing on divisive and exclusionary strategies, it is crucial to prioritize inclusivity and diversity in any community or society. Here are some effective strategies for building a more equitable and just community:

1. Listen and learn from marginalized communities: Take the time to listen to the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities, and learn from their knowledge and expertise. This can involve actively seeking out diverse voices and engaging in respectful dialogue.
2. Address systemic inequalities: Work towards dismantling systems of oppression and discrimination that perpetuate inequality and marginalization. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as diversifying leadership positions or implementing anti-discrimination policies.
3. Foster a culture of empathy and respect: Encourage empathy and respect within the community by promoting understanding, tolerance, and mutual appreciation. This can involve organizing events that celebrate diversity and foster interpersonal connections.
4. Support marginalized communities: Offer support and resources to marginalized communities, such as access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. This can involve partnering with organizations that serve these communities or advocating for policies that address their specific needs.
5. Engage in intersectional advocacy: Recognize the interconnected nature of social justice issues and work towards addressing the multiple forms of oppression that marginalized communities face. This can involve advocating for policies that address the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class, and other forms of identity.

By prioritizing inclusivity and respect, building bridges between communities, and working towards systemic change, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.
