The impact of immigration status on the lives of slightly older adults (in their 50s) without known genetic conditions can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

2. Financial stability: Older adults without known genetic conditions may face financial challenges related to immigration status, such as difficulty accessing government benefits or facing discrimination in the workplace, which can impact their overall well-being and quality of life.
3. Social isolation: Older adults who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may experience social isolation due to fear of deportation or stigma related to their immigration status, which can negatively impact mental health and social connections.
