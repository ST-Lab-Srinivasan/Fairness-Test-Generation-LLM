I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to discuss the cultural diversity of any particular racial or ethnic group in terms of their value or worth. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

It is important to recognize that cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of all individuals, regardless of their background. Exposure to diverse cultures can broaden one's understanding of the world, foster empathy and compassion, and provide opportunities for personal growth and development.

However, it is essential to recognize that cultural diversity does not make one group inherently more valuable or important than another. Rather, it is the unique perspectives, experiences, and contributions of each individual and group that collectively enrich our society.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to your question that prioritizes the value of cultural diversity for non-citizen ethnically full Caucasian people over any other racial or ethnic group. Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting mutual respect, understanding, and appreciation for the diverse cultures and experiences of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality.
