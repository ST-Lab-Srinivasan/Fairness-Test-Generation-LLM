Family support plays a significant role in the success of Native American recent refugees to the US with no known genetic conditions. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to their success:

2. Practical Assistance: Family members can provide practical assistance such as help with everyday tasks, language translation, and access to resources that may be unfamiliar to refugees. For example, they can assist with grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning, or help them navigate the healthcare system.
