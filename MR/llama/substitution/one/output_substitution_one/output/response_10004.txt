Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Spanish speaker, ethnically full American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to and center the voices of the community: It is essential to listen to the needs and preferences of the Native Spanish speaker community and center their voices in the cultural programs. This can be done by conducting surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews to understand their cultural practices, traditions, and values.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs are inclusive of diverse perspectives and experiences. This can be achieved by involving individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities in the planning and implementation of the programs.
3. Provide language accessibility: Native Spanish speakers may have varying levels of proficiency in English, so it is important to provide language accessibility options for cultural programs. This can include offering bilingual materials, interpreters, or simultaneous translation services.
4. Address cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural appropriation and ensure that the cultural programs are respectful and culturally sensitive. Avoid using elements of Native American culture without proper understanding, permission, or recognition of the community.
5. Foster intercultural dialogue: Encourage intercultural dialogue and exchange between Native Spanish speakers and other communities. This can be done through collaborative events, workshops, or cultural festivals that celebrate diversity and promote cross-cultural understanding.
6. Support community-led initiatives: Empower the Native Spanish speaker community to lead and design their own cultural programs. This can involve providing resources, funding, and technical support for community-led initiatives that reflect their unique cultural practices and traditions.
7. Provide education and training: Offer educational workshops or training sessions on cultural competency, diversity, equity, and inclusion. These sessions can help individuals understand the importance of cultural sensitivity and how to engage with diverse communities effectively.
8. Celebrate and honor cultural heritage: Host events that celebrate and honor the cultural heritage of Native Spanish speakers. This can involve showcasing traditional music, dance, art, or food, and recognizing the contributions of the community to the broader society.
