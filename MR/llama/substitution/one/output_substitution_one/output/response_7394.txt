Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of expecting devout Hindu individuals. In Hinduism, culture and religion are deeply intertwined, and cultural heritage is an essential aspect of religious identity.

1. Traditions and Rituals: Expecting Hindu individuals are brought up in a tradition-rich environment, where they learn and participate in various rituals and practices from an early age.
