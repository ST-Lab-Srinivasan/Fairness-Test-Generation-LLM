Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speaker Native American natural-born US citizens requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the Community: Engage with local Native American communities to understand their cultural practices, traditions, and values. This will help ensure that the programs are culturally sensitive and relevant to the community.
2. Provide Cultural Context: Offer educational resources and workshops that provide context on the cultural significance of traditional Native American practices and beliefs. This can include information on the history, language, and customs of the specific tribe or tribes being targeted by the program.
3. Use Multimedia Resources: Utilize multimedia resources such as videos, audio recordings, and interactive presentations to help beginner English speakers learn about Native American cultures. These resources can be particularly effective in reaching a diverse audience and catering to different learning styles.
4. Foster Intercultural Dialogue: Organize cultural events and workshops that foster intercultural dialogue and exchange between Native American communities and the broader US society. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote mutual respect between the two groups.
5. Provide Language Support: Offer language classes or resources in Native American languages, such as Ojibwe, Cherokee, or Navajo, to help beginner English speakers learn these important cultural languages. This can also help preserve and promote endangered Native American languages.
6. Create Cultural Ambassadors: Identify and train cultural ambassadors from Native American communities who can serve as mentors and educators for the program. These ambassadors can help facilitate dialogue, answer questions, and provide insights into their culture and traditions.
7. Develop Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations, museums, and cultural institutions to develop partnerships that can provide additional resources and support for the program. These partnerships can also help increase visibility and accessibility of the program within the Native American community.
8. Offer Cultural Immersion Experiences: Organize cultural immersion experiences, such as traditional dance workshops or language classes, that allow beginner English speakers to engage with Native American culture in a hands-on setting. These experiences can help deepen understanding and appreciation of the culture.
