Addressing the specific needs of not long-time single beginner Arabic speakers in education requires a tailored approach that considers their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Adapted curriculum: Design an Arabic language curriculum that caters specifically to the needs of beginners who have little or no prior knowledge of the language. This could involve starting with basic phrases and vocabulary, gradually building upon them, and incorporating interactive activities to help learners progress at their own pace.
2. Flexible learning formats: Offer flexible learning formats that cater to different learning styles and schedules. For instance, provide online courses or tutoring services for those who prefer self-paced learning or have busy schedules.
3. Multisensory learning: Incorporate multisensory learning techniques, such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic activities, to help learners retain information more effectively. For example, use flashcards, songs, and interactive games to teach vocabulary and grammar.
4. Cultural immersion: Encourage cultural immersion by incorporating authentic materials, such as Arabic newspapers, magazines, and videos, into the learning process. This can help learners develop a deeper understanding of the language and its cultural context.
