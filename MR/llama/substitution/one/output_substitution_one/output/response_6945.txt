Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, especially during a sensitive time like early pregnancy. This study aims to explore the effects of immigration status on the lives of individuals who are not recently single but are experiencing early pregnancy. We will examine the various challenges and difficulties faced by these individuals and how their immigration status affects their overall well-being.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with 20 participants who are not recently single but are experiencing early pregnancy. Participants will be recruited through community centers and healthcare facilities that serve immigrant populations. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to collect data on the participants' experiences, including their immigration status, access to healthcare, financial stability, social support, and mental health.

Results:
Our findings indicate that individuals with precarious immigration status face significant challenges during early pregnancy. These include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many participants reported difficulty accessing prenatal care due to language barriers, lack of health insurance, or fear of deportation.
2. Financial instability: Pregnant individuals with precarious immigration status often face financial insecurity, which can lead to food insecurity, housing instability, and reduced access to other essential resources.
3. Social isolation: Immigrant women may experience social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or lack of social support networks. This can exacerbate the emotional challenges of pregnancy and parenthood.
4. Mental health concerns: Pregnant individuals with precarious immigration status are at higher risk for anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues due to the stress of their immigration situation.
5. Lack of cultural support: Immigrant women may face barriers in accessing traditional prenatal care and postpartum services due to cultural or language differences. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative consequences for both mother and baby.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the significant impact that immigration status has on the lives of pregnant individuals who are not recently single. Limited
