Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner English speakers, particularly progressive individuals. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence their perspectives and behaviors:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage shapes an individual's sense of identity and belonging. Beginner English speakers may draw upon their cultural heritage to construct their own identity, values, and beliefs.
2. Intersectionality: Progressive individuals may use cultural heritage as a lens to analyze the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class, and other social identities. By examining how these identities intersect and influence each other, they can better understand power dynamics and work towards social justice.
3. Empathy and inclusivity: Cultural heritage can foster empathy and inclusivity by highlighting the diversity of human experiences. Beginner English speakers can learn to appreciate and respect the cultural practices and traditions of others, which is essential for building a more inclusive society.
4. Cultural exchange: Progressive individuals may engage in cultural exchange programs, where they learn about different cultures and share their own. This fosters mutual understanding, respect, and empathy among people from diverse backgrounds.
5. Activism: Beginner English speakers may use cultural heritage as a tool for social activism. By examining the ways in which cultural practices and traditions have been used to marginalize certain groups, they can identify areas where change is needed and work towards creating a more equitable society.
6. Resistance and challenge: Progressive individuals may use cultural heritage to resist and challenge dominant narratives and power structures. By examining the ways in which cultural practices and traditions have been used to maintain the status quo, they can identify opportunities for subversion and resistance.
7. Community building: Cultural heritage can serve as a unifying force for communities of progressive individuals. By sharing their cultural practices and traditions, they can build connections and foster a sense of belonging among members of these communities.
8. Intergenerational learning: Beginner English speakers may learn from their elders about the cultural heritage of their community. This intergenerational learning can help preserve cultural practices and traditions, while also passing on valuable knowledge and wisdom to younger generations.
