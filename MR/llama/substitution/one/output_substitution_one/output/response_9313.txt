4. Practice activities: Engage them in activities that require Chinese language skills, such as cooking classes, cultural events, or even just simple conversations about their daily lives.
5. Technology: Utilize technology to provide them with language learning resources, such as language learning apps, podcasts, and online courses.
6. Cultural immersion: Encourage them to immerse themselves in Chinese culture by attending cultural events, watching Chinese movies or TV shows, and reading Chinese books or articles.
7. Supportive community: Create a supportive community of beginners who are also learning Chinese. This could be an online forum or a meetup group where they can share their experiences and learn from each other.
8. Positive reinforcement: Offer positive reinforcement and encouragement to help them build confidence in their language skills.
9. Access to resources: Provide them with access to resources such as language learning books, CDs, or online resources that can help them improve their Chinese skills.
