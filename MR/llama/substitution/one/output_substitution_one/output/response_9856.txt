This may involve working with government agencies, civil society organizations, or community leaders to address issues related to discrimination, language barriers, or cultural marginalization.
6. Education and Awareness: Educate the wider community about the experiences and challenges faced by NHNS, as well as the importance of cultural diversity and inclusion. This can involve organizing workshops, lectures, or other educational events that promote intercultural understanding and respect.
7. Media Representation: Work with media outlets to ensure accurate and respectful representation of NHNS in news, entertainment, and other media platforms. Positive representation can help challenge stereotypes and promote a more inclusive cultural narrative.
