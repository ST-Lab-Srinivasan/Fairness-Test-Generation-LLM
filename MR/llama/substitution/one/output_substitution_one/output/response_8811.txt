During the third trimester of pregnancy, women may experience various emotional and psychological changes as they prepare for childbirth and parenthood. Here are some ways to support the mental health of married couples during this time:

1. Communication and Support: Encourage open and honest communication between the couple about their feelings, concerns, and expectations. Provide emotional support and reassurance, and listen actively to their needs.
2. Education and Preparation: Offer educational resources and workshops on topics such as childbirth, breastfeeding, and parenting. Help the couple prepare for the challenges of new parenthood by providing practical advice and tips.
3. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Introduce mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga, to help the couple manage stress and anxiety during this time.
4. Social Support Networks: Encourage the couple to connect with other pregnant couples or new parents through social support networks, such as online forums or in-person support groups. This can provide a sense of community and connection during a time when they may feel isolated or overwhelmed.
5. Self-Care: Encourage the couple to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring them joy and relaxation, such as reading, taking walks, or practicing hobbies.
6. Financial Planning: Offer financial planning resources and workshops to help the couple prepare for the financial responsibilities of raising a child. This can include budgeting, saving, and investing.
7. Emotional Check-Ins: Regularly check in with the couple emotionally, asking them how they are feeling and what they need. This can help identify any emerging mental health concerns early on and provide support before they become more severe.
8. Coping Strategies: Teach the couple coping strategies for dealing with the emotional challenges of pregnancy and parenthood, such as problem-solving, positive self-talk, and time management.
9. Postpartum Support: Offer resources and support for the couple during the postpartum period, which can be a challenging time for new parents
