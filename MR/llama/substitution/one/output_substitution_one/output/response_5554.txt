Title: Exploring the Impact of Genetic Conditions on the Lives of Ethnically Full African-American Elderly Female Individuals

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of ethnically full African-American elderly female individuals. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 participants, aged 65 and older, and analyzed the data using thematic analysis. Our findings revealed several themes, including: (1) Emotional and Psychological Impacts, (2) Social Isolation and Stigma, (3) Healthcare Barriers and Discrimination, (4) Financial Hardships, and (5) Loss of Identity and Sense of Self. Our study highlights the need for culturally sensitive healthcare providers and policies that address the unique challenges faced by this population.

Introduction: Genetic conditions can have a profound impact on an individual's quality of life, particularly among ethnic minority groups. However, there is limited research on the experiences of elderly African-American female individuals with genetic conditions. This study aims to explore the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of ethnically full African-American elderly female individuals and identify potential solutions for improving their healthcare experience.

Methods: We recruited participants through community outreach programs and healthcare facilities in urban and rural areas. Inclusion criteria were: (1) age 65 or older, (2) ethnically full African-American descent, and (3) diagnosis of a genetic condition. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by trained researchers and audio recorded. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results: Twenty participants were included in the study, with an average age of 72 years old. The majority of participants (80%) had been diagnosed with a genetic condition since their 40s, and nearly half (45%) reported experiencing social isolation as a result of their condition. Participants also reported facing barriers in accessing healthcare services, including discrimination from healthcare providers (25%) and lack of culturally sensitive care (30%). Financial hardships were also reported by nearly half (45%) of participants, who
