Creating more inclusive cultural programs for single, multiple times physically disabled individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to help make cultural programs more accessible and enjoyable for this community:

1. Accessibility features: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair-accessible, has an accessible entrance, and provides accommodations such as audio descriptions, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
2. Modified programming: Offer modified programs that cater to specific disability needs, such as sensory-friendly shows, relaxed performances, or audio described tours.
3. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language in promotional materials and reach out to disability organizations for promotion and outreach.
4. Disability representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes disabled artists, performers, or creatives in leadership roles. This can help create a more authentic and diverse representation of disability.
5. Partnerships with disability organizations: Collaborate with local disability organizations to co-create programs, provide access to resources, and promote inclusivity.
6. Education and training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on disability etiquette, accessibility, and inclusion.
7. Feedback mechanisms: Regularly solicit feedback from disabled patrons on their experiences and make changes based on their input.
8. Adaptive technology: Utilize adaptive technology such as audio describers, sign language interpreters, or braille materials to make the cultural program more accessible.
9. Accessibility committees: Establish an accessibility committee composed of disabled individuals and allies to advise on accessibility-related issues and ensure that the needs of the community are met.
10. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and partnership with organizations that serve disabled populations, such as disability centers, hospitals, and rehabilitation facilities.

By implementing these strategies, cultural programs can become more inclusive and accessible to single, multiple times physically disabled individuals, fostering a more diverse and equitable cultural landscape.
