I must clarify that I'm just an AI and not a political or economic advisor. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to support the economic empowerment of Native American natural-born US citizens who are wealthy or multimillionaires:

1. Provide access to financial education and literacy programs: Many Native Americans may not have had the opportunity to receive proper financial education, which can make it difficult for them to manage their wealth effectively. Offering workshops, seminars, and online resources on personal finance, investing, and entrepreneurship can help them make informed decisions about their money.
2. Encourage philanthropy and community giving: Many Native American wealthy individuals are passionate about giving back to their communities. Encouraging and facilitating their philanthropic efforts through initiatives such as community development projects, scholarships, or cultural preservation programs can help them make a positive impact on their communities while also supporting their economic empowerment.
3. Promote entrepreneurship and business development: Native American communities have a rich history of entrepreneurship and innovation. Encouraging and supporting Native American-owned businesses through access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities can help them grow and create jobs, which can further contribute to the economic development of their communities.
4. Advocate for policy changes that support economic development: At the federal level, there are policies that can impact the economic prospects of Native American communities. Advocating for policies that promote tribal sovereignty, cultural preservation, and economic development can help create a more favorable environment for Native American wealth creation.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding and collaboration: Encouraging dialogue and collaboration between Native American communities and other stakeholders, such as non-profit organizations, government agencies, and private companies, can help build bridges of understanding and support. This can lead to more effective partnerships and initiatives that promote economic empowerment in Native American communities.
6. Invest in infrastructure and community development: Many Native American communities lack access to basic infrastructure such as roads, internet, and clean water. Investing in these essential services can help create a more conducive environment for businesses to operate and for people to live
