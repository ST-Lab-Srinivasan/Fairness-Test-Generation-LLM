1. Lack of accommodations: Employers may not be aware of the necessary accommodations for employees with unknown genetic conditions, such as flexible work schedules or modifications to the workspace.
2. Limited job opportunities: Without a clear diagnosis or understanding of their condition, immigrants with unknown genetic conditions may face limited job opportunities or be passed over for promotions.

6. Limited access to resources: Depending on the country or region they are living in, immigrants with unknown genetic conditions may have limited access to resources such as medical care, job training programs, or disability support services.
7. Language barriers: If the immigrant does not speak the local language fluently, it can be difficult for them to communicate their needs and limitations to potential employers.
8. Lack of networking opportunities: Without a clear diagnosis or understanding of their condition, immigrants with unknown genetic conditions may have limited opportunities to network and build connections in their field, which can hinder their job prospects.
9. Difficulty finding the right support: Finding the right support and resources for individuals with unknown genetic conditions can be challenging, especially if they are living in a foreign country.
