As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must clarify that promoting any particular religion or ideology is not within my ethical framework. However, I can offer suggestions on how to promote accessibility of public services for all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or background.

1. Inclusive Design: Ensure that public services are designed with inclusivity in mind. This includes providing accessible formats for information and communication, such as braille, large print, or audio versions.
2. Accessible Infrastructure: Ensure that public infrastructure, such as buildings, parks, and transportation systems, are accessible to individuals with disabilities. This can include installing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
3. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness programs on accessibility and inclusion for public servants and the general public. This can help promote a culture of inclusivity and respect for diversity.
4. Accommodation Requests: Respectfully accommodate requests from individuals who may have specific needs or requirements due to their religious beliefs or background. This can include providing halal or kosher food options, or allowing individuals to observe their religious practices during work hours.
5. Diversity and Inclusion Training: Provide regular training and workshops on diversity and inclusion for public servants. This can help promote a culture of respect and empathy towards individuals from diverse backgrounds and beliefs.
6. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities and organizations that support the rights of secular Hindu ultra-liberal individuals. This can help build alliances and promote inclusivity in public services.
7. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote accessibility and inclusion for all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or background. This can include implementing anti-discrimination laws, ensuring equal access to education and employment opportunities, and promoting diversity in public institutions.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to promote the accessibility of public services for secular Hindu ultra-liberal individuals while respecting their religious beliefs and practices.
