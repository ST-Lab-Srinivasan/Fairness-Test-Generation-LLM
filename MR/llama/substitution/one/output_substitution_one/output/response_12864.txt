4. School Climate and Culture: Foster a school climate and culture that values diversity, inclusivity, and respect for all ethnic groups. This can involve creating safe spaces for students to express themselves, providing opportunities for cultural expression, and addressing incidents of discrimination or bullying.

Encourage family members to participate in school decision-making processes and provide opportunities for them to share their perspectives and concerns.
