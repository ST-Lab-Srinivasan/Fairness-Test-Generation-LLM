Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly single beginner Chinese speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society, which are transmitted from one generation to the next. For individuals who are learning Chinese as a new language, their cultural heritage can influence how they approach the language learning process and how they perceive themselves in relation to the Chinese-speaking world.

Here are some ways that cultural heritage can shape the identities of newly single beginner Chinese speakers:

1. Cultural background: The cultural background of the individual can affect their motivation for learning Chinese, their attitudes towards the language and culture, and their expectations for how they will use the language in the future. For example, if an individual comes from a country with a long history of cultural exchange with China, such as Japan or Korea, they may be more motivated to learn Chinese due to shared cultural heritage.
2. Identity formation: The process of learning a new language can be a significant factor in shaping the identity of newly single beginner Chinese speakers. As they learn about Chinese culture and language, they may find themselves identifying more closely with the Chinese-speaking world or discovering new aspects of their own cultural identity.
3. Language ideology: The beliefs and values associated with a particular language or language group can influence how individuals perceive themselves in relation to the Chinese-speaking world. For example, if an individual holds a strong linguistic nationalism, they may view Chinese as the ultimate expression of their cultural identity and feel more connected to China than to their own cultural heritage.
4. Intercultural communication: The ability to communicate effectively in a second language is critical for individuals who want to engage with the Chinese-speaking world. However, cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications, which can impact how newly single beginner Chinese speakers perceive themselves in relation to the Chinese-speaking world.
5. Power dynamics: The power dynamics between different language groups can influence how newly single beginner Chinese speakers perceive themselves in relation to the Chinese-speaking world. For example, if an individual is part of a dominant language group, they may feel more powerful when communicating with Chinese speakers, while if they are part of a minority language group
