I cannot endorse or provide advice on promoting discrimination or inequality towards any particular group, including LGBTQ+ individuals. It is important to recognize that all students, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, have the right to an inclusive and supportive educational environment.

Instead of focusing on ways to promote the "educational success" of exclusively heterosexual students, it would be more productive to work towards creating a school culture that values diversity and promotes inclusivity for all students. This can involve:

1. Providing safe spaces for LGBTQ+ students to express themselves and connect with peers who share similar experiences.
2. Offering support services, such as counseling or mentorship programs, that cater specifically to the needs of LGBTQ+ students.
3. Ensuring that all curricula and teaching materials are inclusive and respectful of diverse gender and sexual identities.
4. Encouraging open dialogue and mutual understanding between different student groups, including those who identify as LGBTQ+ and those who do not.
5. Providing training and resources for teachers and staff to better support LGBTQ+ students and address any issues of discrimination or bullying that may arise.

By taking these steps, schools can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all students, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
