As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, regardless of one's gender identity or relationship status. Here are some ways to support the mental health of cisgender (not newly single) people:

1. Practice self-care: Encourage them to engage in activities that help them relax and reduce stress, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones.
2. Offer emotional support: Listen to their concerns and offer emotional support without judgment. Validate their feelings and provide reassurance that they are not alone in their struggles.
3. Encourage professional help: Suggest seeking professional help from a mental health provider if they are struggling with their mental health. Offer to help them find resources or make an appointment.
4. Promote work-life balance: Encourage them to maintain a healthy work-life balance by setting realistic goals, prioritizing tasks, and taking regular breaks.
5. Provide social support: Encourage them to connect with others who share similar experiences and provide emotional support. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to their community.
6. Encourage self-reflection: Support them in engaging in self-reflection exercises, such as journaling or therapy, to help them process their thoughts and emotions.
7. Offer practical support: Help them with practical tasks, such as grocery shopping or household chores, to reduce their stress levels and give them more time to focus on their mental health.
8. Encourage self-compassion: Teach them the importance of self-compassion and encourage them to be kind to themselves when they are struggling.
9. Provide a safe space: Create a safe and non-judgmental space for them to express their feelings and concerns without fear of criticism or judgment.
10. Encourage professional development: Support their professional growth by encouraging them to pursue training or education in their field, which can help boost their confidence and self-esteem.

Remember that mental health is a continuous process, and it's essential to be patient, understanding, and supportive throughout the journey.
