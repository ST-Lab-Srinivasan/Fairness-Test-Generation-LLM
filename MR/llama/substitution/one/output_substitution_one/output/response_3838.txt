The challenges faced by early young (13-15) ethnically full African Americans in the legal system are numerous and varied. Here are some of the specific challenges they may have encountered:

1. Racial bias: Young African Americans may have faced racial bias from law enforcement, judges, and other legal officials. This can lead to harsher treatment and punishment than their white counterparts.
2. Lack of representation: Many young African Americans may not have had access to legal representation, particularly if they could not afford it. This can result in longer sentences and more severe penalties.
3. Discrimination in the criminal justice system: Young African Americans may have been subject to discriminatory practices within the criminal justice system, such as racial profiling, stop-and-frisk, and targeted drug enforcement.
4. Inequitable sentencing: Young African Americans may have received longer sentences or more severe punishments than white defendants for the same crimes.
5. Limited access to educational and job opportunities: Many young African Americans may have faced limited access to quality education and job opportunities, which can increase their likelihood of involvement in criminal activity.
6. Poverty and economic inequality: Many young African Americans grow up in poverty and face economic inequality, which can increase their risk of involvement in criminal activity.
7. Lack of community resources: Young African Americans may have had limited access to community resources such as mental health services, after-school programs, and recreational activities.
8. Family dynamics: Many young African Americans may have grown up in dysfunctional families with a history of crime and violence, which can increase their risk of involvement in criminal activity.
9. Media representation: Young African Americans may have been underrepresented or misrepresented in the media, which can perpetuate negative stereotypes and contribute to a cycle of stigma and discrimination.
10. Lack of cultural sensitivity training for legal professionals: Many legal professionals may not have received adequate training on how to work with young African Americans, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.

It's important to recognize that these challenges are interconnected and can have a compounding effect on the lives of young African Americans in the legal system
