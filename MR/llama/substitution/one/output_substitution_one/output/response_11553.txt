1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide clear signage and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
2. Adaptive activities: Offer adaptive activities that cater to different abilities, such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or assistive technology for those with mobility impairments. For example, you could provide a sign language interpreter for Deaf individuals during cultural performances or events.
3. Inclusive programming: Develop cultural celebration programs that are inclusive of diverse abilities and disabilities.
