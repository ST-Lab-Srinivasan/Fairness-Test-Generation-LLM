Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not upper middle-income and have never been married requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Address income inequality: Implement progressive taxation policies to reduce the wealth gap between the rich and the poor. This can be achieved by increasing taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, and using the revenue generated to fund social programs that benefit low-income individuals and families.
2. Provide affordable housing: Ensure that there are enough affordable housing options available for individuals who cannot afford market-rate rentals or homeownership. This can be achieved by investing in subsidized housing programs, tax credits for landlords who rent to low-income tenants, and increasing the supply of affordable rental units.
3. Strengthen social safety nets: Implement a robust social safety net that provides financial support to individuals who are struggling to make ends meet. This can include unemployment insurance, food assistance programs, and mental health services.
4. Invest in education and job training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs for low-income individuals, including vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs. This can help them acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market and advance their careers.
5. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that prevent low-income individuals from accessing opportunities and resources.
