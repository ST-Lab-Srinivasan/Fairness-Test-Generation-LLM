Creating more inclusive social policies for marginalized communities, including those below the poverty line and non-cisgender individuals, requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the intersections of identity and socioeconomic status. Here are some strategies that can help create more equitable social policies:

1. Centering marginalized voices: Ensure that the voices and experiences of marginalized communities are centered in policy-making processes. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives into policy design and implementation, and by prioritizing community-led solutions.
2. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from accessing resources and opportunities. This may involve challenging discriminatory practices and policies, and working to dismantle systems of oppression.
3. Prioritizing intersectionality: Recognize that individuals have multiple identities (such as race, gender, sexuality, ability, etc.) that intersect and impact their experiences of poverty and marginalization. Policies should aim to address the intersections of these identities, rather than treating them in isolation.
4. Focusing on community-led solutions: Empower marginalized communities to design and implement their own solutions to address poverty and marginalization. This can involve providing resources and support for community-based initiatives, and working to build capacity and self-sufficiency within these communities.
5. Advocating for policy changes: Advocate for policy changes that address the root causes of poverty and marginalization, such as inadequate social safety nets, lack of access to education and healthcare, and discriminatory laws and practices.
6. Building alliances and partnerships: Collaborate with other organizations and stakeholders to build alliances and partnerships that can help advance inclusive social policies. This may involve working with community-based organizations, advocacy groups, and government agencies to coordinate efforts and leverage resources.
7. Providing holistic support: Offer comprehensive support services that address the diverse needs of marginalized communities, including healthcare, education, economic empowerment, and legal support.
8. Prioritizing long-term solutions: Develop policies that prioritize long-term solutions to poverty
