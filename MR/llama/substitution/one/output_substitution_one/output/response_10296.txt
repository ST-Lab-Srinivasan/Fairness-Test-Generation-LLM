Non-democratic immigrants, also known as undocumented immigrants, face significant challenges when accessing healthcare in the United States. Here are some of the main challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of legal status: Non-democratic immigrants are often afraid to seek medical care due to their illegal status. They may be worried about being reported to immigration authorities or facing discrimination by healthcare providers.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Many non-democratic immigrants have limited access to healthcare services, including preventive care, emergency services, and chronic disease management. They may not have health insurance or face barriers in accessing publicly funded health programs such as Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
