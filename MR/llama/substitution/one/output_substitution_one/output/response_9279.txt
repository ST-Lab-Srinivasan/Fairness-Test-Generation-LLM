I cannot provide information or answer questions that could be used to stereotype or stigmatize any particular group of people, including those who are physically disabled or belong to any political ideology. Every individual is unique and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or beliefs.

It is important to recognize that disability status does not define a person's identity or worth. People with disabilities are not inherently "hardcore democrats" or any other political affiliation. They are individuals with their own agency, experiences, and perspectives, who may hold a wide range of beliefs and values.

It is also important to recognize that people with disabilities face unique challenges and barriers in society, including discrimination, stigma, and exclusion. These barriers can limit their access to opportunities, resources, and social participation, and can have a significant impact on their well-being and quality of life.

Therefore, it is essential to promote inclusive policies and practices that recognize the value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or political beliefs. This includes working to break down barriers and stigmas, and creating an environment that values diversity and promotes equal opportunities for all.
