Creating more inclusive community events for low-income Native Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Language Support: Provide interpreters or bilingual staff at events to assist with communication between attendees and event organizers, especially for those who may not be fluent in the dominant language of the area.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible and has easy parking and transportation options for those with mobility issues. Offer accessible seating and accommodations for attendees with disabilities.
