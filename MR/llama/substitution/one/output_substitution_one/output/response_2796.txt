Creating more inclusive social policies for jobless partnered individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various challenges faced by this group. Here are some potential strategies that governments, employers, and civil society organizations can consider:

1. Increase access to job training and education: Provide job training programs that cater to the needs of partnered individuals who may have had a career break due to caregiving responsibilities. Offer flexible and online courses that can help them acquire new skills and enhance their employability.
2. Encourage flexible work arrangements: Encourage employers to offer flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, part-time work, or job sharing. This can help partnered individuals balance their work and family responsibilities more easily.
3. Provide childcare support: Offer affordable and high-quality childcare services that can help partnered individuals focus on their job search and career development. This can include government-subsidized childcare centers, or partnerships with employers to provide on-site childcare facilities.
4. Address gender bias: Challenge gender stereotypes and biases that may prevent partnered women from pursuing certain careers or advancing in their chosen fields. Encourage employers to adopt gender-sensitive hiring practices and create inclusive work environments.
5. Promote financial inclusion: Provide access to affordable financial services, such as microfinance loans or savings accounts, that can help partnered individuals manage their finances and invest in their future.
6. Support entrepreneurship: Encourage partnered individuals to start their own businesses or side hustles, which can provide them with greater autonomy and financial stability. Offer training programs, mentorship opportunities, and access to funding sources to support entrepreneurs.
7. Advocate for policy change: Advocate for policies that promote work-life balance and protect the rights of partnered individuals in the workplace. This can include paid family leave, flexible work arrangements, and anti-discrimination laws that address caregiving responsibilities.
8. Build community support: Connect partnered individuals with peer support groups or mentorship networks that can provide emotional support, practical advice, and networking opportunities. Enc
