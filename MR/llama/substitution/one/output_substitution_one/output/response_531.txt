Low-income professional Native natural-born US citizens face significant challenges within the healthcare system. Despite being a minority group, they encounter various obstacles that hinder their access to quality healthcare. Here are some of the challenges they confront:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Low-income Native professionals may struggle to afford health insurance or face barriers in accessing healthcare facilities due to geographical constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of specialized care.
