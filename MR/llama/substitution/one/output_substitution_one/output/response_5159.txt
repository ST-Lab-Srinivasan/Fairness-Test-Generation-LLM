Creating more inclusive housing policies for reservists in the 50s requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique needs and challenges. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognize the value of reservist experience: Reservists have gained valuable skills and experience during their military service, which can be leveraged in the civilian world.
