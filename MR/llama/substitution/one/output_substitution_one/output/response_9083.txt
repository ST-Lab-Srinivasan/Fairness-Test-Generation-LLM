Congratulations on your upcoming delivery! As a professional coach, I understand that this can be an exciting yet challenging time for native English speakers who are recently pregnant in their third trimester. Here are some ways to support their professional aspirations during this period:

1. Flexible Work Arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements such as working from home, flexible hours, or job sharing to help them manage their work and childcare responsibilities.
2. Professional Development Opportunities: Provide opportunities for professional development, such as webinars, online courses, or attending conferences, to help them stay up-to-date in their field while taking a break from work.
3. Networking Support: Encourage and support networking within their industry, connecting them with other professionals who may be experiencing similar challenges. This can help them build relationships, share knowledge, and explore new opportunities.
4. Project-Based Work: Offer project-based work that can be completed remotely or on a flexible schedule, allowing them to contribute to the company while taking care of their newborn.
5. Leave Policies: Ensure that your company offers generous leave policies, including paid parental leave, to support new mothers in their transition back to work after childbirth.
6. Support Groups: Organize or participate in support groups for new mothers, providing a platform for them to share experiences, challenges, and solutions. This can help build a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation.
7. Career Coaching: Offer career coaching sessions to help them identify their goals, explore new opportunities, and develop a plan to return to work after maternity leave.
8. Job Shadowing: Allow them to job shadow or observe other professionals in their field to gain insights into the daily responsibilities and challenges of their role.
9. Professional Organizations: Encourage them to join professional organizations related to their industry, which can provide access to resources, networking opportunities, and career development.
10. Mentorship Programs: Set up mentorship programs that pair them with experienced professionals in their field, offering guidance, support, and valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of their role.
