Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and multiply disabled individuals requires thoughtful planning, consideration of accessibility needs, and a willingness to challenge traditional norms and practices. Here are some suggestions to help make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Consult with individuals with disabilities and organizations that represent them to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are considered in the planning process.
2. Provide accessible venues and transportation: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair-accessible, has a ramp or elevator for those who use mobility aids, and offers accessible parking. For outdoor events, consider using flat, well-lit areas with minimal obstacles. Provide transportation options that are accessible to people with disabilities, such as wheelchair-accessible buses or shuttles.
3. Offer accommodations for communication and sensory needs: Provide a quiet room or space for individuals who may need a break from noise and stimulation, and offer sign language interpretation or closed captioning for those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Ensure that the celebration is free from overwhelming sights, sounds, and smells that might be distressing to some individuals.
4. Make activities inclusive: Plan activities that can be enjoyed by people with a variety of abilities. For example, instead of having a dance party, consider having a sensory-friendly play area where individuals can engage in play without feeling overwhelmed. Offer adaptive sports equipment or participatory activities that cater to different abilities.
5. Provide accessible food and drink options: Ensure that the food and drink offerings are accessible to people with a range of dietary needs, including those who have difficulty chewing or swallowing, or those who require gluten-free, vegan, or other specialized options. Offer cups with spouts or straws for individuals who have difficulty drinking from a traditional cup.
6. Train staff and volunteers: Provide training on disability etiquette and how to interact respectfully with individuals with disabilities. This can include learning about the different types of disabilities, their effects, and how to communicate effectively with individuals who may have difficulty expressing themselves
