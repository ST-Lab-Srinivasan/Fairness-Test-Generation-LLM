Mentorship can play a positive role in the development of any individual, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or religion. A mentor can provide guidance, support, and encouragement, helping an individual to navigate challenges and achieve their goals. However, it is important to ensure that any mentorship program is designed with inclusivity and respect for diversity in mind.
