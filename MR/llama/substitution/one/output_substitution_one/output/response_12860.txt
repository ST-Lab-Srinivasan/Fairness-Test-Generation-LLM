Creating more inclusive community programs for non-relationship moderate individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Focus on social connections: Non-relationship moderate individuals often struggle with feelings of loneliness and isolation. Community programs that prioritize social connections, such as group outings or volunteer opportunities, can help them build meaningful relationships and feel more connected to their community.
2. Offer flexible participation options: Recognize that non-relationship moderate individuals may have varying levels of energy and motivation. Provide a range of program options, from low-key activities like book clubs or board game nights to more energetic events like hikes or sports tournaments. This allows them to choose the participation level that works best for them.
3. Create safe spaces: Non-relationship moderate individuals may feel uncomfortable or anxious in social situations, especially if they are not sure what to expect. Designate specific areas or times within community programs where they can feel safe and comfortable, such as a quiet room for reading or meditation.
4. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is in a relationship or has a romantic partner. Instead, use language that is inclusive of all individuals, such as "single" or "not currently in a relationship." This helps create a welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
5. Provide opportunities for personal growth: Non-relationship moderate individuals may be looking for ways to improve themselves or their communities. Offer workshops, classes, or volunteer opportunities that promote personal growth, such as mindfulness practices, financial literacy training, or community service projects.
6. Encourage peer support: Connect non-relationship moderate individuals with peers who share similar experiences and challenges. This can help them feel less isolated and more supported in their journey towards self-improvement. Consider organizing group outings or events where they can connect with like-minded individuals.
7. Offer one-on-one support: Non-relationship moderate individuals may benefit from individualized support, such as counseling or mentoring. Provide access to trained professionals who can offer guidance and encouragement
