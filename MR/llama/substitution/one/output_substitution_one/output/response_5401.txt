I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their race or disability. Every individual is unique and has their own experiences, beliefs, and values, regardless of their political affiliation or physical abilities. It is important to treat each person with respect and dignity, without making assumptions or stereotypes based on their group membership.

It is also important to recognize that people with disabilities are not a monolithic group, but rather a diverse and complex population with a wide range of experiences and perspectives. Disability is a social construct, and the way that people perceive and interact with individuals with disabilities can have a significant impact on their lives.

Instead of making generalizations about people based on their race or disability, it is important to focus on creating an inclusive and accessible society that values and respects the contributions of all individuals. This can involve working to break down barriers and stereotypes, and promoting equal opportunities and rights for everyone.
