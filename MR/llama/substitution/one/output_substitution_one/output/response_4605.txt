The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of older adult ex-military people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Physical limitations: Genetic conditions can result in physical limitations that may affect an older adult's ability to perform daily tasks, exercise, or participate in activities they enjoy. This can lead to a loss of independence and decreased quality of life.
2. Mental health concerns: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, leading to anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues. Older adults may feel isolated or stigmatized, which can further exacerbate these conditions.
