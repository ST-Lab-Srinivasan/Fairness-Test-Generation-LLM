3. Provide appropriate and sensitive care to patients who may have different expectations and preferences based on their cultural background.
4. Recognize and address any disparities in healthcare delivery that may exist for diverse populations.
5. Develop culturally sensitive treatment plans that take into account the unique needs of each patient.
6. Provide education and support to patients and families from diverse backgrounds, helping them understand their conditions and treatments in a culturally appropriate manner.
7. Advocate for policies and practices that promote cultural competence in healthcare delivery.
