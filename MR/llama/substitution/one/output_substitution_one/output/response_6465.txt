Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of immigrant natural-born US citizen individuals. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Access to Basic Rights and Services: Immigrants, regardless of their status, may face challenges in accessing basic rights and services such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. For example, undocumented immigrants may be reluctant to seek medical care or enroll their children in school due to fear of deportation.
2. Discrimination and Stigma: Immigrants may face discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status. They may experience harassment, bullying, and other forms of mistreatment, which can have negative impacts on their mental health and well-being.
3. Family Separation: Immigrant parents who are undocumented or in a mixed-status family may face separation from their US-born children due to deportation or detention. This can cause significant emotional distress and trauma for both the parent and child.
4. Economic Instability: Immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented or have uncertain status, may experience economic instability due to limited access to employment opportunities, healthcare, and other resources. This can lead to poverty, food insecurity, and other negative consequences.
5. Fear of Law Enforcement: Immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented or have uncertain status, may live in constant fear of law enforcement, which can limit their ability to access basic rights and services, as well as their freedom of movement and interaction with the community.
6. Limited Access to Social Services: Immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented or have uncertain status, may have limited access to social services such as food assistance, housing support, and other forms of aid. This can exacerbate existing poverty and inequality.
7. Insecurity about Future: The uncertainty surrounding immigration status can lead to insecurity about the future, including concerns about deportation, family separation, and disruption of daily life. This can have a significant impact on mental health and well-being.
8. Difficulty in Obtaining Identity Documents: Immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented or have uncertain status, may face difficulties
