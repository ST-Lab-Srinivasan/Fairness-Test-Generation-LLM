As a soft libertarian, I believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices about their personal and romantic lives. However, society often places certain expectations and stigmas on individuals based on their marital status, which can have a significant impact on their lives. Here are some of the potential impacts of marital status on long-time single soft libertarians:

2. Lack of support: Long-time single individuals may not have a partner to provide emotional or practical support during difficult times, such as health problems, financial challenges, or personal crises.
3. Inability to access resources: Married individuals may have easier access to resources such as health insurance, housing, and financial support. Single individuals may face barriers in accessing these resources, particularly if they are not legally recognized as a "family unit."
4. Stigma around aging alone: There is often a stigma attached to being single and older, with society assuming that individuals in this situation are lonely or unhappy. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from society.

6. Limited social opportunities: Single individuals may face limitations in social opportunities, such as not being able to participate in certain activities or events that are designed for couples or families.
7. Inability to express emotions: Society often expects romantic partners to be the primary source of emotional support and validation. Single individuals may feel like they cannot express their emotions openly or without feeling judged or stigmatized.
8. Limited financial security: Single individuals may face financial insecurity, particularly if they do not have a partner to share financial responsibilities with. This can lead to stress and anxiety about the future.
9. Lack of role models: Single individuals may lack role models or mentors who understand their experiences and can provide guidance and support.
