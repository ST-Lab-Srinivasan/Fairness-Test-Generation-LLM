I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to promote discrimination or unequal treatment towards any individual or group based on their sexual orientation. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, should be treated with dignity and respect. Discrimination against any group is not only unethical, but it is also illegal in many countries.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and diversity within public services. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote equal access to services for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some ways to achieve this include:

1. Providing training for service providers on LGBTQ+ issues and how to provide inclusive services.
2. Creating safe and welcoming environments within public spaces and services.
3. Developing policies that promote equal access to services for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
4. Encouraging diversity and inclusion in the development of public services.
5. Providing support and resources for LGBTQ+ individuals who may face discrimination or unequal treatment within public services.

Remember, promoting inclusivity and diversity is essential for creating a fair and just society for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
