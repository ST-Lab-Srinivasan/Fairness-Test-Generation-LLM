Beginner Arabic speakers, regardless of their political beliefs, may face challenges in the legal system due to linguistic barriers. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: Arabic is a complex language with many nuances and idioms that can be difficult for non-native speakers to master. Beginner Arabic speakers may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documentation, which could lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

This can make it harder for them to navigate the legal system, especially in situations where they need urgent assistance.
