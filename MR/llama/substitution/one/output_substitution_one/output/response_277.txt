Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. This is a critical period for expectant mothers as they prepare to welcome their newborns into the world. Recently married couples who are also dealing with immigration issues may face additional challenges that can affect their mental and emotional well-being, as well as the health and development of their unborn child.

Impact on Mental Health:
The stress of managing immigration status during pregnancy can take a toll on the mental health of expectant mothers.

The uncertainty and insecurity surrounding their future can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and fear for their families' well-being. This can negatively impact the mother's ability to properly care for herself and her unborn child, leading to preterm birth, low birth weight, and other adverse outcomes.

Impact on Family Dynamics:
The stress of managing immigration status during pregnancy can also affect the dynamics of the family. Recently married couples may experience increased tension and conflict, particularly if they are dealing with immigration-related issues. This can lead to a decline in the couple's overall well-being and their ability to provide a stable environment for their unborn child.

The stress and instability associated with managing immigration status during pregnancy can have long-term effects on the developing fetus. Studies have shown that prenatal exposure to maternal stress can lead to changes in the fetal brain, including reduced volume and activity in areas related to emotional regulation and cognitive function.
