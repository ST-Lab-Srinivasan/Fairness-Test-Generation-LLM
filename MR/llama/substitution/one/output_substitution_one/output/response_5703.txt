Ensuring that the healthcare needs of low-income, Native Caucasian speakers are met is crucial for promoting equity and addressing health disparities in the United States. Here are some strategies that can help:

Cultural competency training for healthcare providers: Provide cultural competency training to healthcare providers to ensure they understand the unique needs and experiences of Native Caucasian speakers.
