I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular racial or ethnic group.

It is also important to recognize that temporary visa holders are not a homogeneous group and may come from a wide range of cultural backgrounds. They may bring with them diverse traditions, beliefs, and practices that can enrich the communities they live in and interact with.

Rather than focusing on racial or ethnic differences, it is important to embrace and celebrate the diversity of cultures and backgrounds that make up our society. By promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange, we can create a more inclusive and harmonious society for everyone.
