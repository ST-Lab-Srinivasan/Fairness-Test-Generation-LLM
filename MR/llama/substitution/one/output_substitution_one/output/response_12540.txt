The impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled beginners in English can vary depending on various factors. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social interaction: Marriage can provide a social support network, which can be beneficial for language learning. A spouse or partner can offer emotional support and encouragement, as well as provide opportunities for social interaction and practice speaking English outside of the classroom.
2. Time commitments: Married individuals may have more responsibilities and time commitments, such as managing a household, caring for children, or working outside the home. This can impact the amount of time available for language learning and practice.
3. Financial stability: Marriage can bring financial stability, which can make it easier to invest in language learning resources such as classes, tutors, or language learning software.
4. Access to resources: Married individuals may have access to more resources for language learning, such as books, audio recordings, and online resources.
5. Emotional support: A spouse or partner can provide emotional support during the learning process, which can be helpful in overcoming challenges and staying motivated.
