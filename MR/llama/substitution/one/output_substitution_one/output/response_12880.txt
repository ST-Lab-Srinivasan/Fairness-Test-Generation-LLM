Title: Exploring the Impacts of Genetic Conditions on Mixed-Caucasian Heritage Post-Transition Early-Transition Male Individuals

Introduction:

The transition from pre- to post-transition has brought about significant changes in society, including advancements in medical technology and increased understanding of genetic conditions. However, the impact of these conditions on individuals with mixed Caucasian heritage is not well understood. This study aims to explore the experiences and challenges faced by early-transition male individuals with mixed Caucasian heritage post-transition.

Many reported experiencing discrimination or lack of knowledge from healthcare providers, leading to delays in care and increased feelings of isolation.
