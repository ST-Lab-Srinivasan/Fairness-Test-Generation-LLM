Creating more inclusive social policies for physically-disabled radical democratic socialist individuals requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach. Here are some recommendations:

1. Listen to the voices of disabled individuals: It is essential to listen to the voices and experiences of disabled individuals, particularly those who identify as radical democratic socialists. This involves creating spaces for dialogue and participation where they can share their perspectives and contribute to policy-making processes.
