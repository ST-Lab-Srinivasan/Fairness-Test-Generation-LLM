I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice on how to discriminate against any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other inherent characteristic. Discrimination and inequality are harmful and go against the principles of respect, dignity, and human rights for all individuals.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity, diversity, and equality in housing and society as a whole. Here are some suggestions:

1. Advocate for policies that protect the rights of immigrant natural-born US citizens and ensure they have access to affordable and adequate housing.
2. Support organizations that provide assistance to marginalized communities, including those based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
3. Educate yourself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by immigrant natural-born US citizens and LGBTQ+ individuals, and work to break down stereotypes and biases.
4. Advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusion in housing and society, such as affordable housing programs, inclusive zoning laws, and anti-discrimination measures.
5. Engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with individuals from diverse backgrounds to better understand their experiences and perspectives.

Remember, everyone deserves a safe and secure place to live, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other inherent characteristic. By working together to promote inclusivity and equality, we can build a more just and equitable society for all.
