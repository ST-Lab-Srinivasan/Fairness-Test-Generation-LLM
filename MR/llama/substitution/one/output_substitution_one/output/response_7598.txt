Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout Hindu recent immigrants to Canada requires an understanding of their beliefs, values, and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with the community: Reach out to local Hindu communities and conduct surveys or focus groups to understand their needs and preferences. This will help identify what types of cultural programs would be most appealing and inclusive.
2. Offer cultural orientation sessions: Provide workshops or sessions that educate newcomers about Canadian culture, customs, and traditions. This can help them navigate everyday situations and feel more comfortable in their new environment.
3. Organize Hindu festivals and events: Host events that celebrate Hindu festivals and traditions, such as Diwali or Holi. This can provide a platform for community members to come together, share their culture, and build connections.
4. Create intercultural dialogue spaces: Facilitate discussions between Hindu immigrants and Canadians to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can help break down barriers and foster inclusivity.
5. Develop age-appropriate programming: Cater cultural programs to different age groups, such as children's events, youth activities, or seniors' gatherings. This can help engage diverse members of the Hindu community in Canada.
6. Provide language support: Offer language classes or interpretation services for those who may not be fluent in English or French. This can ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy cultural programs without language barriers.
7. Showcase Hindu art, music, and dance: Organize exhibitions, concerts, or workshops that highlight the rich cultural heritage of Hindus. This can help introduce newcomers to the beauty and diversity of Hindu arts.
8. Engage with local schools and universities: Collaborate with educational institutions to incorporate Hindu culture and traditions into their curricula. This can help promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation among younger generations.
9. Support community initiatives: Encourage members of the Hindu community to start initiatives that promote their culture, such as language classes, cultural clubs, or volunteer groups. This can foster a sense of belonging and ownership among community members.
