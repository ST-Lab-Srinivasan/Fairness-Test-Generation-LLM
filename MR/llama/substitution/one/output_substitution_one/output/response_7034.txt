I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Cultural heritage is an important aspect of many communities around the world, and it can play a significant role in shaping the identities and practices of individuals and groups. However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not limited to any one group or community, and it is not inherent to any particular race or ethnicity.

Furthermore, it is important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their political beliefs or affiliations. People of all backgrounds and beliefs have the right to participate in and contribute to political discussions and debates, and it is not productive or respectful to make judgments about someone's identity or worth based on their political views.

In short, cultural heritage is an important aspect of many communities around the world, and it can play a significant role in shaping the identities and practices of individuals and groups. However, it is important to approach these discussions with sensitivity and respect for the diversity of cultures and beliefs around the world.
