As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that ethnicity and race should not be factors in determining one's ability to learn or use a language. However, I understand that there may be certain challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically Caucasian in the legal system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Lack of cultural understanding: Chinese culture is rich and complex, and understanding its nuances can be challenging for anyone, let alone those from a different cultural background. Beginner Chinese speakers may struggle to navigate the legal system in China if they do not have a deep understanding of Chinese customs, traditions, and values.
2. Language barrier: While many Chinese people speak English, there are still significant language barriers that can hinder communication between native English speakers and those who are more comfortable speaking Chinese. Beginner Chinese speakers may struggle to understand legal terminology and concepts if they are not fluent in Chinese.
3. Unfamiliarity with the legal system: The legal system in China is different from that of many Western countries, and beginner Chinese speakers may be unfamiliar with its structures, procedures, and customs. This lack of familiarity can lead to confusion and misunderstandings, which can impact their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
4. Stereotyping and bias: Unfortunately, there are still instances of stereotyping and bias towards Caucasian people in China, particularly in the legal system. Beginner Chinese speakers may face discrimination or prejudice, which can impact their ability to access justice.
5. Limited resources: Depending on where they are located, beginner Chinese speakers may have limited access to resources such as language learning materials, legal texts, and interpretation services. This can make it more difficult for them to learn the language and navigate the legal system effectively.

To overcome these challenges, beginner Chinese speakers can take various steps, such as:

1. Immersing themselves in the language and culture through language classes, cultural events, and interactions with native Chinese speakers.
2. Seeking out resources and support from organizations that specialize in helping non-native speakers learn Chinese and navigate the legal system.
3. Building relationships with local lawyers and interpreters who can provide guidance and support throughout the process
