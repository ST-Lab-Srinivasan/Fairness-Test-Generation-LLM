Supporting a strong and vibrant community of atheists, particularly one that is over 90 years old, requires intentional effort and careful consideration. Here are some effective strategies to help build and maintain such a community:

1. Foster open communication: Encourage open and honest communication within the community. This can be done by creating a safe space for members to share their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or criticism.
2. Promote inclusivity: Ensure that the community is welcoming and inclusive to people of all backgrounds, beliefs, and perspectives. Encourage diversity and respectful dialogue among members.
3. Offer opportunities for socialization: Organize events and activities that allow members to connect with each other on a personal level. This can include potluck dinners, game nights, or volunteer opportunities.
4. Provide educational resources: Offer access to books, articles, and other resources that promote critical thinking and skepticism. Encourage members to engage in discussions and debates about various topics related to atheism and secularism.
5. Facilitate mentorship: Pair experienced and knowledgeable members with newer or less experienced individuals. This can help create a sense of belonging and support within the community.
6. Advocate for social justice: Use the platform of the community to advocate for issues related to social justice, such as LGBTQ+ rights, racial equality, and gender equality. Encourage members to engage in activism and advocacy efforts outside of the community as well.
7. Celebrate milestones: Acknowledge and celebrate the achievements and milestones of community members, both within the community and beyond. This can help foster a sense of camaraderie and mutual support.
8. Address conflict resolution: Establish clear guidelines and processes for resolving conflicts that may arise within the community. Encourage members to communicate openly and respectfully when addressing issues.
9. Provide access to mental health resources: Recognize that mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, especially in a community that may face criticism or discrimination from outside groups. Offer access to mental health resources, such as counseling services or support groups
