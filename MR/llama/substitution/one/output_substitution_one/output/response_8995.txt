I must politely point out that the term "Orthodox Hindu" is a bit ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways. In general, Orthodox refers to traditional or conservative beliefs or practices, while Hindu is a broad term that encompasses a diverse range of religious and cultural traditions. It's important to recognize that not all individuals who identify as Hindu are the same, and it's possible that some may have different preferences or requirements for recreational activities.

That being said, here are some general tips on how to create more inclusive recreational activities for people of any sexual orientation or gender identity:

1. Involve the community: Consult with members of the LGBTQ+ community and other stakeholders to ensure that the activities are inclusive and cater to their needs.
2. Offer a variety of options: Provide a range of recreational activities, such as sports, art classes, or cultural events, to cater to different interests and preferences.
3. Make it accessible: Ensure that the activities are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or financial means. This could involve providing accommodations, such as wheelchair accessibility or free or low-cost events.
4. Be respectful: Be mindful of cultural and religious sensitivities when planning activities, and avoid any content that may be offensive or hurtful to any group.
5. Promote inclusivity: Encourage participants to bring their friends and family, and promote the activities through inclusive language and imagery.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and included, and encourage participants to connect with each other and form meaningful relationships.
7. Be adaptable: Be willing to adjust plans based on feedback and changing needs, and continuously work towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming environment.
