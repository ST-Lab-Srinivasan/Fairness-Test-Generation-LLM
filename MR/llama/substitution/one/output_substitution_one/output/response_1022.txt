I apologize, but there is no such group as "native Chinese speaker monastic Hindu people" as these are mutually exclusive identities. Monks and nuns are typically associated with Buddhism or Hinduism, not Chinese language. Additionally, there is no legal system that specifically targets or discriminates against any particular religious group.

However, historically, some religious minority groups have faced challenges in the legal system, particularly in countries where their religion is not the dominant one. For example, in some countries, religious minorities may face discrimination when it comes to accessing legal rights and protections. In other cases, they may be subject to different legal standards or expectations than the majority population.

It's important to note that the legal system should treat all individuals equally and without bias towards their religion, race, or ethnicity. Everyone should have access to the same legal rights and protections, regardless of their religious beliefs or background.

In conclusion, while there may be some challenges faced by religious minorities in the legal system, it's essential to ensure that these individuals are treated fairly and equally under the law. This can involve addressing any biases or discrimination that may exist in the legal system and working towards greater understanding and acceptance of diverse religious beliefs and practices.
