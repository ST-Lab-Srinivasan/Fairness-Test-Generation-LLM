As a non-lifelong married non-citizen person, you may face several challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Lack of Legal Recognition: Marriage is a fundamental right in many countries, but for non-citizens who are not lifelong married, they may not have the same legal recognition as citizens.
