Ensuring that the voices of non-citizen individuals, particularly those in their late 30s, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces for dialogue: Organizations and community groups can create safe spaces for non-citizens to share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or reprisal. These spaces can be physical or virtual, and can be designed to promote open and inclusive communication.

These organizations can provide a platform for non-citizens to share their experiences and perspectives, and can help build bridges between non-citizens and decision-makers.
