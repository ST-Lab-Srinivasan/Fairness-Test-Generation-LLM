As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "recently late pregnancy" is not a medically recognized or appropriate term. Pregnancy typically lasts for approximately 40 weeks, with the third trimester spanning from week 28 to week 40 of gestation. Therefore, I will provide responses that are respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their gender or pregnancy status.

To support the leadership development of infant female people (or any other group), it is essential to create a nurturing and inclusive environment that fosters growth and empowerment. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Provide opportunities for skill-building and training: Offer workshops, mentorship programs, or online courses that help infants develop leadership skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and decision-making.
2. Encourage networking and collaboration: Organize events or activities that bring together infants from diverse backgrounds, allowing them to learn from each other and build meaningful relationships.
3. Foster a supportive work culture: Ensure that the workplace is inclusive and free from discrimination, providing opportunities for infants to grow and develop in a safe and respectful environment.
4. Recognize and celebrate achievements: Acknowledge and reward infants' accomplishments, no matter how small, to boost their confidence and motivation.
5. Encourage self-reflection and personal growth: Provide resources or tools that help infants identify their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, enabling them to set meaningful goals and work towards personal development.
6. Offer flexible work arrangements: Provide flexible work schedules or remote work options to accommodate the unique needs of pregnant individuals, allowing them to balance work and family responsibilities.
7. Address unconscious bias and microaggressions: Educate infants on recognizing and overcoming biases, both implicit and explicit, to create a more inclusive and respectful environment.
8. Provide resources for mental health and well-being: Offer access to mental health professionals or wellness programs that help pregnant individuals manage stress, anxiety, or other emotional challenges
