As a Mandarin beginner English speaker working in the healthcare system, you may face several challenges. Here are some common ones:

1. Communication barriers: Language barriers can hinder effective communication between you and your patients, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses. This can be especially critical in emergency situations when timely communication is crucial.
2. Limited medical terminology: You may struggle to understand complex medical terms and concepts, which can make it challenging to provide adequate care to your patients.

7. Patient mistrust: Some patients may be hesitant to communicate with you due to language barriers, leading to a lack of trust and potential misunderstandings.
