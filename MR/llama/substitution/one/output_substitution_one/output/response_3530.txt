Creating more inclusive cultural events for recently pregnant women, especially those in their third trimester, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions on how to create a more inclusive environment for actively pregnant individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue is easily accessible for pregnant women. Provide wheelchairs or stools for those who may need them, and make sure there are adequate bathroom facilities nearby.
2. Accommodation: Offer accommodations such as comfortable seating, water, and snacks to ensure that pregnant women can comfortably attend the event.
3. Modified programming: Consider offering modified programming that caters specifically to pregnant women. For example, provide prenatal yoga or meditation sessions, or host a discussion panel on topics relevant to pregnant women, such as childbirth preparation or postpartum care.
4. Inclusive marketing: Use language and imagery in your marketing materials that is inclusive of all gender identities and expressions. Avoid using language that assumes a cisgender (non-transgender) gender identity, and use imagery that shows pregnant individuals of all genders.
5. Respectful language: Train event staff and volunteers on how to use respectful language when interacting with pregnant women. Avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity or pronouns based on their appearance.
6. Gender-neutral bathrooms: Ensure that there are gender-neutral bathrooms available at the event, and make sure they are easily accessible.
7. Baby-friendly environment: Create a baby-friendly environment by providing a designated breastfeeding area or a quiet room for nursing mothers. Also, ensure that the event is baby-carrier friendly and has adequate space for strollers.
8. Inclusive programming: Offer programming that caters to pregnant women of all genders, such as discussions on prenatal care, breastfeeding, or postpartum recovery.
9. Representation: Ensure that the event's representation is inclusive of all gender identities and expressions. Use imagery and language that reflects this diversity.
10. Flexibility:
