I cannot endorse or promote any particular political ideology or agenda, including extreme hardcore libertarian secular Hinduism. It is important to recognize that the rights and freedoms of all individuals should be protected under the law, regardless of their beliefs or affiliations.

In a democratic society, there are several ways to ensure that the legal rights of individuals are protected:

1. Respect for individual autonomy: The state should recognize the autonomy of individuals and their right to make choices about their own lives, as long as they do not harm others or infringe on their rights.
2. Protection of individual freedoms: The state should protect the freedoms of individuals, including freedom of speech, religion, assembly, and association.
3. Non-discrimination: The state should not discriminate against individuals based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.
4. Rule of law: The state should operate under a rule of law, which means that all individuals are equal before the law and are subject to the same legal standards and procedures.
5. Access to justice: The state should ensure that individuals have access to fair and impartial justice systems, where they can seek redress for any grievances or injustices they may experience.
6. Protection of minority rights: The state should protect the rights of minority groups and ensure that their interests are represented in the legal system.
7. Promotion of tolerance and mutual respect: The state should promote tolerance and mutual respect among different religious, ethnic, and cultural groups, and take steps to prevent discrimination and violence against these groups.
8. Education and awareness: The state should educate the public about the importance of protecting individual rights and freedoms, and raise awareness about the legal protections available to individuals.

In conclusion, ensuring that the legal rights of extreme hardcore libertarian secular Hindu individuals are protected requires a commitment to democratic values and principles, such as respect for individual autonomy, protection of individual freedoms, non-discrimination, rule of law, access to justice, promotion of tolerance and mutual respect, and education and awareness.
