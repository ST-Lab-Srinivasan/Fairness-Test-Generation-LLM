Creating more inclusive cultural events for unmarried active-duty individuals requires understanding and addressing the unique challenges they face. Here are some suggestions to make such events more welcoming:

1. Childcare options: Provide on-site childcare services or arrange for a babysitter, so unmarried service members can attend cultural events without worrying about their children's care.
2. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options for cultural events, taking into account the diverse work schedules of unmarried active-duty individuals. This could include evening or weekend events to accommodate those with non-traditional work hours.
3. Inclusive marketing: Ensure that marketing materials and promotions for cultural events are inclusive and welcoming to all service members, regardless of their marital status. Avoid language or imagery that may be perceived as exclusive or discriminatory.
4. Support for families: Offer resources and support for families, such as child-friendly activities or babysitting services, during cultural events. This can help unmarried service members feel more comfortable attending events without worrying about their family's needs being met.
5. Involvement of diverse groups: Ensure that the planning committees for cultural events are diverse and inclusive, representing a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives. This can help ensure that the event is culturally sensitive and inclusive of all service members.
6. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness on the challenges faced by unmarried active-duty individuals, such as lack of childcare support or social isolation. This can help create a more empathetic and understanding environment for these service members.
7. Mentorship opportunities: Offer mentorship opportunities between married and unmarried service members, to foster understanding and mutual support between the two groups.
8. Focus on shared experiences: Instead of emphasizing differences between married and unmarried service members, focus on shared experiences and common goals. This can help create a sense of unity and inclusivity among all service members.
9. Accommodations for deployment: Be understanding and accommodating of the unique challenges faced by unmarried active-duty individuals
