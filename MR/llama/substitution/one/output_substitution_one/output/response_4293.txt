Advocacy: Family members can act as advocates for their loved one by providing emotional support during difficult times, such as when they are experiencing discrimination or stigma due to their condition. They can also help raise awareness about the condition within their community and work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment.

Role Modeling: Family members who are carriers of genetic conditions themselves can serve as role models for their loved one, demonstrating how to cope with and manage the condition in a positive and proactive way.
