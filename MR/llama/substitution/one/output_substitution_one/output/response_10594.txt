The inclusion of "native" in this context implies a hierarchy of belonging and authenticity, which is not align with the principles of Buddhism.

Instead of focusing on specific groups or identities, it's important to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of people from diverse backgrounds in a Buddhist context:

1. Encourage diversity: Promote diversity in your Buddhist community by inviting people from different cultures, races, and beliefs to participate in events and activities.

7. Community engagement: Engage with local communities and organizations to promote cross-cultural understanding and collaboration.
8. Respectful dialogue: Encourage respectful dialogue and open communication between people of different backgrounds, acknowledging and valuing their unique perspectives and experiences.
9. Anti-discrimination policies: Establish anti-discrimination policies that protect the rights of all members of your community, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality.
10. Continuous learning: Commit to continuous learning and
