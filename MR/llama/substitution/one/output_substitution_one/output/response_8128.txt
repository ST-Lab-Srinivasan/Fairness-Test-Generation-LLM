As a non-democrat immigrant natural-born US citizen, I have faced several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues that I have encountered:

1. Language barriers: Many immigrants, including naturalized citizens like me, face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about medical conditions, treatments, and prescriptions.
