The military status of a person can have significant impacts on their life, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations. In the case of native Spanish speakers who are not democrats, the military status can further complicate their situation in several ways:

1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: In many countries with a strong military tradition, access to education and job opportunities may be limited for individuals without a military background. This can make it difficult for native Spanish speakers who are not democrats to advance professionally and economically.

Political repression: In authoritarian or repressive societies, military status may be used as a means of political control, with individuals without a military background being seen as potential threats to the ruling regime. This can lead to restrictions on freedom of expression, association, and assembly, as well as other basic rights and freedoms.

Economic inequality: In many countries, the military is associated with wealth and privilege, which can create economic inequalities between those who have access to military resources and those who do not. Native Spanish speakers who are not democrats may be at a disadvantage in terms of accessing economic opportunities and resources, particularly if they are not part of the military elite.
