The legal system poses several challenges for infants who have been widowed for a long time, particularly females. Here are some of the common challenges they face:

1. Lack of Legal Representation: Widows often face difficulties in accessing legal representation, especially in rural areas where there may be limited access to lawyers. This can result in a lack of understanding of their rights and interests, making it challenging for them to navigate the legal system.
2. Limited Financial Resources: Widows often struggle with financial instability due to the loss of their spouse's income. This can limit their ability to afford legal services, which can further exacerbate their vulnerability in the legal system.
3. Social Stigma: In many cultures, widows are often subject to social stigma and discrimination, which can make it challenging for them to seek legal redress. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, further complicating their access to justice.
4. Lack of Property Rights: Widows may face challenges in asserting their property rights, particularly if they did not have ownership or control over the property before their husband's death. This can result in a lack of financial security and independence, making it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
5. Limited Access to Information: Widows may have limited access to information about their legal rights and options, particularly if they did not receive adequate legal advice before or after their husband's death. This can lead to a lack of understanding of their entitlements and make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
6. Gender Bias: Widows may face gender bias in the legal system, particularly if they are navigating issues related to inheritance, property rights, or custody of children. This can result in unequal treatment under the law and limit their access to justice.
7. Limited Access to Social Services: Widows may have limited access to social services, such as counseling or financial assistance, which can make it challenging for them to cope with the legal system and its complexities.
8. Lack of Support Network: Widows may lack a support network, particularly if they are living in isolation or have no family or friends available to provide emotional or practical support.
