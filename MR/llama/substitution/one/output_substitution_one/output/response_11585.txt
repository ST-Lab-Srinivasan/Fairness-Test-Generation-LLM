I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including the use of racial or ethnic categories to define a "deeply lower-class" group. Economic empowerment is a fundamental human right, and it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserve equal opportunities to access resources, education, and economic stability.

Instead of focusing on racial or ethnic categories, it is more important to address the systemic issues that contribute to economic inequality, such as inadequate access to education, job training programs, and financial resources. Here are some ways to support the economic empowerment of individuals from all backgrounds:

1. Invest in education: Provide access to quality education, including vocational training and job readiness programs, to help individuals acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market.
2. Job training and placement: Offer job training programs that focus on in-demand skills, such as coding, digital marketing, or healthcare, and provide placement services to connect individuals with job opportunities.
3. Microfinance initiatives: Provide small loans or grants to help individuals start or expand their own businesses, which can lead to greater financial stability and independence.
4. Entrepreneurship support: Offer resources and support to help individuals develop entrepreneurial skills and build successful businesses, which can create economic opportunities for themselves and their communities.
5. Community development programs: Invest in community development programs that provide infrastructure, resources, and support to underprivileged communities, helping to create a more stable and prosperous environment for all individuals.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address systemic inequality and promote economic opportunities for marginalized communities, such as affordable housing, access to healthcare, and fair labor practices.
7. Mentorship and networking: Provide mentorship and networking opportunities to help individuals connect with successful professionals and business leaders, which can lead to new career opportunities and economic growth.
8. Access to financial services: Ensure that individuals have access to affordable and responsible financial services, such as bank accounts, loans, and insurance, which can help them manage their finances and build wealth over time
