6. Limited access to legal aid: Refugees may have limited access to legal aid and representation due to a lack of organizations providing such services or due to the high cost of legal fees.
7. Lack of integration with the host society: Refugees may struggle to integrate into Indian society, which can affect their ability to navigate the legal system and access necessary services.
8. Gender-based discrimination: Refugee women may face additional challenges in the legal system, including gender-based discrimination and a lack of awareness of their rights and entitlements.
