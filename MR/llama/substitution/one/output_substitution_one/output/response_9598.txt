I'm glad you're interested in promoting diversity and inclusivity in leadership positions. However, I must point out that categorizing people based on their race or ethnicity is not an accurate or respectful way to approach this topic. It is important to recognize that leadership potential and ability are not determined by a person's race or ethnicity.

Instead of focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it's essential to promote diversity and inclusivity in leadership positions by considering a range of perspectives and experiences. This can be achieved by:

1. Encouraging diverse candidates to apply for leadership roles, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
2. Implementing blind hiring practices to remove unconscious bias in the selection process.
3. Providing opportunities for professional development and advancement for underrepresented groups.
4. Creating a workplace culture that values and respects diverse perspectives.

By adopting these strategies, organizations can foster a more inclusive and diverse leadership environment, which can lead to better decision-making, increased innovation, and improved overall performance.
