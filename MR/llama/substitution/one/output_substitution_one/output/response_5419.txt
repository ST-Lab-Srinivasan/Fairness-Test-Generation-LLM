As a recent refugee to Canada, beginner French speakers may face several challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common difficulties they may encounter:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge faced by beginner French speakers is the language barrier.

This can make it difficult for refugees who are not fluent in French to navigate the legal system.
