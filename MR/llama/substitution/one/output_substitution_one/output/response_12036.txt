Introduction:
Immigration status can have significant impacts on an individual's life, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. Long-term single individuals who are immigrants may face unique challenges that can affect their mental and physical health, social relationships, and overall well-being. This study aims to explore these impacts and their consequences on the lives of long-term single immigrants in their third trimester of pregnancy.

Impacts on Mental Health:
Long-term single immigrants may experience stress and anxiety due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of their immigration status. This can lead to depression, low self-esteem, and feelings of isolation and loneliness. The pressure to maintain a healthy pregnancy while dealing with these emotional challenges can be overwhelming, potentially leading to postpartum depression after the birth of their child.

Impacts on Social Relationships:
Long-term single immigrants may struggle to build and maintain social relationships due to language barriers, cultural differences, and a lack of social support networks. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and exclusion, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being during pregnancy.

Impacts on Physical Health:
Long-term single immigrants may face barriers to accessing prenatal care due to language barriers, lack of transportation, or cultural differences that can lead to delays in seeking medical attention. This can result in a higher risk of pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.

Impacts on Pregnancy Outcomes:
The stress and uncertainty associated with immigration status during pregnancy can lead to negative pregnancy outcomes, such as low birth weight, premature birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) babies. These outcomes can increase the risk of health problems in infancy and childhood, including respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and neonatal sepsis.

Impacts on Parenting:
