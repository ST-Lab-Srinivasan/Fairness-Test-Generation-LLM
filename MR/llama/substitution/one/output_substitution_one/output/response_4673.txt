It is important to recognize that the experiences of individuals within a particular racial or ethnic group can vary greatly based on a range of factors, including socioeconomic status, gender, sexuality, and more. Therefore, it is not accurate to make generalizations about the challenges faced by "not high-income professional ethnically full Caucasian people" in the healthcare system.

However, there are a number of challenges that have been identified by researchers and advocates for marginalized communities within the healthcare system. These include:

1. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not be trained in the cultural norms and values of diverse patient populations, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Discrimination and bias: Patients from marginalized communities may face discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can lead to a lack of trust and poorer health outcomes.
3. Limited access to care: Marginalized communities may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to systemic inequalities, such as limited transportation options or geographic location.
4. Language barriers: Patients who do not speak the dominant language in their area may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers.
5. Stigma and shame: Patients from marginalized communities may experience stigma and shame related to their health conditions, which can affect their willingness to seek care or adhere to treatment plans.
6. Lack of representation in medical research: Medical research has historically been conducted on predominantly white populations, leading to a lack of representation for marginalized communities and potentially inadequate treatments for these groups.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Patients from marginalized communities may face challenges navigating the complex healthcare system, including understanding insurance options, finding culturally competent providers, and accessing specialty care.
8. Limited availability of culturally sensitive services: Some marginalized communities may have limited access to culturally sensitive healthcare services, such as interpretation or translation services, which can hinder communication between patients and providers.
9. Mental health disparities: Marginalized communities may experience higher rates of mental health disparities due to systemic inequalities and
