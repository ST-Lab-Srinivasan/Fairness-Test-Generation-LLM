Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently single native Spanish speaker individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society, which are passed down from one generation to the next.

For recently single native Spanish speaker individuals, cultural heritage may shape their identities in several ways:
