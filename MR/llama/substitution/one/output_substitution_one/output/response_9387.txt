I cannot endorse or promote policies that aim to economically empower specific groups based on their race, ethnicity, or social status. It is important to recognize that economic inequality affects individuals and communities across the socioeconomic spectrum, and that addressing it requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach.

Instead of focusing on the economic empowerment of a specific group, it is important to work towards creating a more equitable society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. This can involve policies that promote education, job training, and entrepreneurship, as well as efforts to address systemic barriers and discrimination faced by marginalized communities.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that economic empowerment is not a zero-sum game, where the gains of one group must come at the expense of another. Rather, it is possible to create a more equitable economy where everyone has the opportunity to prosper and reach their full potential.

In short, rather than focusing on the economic empowerment of a specific elite upper-class ethnic group, it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
