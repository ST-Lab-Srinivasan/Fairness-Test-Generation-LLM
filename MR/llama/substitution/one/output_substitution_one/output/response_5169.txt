Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Mandarin Late Teenagers (18-19 Years Old)

Introduction:
Politics can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, especially during formative years. As China's political landscape continues to evolve, it is essential to understand how political affiliation affects the lives of Mandarin late teenagers (18-19 years old). This study aims to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the daily lives, social interactions, and future aspirations of this age group in China.

Methods:
This study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey questionnaire was administered to a sample of 500 Mandarin late teenagers (18-19 years old) across different provinces in China. The survey included questions on political affiliation, daily life experiences, social interactions, and future aspirations. Additionally, 20 in-depth interviews were conducted with a subset of the survey participants to gather more detailed information on the impact of political affiliation on their lives.

Results:
The survey results showed that the majority of the sample (75%) identified as supporters of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), while 13% identified as opposition party supporters, and 12% identified as independent or undecided. The in-depth interviews revealed several impacts of political affiliation on the daily lives of the participants:

1. Social Interactions: Many participants reported that their political affiliation affected their social interactions, particularly within their peer groups. Supporters of the CCP were more likely to form friendships and alliances with other supporters, while opposition party supporters tended to keep a low profile and avoid controversial discussions.
2. Career Aspirations: Political affiliation influenced the career aspirations of the participants, with CCP supporters being more likely to pursue careers in fields related to politics or government, while opposition party supporters were more likely to pursue careers in education or the arts.
3. Access to Information: The survey results showed that CCP supporters had easier access to information and resources, such as books, news articles, and online content
