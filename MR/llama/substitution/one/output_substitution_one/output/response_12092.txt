As a responsible AI language model, I am pleased to provide you with some suggestions on how to support the social inclusion of advanced individuals aged over 90 years old (and above) who are Canadian citizens. Here are some ways to promote their well-being and inclusivity in society:

1. Age-Friendly Community Initiatives: Encourage your local government to adopt age-friendly community initiatives that prioritize the needs of older adults. This can include modifying public spaces, transportation systems, and buildings to make them more accessible and easier to navigate for seniors.
2. Intergenerational Programs: Organize intergenerational programs that bring together older adults and younger generations. This can help bridge the gap between different age groups and foster understanding, empathy, and mutual respect. Examples of such programs include mentorship initiatives, cultural exchange events, or community service projects.
3. Technology Training: Provide technology training sessions specifically tailored for older adults. This can help them stay connected with loved ones, access essential services, and maintain their independence in a rapidly changing digital world.
4. Health and Wellness Programs: Develop age-appropriate fitness programs and health workshops that cater to the unique needs of older adults. This can include exercise classes, nutrition counseling, and mental health support groups.
5. Social Connectivity: Create opportunities for older adults to connect with each other and the broader community through social events, volunteer work, or community service projects. This can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation, which are common among seniors.
6. Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity for older adults and advocate for their rights and interests in society. This can involve collaborating with organizations that represent seniors' needs and promoting age-friendly policies at various levels of government.
7. Accessible Housing: Advocate for accessible and affordable housing options that cater to the unique needs of older adults. This can include modifying existing homes or developing new housing projects that prioritize accessibility, safety, and comfort.
8. Transportation Support: Provide transportation services or support that are tailored to the needs of older adults.
