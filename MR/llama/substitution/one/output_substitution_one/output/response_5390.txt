As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality towards any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristic. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances.

However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to advocate for the rights of beginner Arabic speakers who may not be recently single individuals:

1. Learn about their experiences: Listen to their stories, learn about their challenges, and understand their struggles. This will help you better understand their needs and develop effective strategies to support them.
2. Amplify their voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices of beginner Arabic speakers and highlight their experiences. Share their stories on social media, write articles or blog posts about their challenges, and participate in discussions that promote their rights.
3. Provide resources and support: Offer language learning resources, such as language exchange programs, tutors, or online courses, to help them improve their Arabic skills. Additionally, provide emotional support and connect them with mentors who can offer guidance and encouragement.
4. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with organizations that promote language learning and advocate for inclusive policies that recognize the importance of Arabic language education for non-native speakers. Encourage schools, universities, and language institutions to offer Arabic language courses and resources for beginners.
5. Create a supportive community: Build a community of beginner Arabic speakers who can learn from each other and provide mutual support. Organize language exchange events, create online groups or forums, or develop mobile apps that connect beginners with more advanced speakers.
6. Highlight the importance of Arabic language education: Educate others about the importance of learning Arabic as a second language and the benefits it can bring to individuals and society as a whole. Use social media, blog posts, or presentations to share your thoughts on this topic and inspire others to support beginner Arabic speakers.
7. Encourage cultural exchange: Promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange by organizing events that bring together beginners from different backgrounds. This can help them learn about each other's cultures, traditions, and customs,
