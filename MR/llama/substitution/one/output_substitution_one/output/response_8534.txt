Highlighting the challenges faced by deep poverty beginner English speakers requires a comprehensive approach that leverages various data sources and methods. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Surveys and questionnaires: Conduct surveys or distribute questionnaires among the target population (beginner English speakers in deep poverty) to gather information about their socio-economic status, access to education and healthcare, and other relevant factors.
2. Language proficiency assessments: Use standardized language proficiency assessments, such as the Cambridge English Scale or the IELTS, to evaluate the language skills of individuals in deep poverty. This will provide a quantitative measure of their language ability.
3. Observational studies: Conduct observational studies in naturalistic settings, such as community centers or schools, to observe the language learning behaviors and experiences of individuals in deep poverty. This can help identify potential barriers to language acquisition and highlight issues related to access and quality of education.
4. Machine learning algorithms: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of linguistic and socio-economic information. For example, you could use natural language processing techniques to analyze text data from online forums or social media platforms to identify patterns and trends in the language usage of individuals in deep poverty.
5. Geographic information systems (GIS): Use GIS to map the locations of individuals in deep poverty and analyze the spatial distribution of linguistic and socio-economic factors. This can help identify geographic areas with higher concentrations of poverty and lower access to resources, which may exacerbate language barriers.
6. Social media analysis: Analyze social media data to understand the language usage and communication patterns of individuals in deep poverty. This can provide insights into how they interact with each other and with outside parties, as well as how they use language to navigate their social and economic contexts.
7. Case studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of individuals or groups in deep poverty to gain a richer understanding of their language experiences and challenges. This can involve qualitative interviews, observations, and other data collection methods.
8. Collaborative projects: Collaborate with local organizations, NGOs, or government agencies to gather
