To ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born US citizens seeking employment are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Expand Medicaid eligibility: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for low-income individuals is the lack of affordable insurance options. Expanding Medicaid eligibility to cover more people could help ensure that everyone has access to basic healthcare services, regardless of their income level.
2. Implement a public option: A public option for health insurance could provide an affordable alternative to private insurance companies, which often have limited coverage and high premiums. This could help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare, regardless of their ability to pay.
3. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers are a vital source of primary care for many low-income individuals and families. Increasing funding for these centers could help ensure that more people have access to affordable, high-quality healthcare.
4. Provide incentives for employers to offer health insurance: Many employers do not offer health insurance to their employees, which can make it difficult for low-income workers to afford coverage. Providing incentives, such as tax credits or other forms of support, could encourage more employers to offer health insurance to their employees.
5. Improve data sharing and coordination: Better data sharing and coordination between healthcare providers, insurers, and government agencies could help ensure that individuals have access to the care they need, when they need it. This could involve implementing electronic health records and other technologies to improve communication and coordination across different healthcare settings.
6. Increase funding for mental health services: Mental health is an important aspect of overall health, but it often receives less attention and resources than physical health. Increasing funding for mental health services could help ensure that more people have access to the care they need to manage their mental health.
7. Provide financial assistance for healthcare costs: Many low-income individuals struggle to pay for healthcare costs, such as premiums, copays, and deductibles. Providing financial assistance, such as tax credits or subsidies, could help make healthcare more affordable for these individuals.
