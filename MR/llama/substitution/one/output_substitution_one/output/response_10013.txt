Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native French speakers and recent refugees to the US requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for staff and volunteers to help them understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the refugee population. This can include information on the cultural norms, values, and practices of different countries and communities.
2. Language support: Offer language classes or interpretation services to ensure that everyone has access to cultural programs regardless of their language proficiency. This can include simultaneous translation during events, language classes before or after events, or hiring interpreters for specific events.
3. Accessibility features: Ensure that the cultural program venue is accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities. This can include wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
4. Cultural adaptations: Be mindful of cultural differences when designing programs. For example, some cultures may have different norms around physical touch or interaction. Be sensitive to these differences and adapt your programs accordingly.
5. Community involvement: Involve the refugee community in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. This can include consulting with them on program content, recruiting volunteers from the community, and involving them in decision-making processes.
6. Cultural orientation: Provide cultural orientation for recent refugees to help them understand the cultural norms and practices of their new host country. This can include information on social etiquette, communication styles, and local customs.

8. Collaboration with other organizations: Partner with other organizations that serve the refugee population to reach a broader audience and provide more comprehensive services.
9. Flexibility: Be flexible in your programming and adapt to changing needs and preferences within the refugee community. This can help ensure that programs are relevant and engaging for participants.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate and solicit feedback from program participants to identify areas of improvement and make necessary adjustments.
