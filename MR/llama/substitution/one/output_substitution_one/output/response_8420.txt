Promoting the educational success of refugee students in the United States can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that educators, policymakers, and community organizations can use to support these students. Here are some ways to promote their educational success:

1. Provide cultural orientation programs: Refugees often face significant cultural barriers when transitioning to a new country. Offering cultural orientation programs can help them understand the academic culture and expectations of US schools, as well as provide information on the legal system, healthcare, and other important aspects of life in the US.
2. Offer language support: Many refugees may have limited English proficiency, which can hinder their ability to succeed academically. Providing language support services, such as English as a Second Language (ESL) classes or bilingual education programs, can help them improve their language skills and better understand academic content.

This can involve promoting diversity and cultural understanding, providing translation services, and offering social support programs.
