Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of physically disabled Mexican people. In Mexico, there are several political parties that represent different ideologies and agendas, and these parties' policies can affect the rights and well-being of people with disabilities. Here are some ways in which political affiliation can impact the lives of physically disabled Mexican people:

1. Access to healthcare: The political affiliation of the government can influence the availability and quality of healthcare services for people with disabilities. For example, if a party is known for its pro-disability policies, they may prioritize funding for disability healthcare services, including rehabilitation therapies, medical equipment, and prescription medication. On the other hand, if a party is less supportive of disability rights, they may cut funding for these services or fail to provide adequate support.
2. Education: The political affiliation of the government can also impact the quality of education available to physically disabled students. For example, if a party prioritizes inclusive education and provides resources for schools to accommodate students with disabilities, physically disabled students may have greater access to educational opportunities. Conversely, if a party is less supportive of disability rights, they may fail to provide adequate resources or accommodations for physically disabled students.
3. Employment: The political affiliation of the government can impact the employment opportunities available to physically disabled people. For example, if a party promotes inclusive hiring practices and provides support for employees with disabilities, physically disabled people may have greater access to job opportunities. On the other hand, if a party is less supportive of disability rights, they may fail to provide adequate support for physically disabled workers or discriminate against them in the workplace.
4. Social stigma: The political affiliation of the government can also impact the social stigma surrounding disability in Mexico. For example, if a party promotes inclusive attitudes and challenges ableism, physically disabled people may experience less social stigma and more acceptance from their communities. On the other hand, if a party perpetuates harmful stereotypes or fails to challenge ableism, physically disabled people may face discrimination and marginalization.
