Creating more inclusive social policies for upper-upper middle-income long-term recently single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the changing nature of relationships: Recognize that long-term singles may not fit into traditional marriage or family structures, and that this is okay. Embrace the diversity of family forms and acknowledge the various ways people build meaningful lives.
2. Provide support for financial stability: Upper-upper middle-income singles may face unique financial challenges due to their income level and lack of access to benefits such as health insurance or retirement plans through a spouse. Governments can provide subsidies, tax incentives, or other forms of financial support to help them achieve financial stability.
3. Promote affordable housing options: As singles may not have access to shared accommodation through marriage or partnership, governments can invest in affordable housing programs or incentivize developers to build more affordable housing options. This can help reduce housing costs and increase access to affordable housing.
4. Offer education and career development opportunities: Single individuals may face additional challenges in advancing their careers due to a lack of access to professional networks or resources through a spouse. Governments can provide funding for professional development programs, mentorship initiatives, or vocational training to help them build their skills and advance in their careers.
5. Encourage community engagement: Single individuals may feel isolated or disconnected from their communities due to their social status. Governments can encourage community engagement by providing grants for volunteer work, supporting community-based initiatives, or promoting intergenerational connections through mentorship programs.
6. Address ageism and discrimination: Single individuals may face discrimination based on their marital status, particularly in older age groups. Governments can implement anti-discrimination policies and laws to protect singles from ageism and other forms of discrimination.
7. Provide access to healthcare and social services: Single individuals may face unique challenges in accessing healthcare and social services due to their marital status. Governments can provide subsidies or other forms of financial support to help them access these services, particularly those related to mental health, chronic illness management,
