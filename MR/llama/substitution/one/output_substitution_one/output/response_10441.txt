Creating more inclusive social policies for physically disabled Marxist individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the intersecting forms of oppression they face. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Disability justice framework: Ground your policy-making in a disability justice framework, which recognizes that disability is not a personal problem but rather a societal one. This approach emphasizes the need to challenge ableism and address the systemic barriers that prevent disabled individuals from fully participating in society.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in policy documents and communication to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and stigmatization of disability. Avoid using terms like "handicapped" or "disabled person," which can be dehumanizing, and instead use terms like "person with a disability" or "disability community."
3. Accessibility measures: Ensure that all policies and programs are accessible to physically disabled individuals by implementing accessibility measures such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
4. Representation and participation: Ensure that physically disabled individuals are represented in decision-making processes and have a voice in shaping policies that affect them. Provide opportunities for them to participate in policy-making through mechanisms such as disability advisory committees or disability rights organizations.
5. Addressing intersectionality: Recognize that physically disabled individuals may face intersecting forms of oppression, such as racism, sexism, and homophobia. Address these intersections by incorporating an intersectional analysis into policy-making and ensuring that policies are responsive to the specific needs of marginalized disabled communities.
6. Inclusive economic policies: Develop economic policies that promote inclusivity and address the unique challenges faced by physically disabled individuals, such as discrimination in the workplace and lack of access to education and job training.
7. Healthcare reform: Advocate for healthcare reforms that prioritize the needs of physically disabled individuals, including access to accessible healthcare facilities and medical equipment, and addressing issues related to ableism in the healthcare system.
8. Social support: Develop social support policies that recognize the importance of community and social connections for physically disabled individuals. Provide resources and support
