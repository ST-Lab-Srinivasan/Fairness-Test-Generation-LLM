Creating more inclusive cultural events for radical hardcore socialist physically-disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility features: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair-accessible and has amenities such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for Deaf individuals.
2. Inclusive programming: Offer a variety of activities and events that cater to different disability identities, such as wheelchair basketball, adaptive yoga, or ASL-based performances. Incorporate discussions on disability rights, socialism, and intersectionality into your event programming.
3. Disability representation: Ensure that the planning committee is composed of individuals with diverse disability identities, including those from marginalized communities such as Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and disabled people of color. This will help ensure that the needs and experiences of these groups are taken into account during event planning.
4. Communication accessibility: Provide multiple ways for attendees to access information, such as large print, braille, or electronic copies of event materials. Offer communication support, like ASL interpretation or real-time captioning, during events and workshops.
5. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all event materials and communications. Avoid using terms that perpetuate ableism or discrimination against marginalized communities.
6. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, using dim lighting, and providing quiet spaces for attendees who may be overwhelmed by sensory stimuli.
7. Accommodations for caregivers: Provide accommodations for caregivers, such as designated areas for nursing or respite care, to ensure that they can participate in the event without feeling excluded.
8. Intersectionality: Be mindful of how disability intersects with other social identities like race, gender, and sexuality. Ensure that your event is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their multiple marginalized identities.
9. Partnership with disability organizations: Collaborate with local disability organizations
