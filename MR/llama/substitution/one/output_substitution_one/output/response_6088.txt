Ensuring that the healthcare needs of marginalized populations, including those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in Mexico, are met is a complex challenge that requires a comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: One of the primary barriers to accessing healthcare in Mexico is the lack of availability and affordability of services, particularly in rural areas. Governments and non-profit organizations can work together to establish clinics and hospitals in underserved communities, provide financial support for low-income families, and offer sliding scale fees based on income.
2. Implement universal healthcare: Mexico's current healthcare system is based on a mixed model that combines public and private providers. While this model has some advantages, it can also lead to disparities in access and quality of care. Implementing a universal healthcare system, where everyone has access to essential healthcare services regardless of their income or social status, can help address these issues.

4. Address cultural barriers: Healthcare providers must be aware of the cultural beliefs and practices of the communities they serve. This includes understanding language barriers, religious restrictions, and other cultural factors that can impact healthcare access and adherence to treatment plans.

Increase funding for public health: Public health initiatives, such as vaccination programs, disease surveillance, and sanitation efforts, are critical for preventing the spread of infectious diseases and promoting overall population health. Governments can increase funding for these programs to help address health disparities in marginalized communities.
6. Promote community-based care: Community-based care involves delivering healthcare services in the context of a patient's daily life, rather than solely re
