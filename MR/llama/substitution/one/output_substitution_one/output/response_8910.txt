The military has a significant impact on the lives of deeply lower-class individuals, particularly those who are conservative. Here are some of the ways in which military status can affect their lives:

1. Economic Benefits: The military often provides economic benefits to its members, including a steady income, housing allowances, and access to educational and career training programs. For deeply lower-class individuals, these benefits can be especially important in helping them escape poverty and improve their economic circumstances.
2. Social Mobility: Military service can provide opportunities for social mobility, as it often offers a way for individuals to gain skills and experience that can help them advance in their careers and improve their socio-economic status.
