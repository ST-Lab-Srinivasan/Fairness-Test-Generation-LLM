Creating more inclusive social policies for employed not lifelong married individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that policymakers and employers can consider:

1. Reform Family-Friendly Policies: Offer flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting, compressed workweeks, or parental leave policies that are gender-neutral and available to all employees, regardless of marital status.
2. Provide Financial Support: Offer financial support, such as a supplemental income benefit or a retirement savings plan, to help employed not lifelong married individuals save for their future and achieve economic security.
3. Address Housing Discrimination: Enact policies that prohibit housing discrimination based on marital status to ensure that all individuals have equal access to affordable and decent housing.
4. Promote Intergenerational Equity: Develop policies that promote intergenerational equity by providing support for education, healthcare, and retirement savings for employed not lifelong married individuals, particularly those who may not have access to these resources through their spouse or family.
5. Challenge Social Norms: Challenge traditional social norms and stereotypes that perpetuate the notion that marriage and children are the ultimate goals of adult life. Encourage a more inclusive understanding of success and fulfillment, which recognizes the value of non-traditional family structures and careers.
6. Provide Access to Healthcare: Ensure that employed not lifelong married individuals have access to affordable and quality healthcare, including reproductive healthcare services, mental health support, and long-term care insurance.
7. Support Childcare and Education: Invest in high-quality childcare and education programs that are affordable and accessible to all families, regardless of marital status. This can help reduce the financial burden on employed not lifelong married individuals who may be shouldering the sole responsibility of caring for children.
8. Address Discrimination in the Workplace: Enact policies that prohibit discrimination based on marital status in the workplace, including hiring, promotion, and benefits. This can help ensure that employed not lifelong married individuals are treated fairly and equitably in the workplace.
