Supporting communities that are just above the poverty line and not disabled can be challenging, as these communities often face unique challenges that make it difficult to access basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. Here are some effective strategies for supporting these communities:

1. Community-based approaches: Support community-based initiatives that promote social and economic development, such as cooperatives, savings groups, and microfinance programs. These approaches can help build resilience and promote financial inclusion among marginalized populations.
2. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity building programs to enhance the skills and knowledge of community members, particularly women and youth. This can include vocational training, entrepreneurship development, and leadership skills training.
3. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address the root causes of poverty and inequality, such as lack of access to education, jobs, and healthcare. Encourage government agencies and other stakeholders to prioritize the needs of marginalized communities in their policies and programs.
4. Health and nutrition support: Provide access to basic health services, including maternal and child healthcare, nutrition education, and disease prevention initiatives. This can help improve the overall health and well-being of community members.
5. Education and literacy programs: Implement programs that promote education and literacy among adults and children, particularly among those who have missed out on formal education. This can help build a more skilled and informed workforce, which can help communities break the cycle of poverty.
6. Livelihoods support: Provide income-generating opportunities for community members through initiatives such as livestock production, small-scale agriculture, and artisanal craft production. This can help build resilience and improve living standards.
7. Disaster risk reduction and management: Support communities in developing disaster risk reduction and management strategies, including early warning systems, evacuation drills, and emergency response plans. This can help mitigate the impact of natural disasters on vulnerable populations.
8. Social protection programs: Implement social protection programs that provide a safety net for community members, particularly those who are most vulnerable to poverty and inequality. Examples include cash transfers, subsidies
