To ensure that the educational needs of very young native Spanish speakers (ages 90 and above) are met, it is important to provide a bilingual and biliterate education that promotes their language development and cultural identity. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Use authentic materials: Incorporate authentic materials from Spanish-speaking cultures into the classroom, such as books, videos, and music. This will help students develop an appreciation for the language and culture.
2. Provide opportunities for oral language development: Young native Spanish speakers need to hear and produce Spanish in order to develop their oral language skills. Provide opportunities for them to engage in conversations and activities that promote language use, such as story time, role-playing, and group discussions.
3. Use visual aids: Young children are visual learners, so using pictures, videos, and other visual aids can help them understand and retain information better. Incorporate these into lessons to support their learning.
4. Encourage peer interaction: Peer interaction is important for language development, as students can learn from each other and practice their skills in a supportive environment. Encourage native Spanish speakers to interact with each other and with other students in the classroom.
5. Provide opportunities for cultural expression: Young native Spanish speakers need to express themselves culturally through music, art, and other forms of creative expression. Provide opportunities for them to do so in a supportive environment.
6. Use technology: Utilize technology to provide additional resources and opportunities for learning, such as online games, videos, and educational apps.
7. Foster positive relationships with teachers: Young native Spanish speakers need to feel comfortable and supported in the classroom. Foster positive relationships with teachers by being responsive to their needs and providing a supportive environment.
8. Provide opportunities for student choice and autonomy: Young children learn best when they have some control over their learning experiences. Provide opportunities for native Spanish speakers to make choices and have autonomy in the classroom, such as choosing topics for projects or activities.
9. Use formative assessments: Formative assessments can help teachers identify areas where native Spanish speakers may need additional support. Use these assessments to guide instruction
