I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race or ethnicity. Education should be inclusive and equitable for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. It is important to recognize that each person has their own unique experiences, needs, and perspectives, and to tailor educational approaches accordingly.

Rather than focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it is more productive to consider how to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment for all students. This can involve implementing culturally responsive teaching practices, providing accommodations and supports for students with diverse needs, and fostering a sense of belonging and respect among all members of the educational community.

In short, rather than making assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their race or ethnicity, it is important to prioritize inclusivity and equity in education for all students.
