Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for partially identifying as male and partly asexual individuals requires understanding and respecting their unique experiences and identities. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Acknowledge and validate identities: Recognize that gender identity and sexuality exist on a spectrum, and that not everyone fits into traditional binary categories. Create safe spaces for individuals to share their identities and experiences without fear of judgment or discrimination.
2. Include diverse representation: Ensure that cultural celebrations reflect the diversity of the community by including images, symbols, and stories that represent a wide range of genders, sexualities, and identities. This can be achieved through visual displays, performances, and other forms of media.
3. Provide gender-neutral spaces: Create designated areas where individuals can feel comfortable expressing themselves without being gendered or sexed. This could include gender-neutral restrooms, dressing rooms, or quiet spaces for those who need it.
4. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume someone's gender identity or sexuality based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask respectful and open-ended questions to gain a better understanding of their identity.
5. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all genders and sexualities. Avoid using binary terms like "guys" or "girls," and instead use terms like "everyone," "folks," or "people."
6. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide gender-neutral options for activities, games, and other celebratory elements to ensure that everyone can participate without feeling uncomfortable or excluded.
7. Engage in intersectional activism: Recognize that cultural celebrations are not just about gender identity but also intersect with other aspects of a person's identity, such as race, class, ability, and more. Engage in activism that addresses these intersections and promotes inclusivity.
8. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by partially identifying as male and partly asexual individuals. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy.
9. Create safe spaces for dialogue: Establish spaces where individuals can have open and honest discussions about their identities
