Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of Native and recent immigrant individuals in the US, particularly those who identify as male. Post-transition and early-transition individuals may face unique challenges related to their genetic makeup, including discrimination, stigma, and limited access to healthcare.

2. Limited Access to Healthcare: Many Native and recent immigrant individuals may encounter barriers when seeking medical attention for genetic conditions, such as language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of access to specialized care. This can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, exacerbating the condition's impact on their quality of life.
3. Financial Burden: Genetic conditions can have a significant financial burden on individuals and their families, particularly those who lack health insurance or face high out-of-pocket costs for medical care.
