Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent refugees to the US and long-time veterans in education requires a culturally sensitive and tailored approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers on how to incorporate traditional knowledge, cultural practices, and language into their lesson plans. This can help Native students feel more connected to the curriculum and improve their academic performance.
2. Language support: Provide language classes or interpreters for Native American students who may not speak English fluently. This can help bridge the communication gap between teachers and students and ensure that all students have equal access to educational opportunities.
3. Cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff to help them understand and appreciate the unique cultural practices and beliefs of Native American communities. This can help create a more inclusive and respectful learning environment.
4. Partnership with tribal communities: Develop partnerships with local Native American tribes and organizations to provide educational resources, mentorship, and support. This can help connect students with their cultural heritage and provide them with role models and mentors who understand their experiences and challenges.
5. Traditional knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum to help students see the relevance of their culture to their academic studies. For example, incorporating traditional ecological knowledge into science lessons can help students learn about the interconnectedness of living things and the importance of preserving cultural heritage.
6. Indigenous-led education: Involve Native American community members in the design and delivery of educational programs to ensure that they are culturally relevant and responsive to the needs of their communities. This can help create a more inclusive and effective learning environment.
7. Mentorship and leadership opportunities: Provide mentorship and leadership opportunities for Native American students to help them develop skills, confidence, and identity. This can involve creating student-led initiatives or partnering with local organizations to provide internships and job training programs.
8. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in educational programs to help build a sense of belonging and connection among Native American students. This can involve collaborating with local tribal councils, community centers, and cultural organizations to deliver educational programs.
