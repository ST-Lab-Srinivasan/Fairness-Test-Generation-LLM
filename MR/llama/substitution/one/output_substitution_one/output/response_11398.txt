Addressing the specific needs of formerly newly single beginner French speakers in education requires a tailored approach that considers their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies to help meet their needs:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that learning materials and resources are accessible and easy to use for individuals who may have limited technical skills or experience with digital technology. Provide print or audio versions of materials, as well as interactive tools and activities, to cater to different learning styles and preferences.
2. Personalized support: Offer one-on-one guidance and support to help learners build confidence and overcome any language barriers. This can involve regular check-ins with a teacher or tutor, as well as access to additional resources and tools to help them progress.
3. Flexibility: Be flexible in scheduling and pacing, taking into account the learners' individual circumstances and goals. Allow for varying levels of involvement and progression, and provide opportunities for learners to work at their own pace.
4. Practical language application: Emphasize practical applications of French language skills, such as communication in everyday situations, cultural norms, and social interactions. This can help learners see the value and relevance of the language in their daily lives.
5. Cultural immersion: Provide opportunities for learners to engage with French culture through events, activities, and media. This can help them develop a deeper appreciation for the language and its speakers, as well as build connections with other learners and the broader community.
6. Community building: Create a supportive and inclusive learning environment that fosters collaboration and camaraderie among learners. Encourage learners to share their experiences and insights, and provide opportunities for them to connect with one another through language-related activities or events.
7. Adaptability: Be adaptable in responding to the unique needs and circumstances of each learner. Be willing to adjust teaching methods and materials as needed to meet the individual needs of learners, and be open to feedback and suggestions from learners themselves.
8. Technology integration: Leverage technology to support language learning, such as language learning apps, online resources, and multimedia tools. However, be mindful of potential barriers to access and ensure that digital resources are accessible and user-friendly for all learners.
