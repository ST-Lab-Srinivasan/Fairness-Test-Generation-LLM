Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-traditional individuals, such as those who are not conservative or lifelong married, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse voices: Include individuals from different backgrounds and experiences in the planning process to ensure that the celebration is representative of diverse perspectives.
2. Be mindful of language and symbols: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or exclusive to certain groups. For example, instead of using terms like "husband" or "wife," use more inclusive language such as "partner" or "significant other."
3. Offer alternative options: Provide options for individuals who may not identify with traditional gender roles or relationship statuses. For example, offer gender-neutral wedding cake options or allow individuals to choose their own partnership status.
4. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration is a safe and welcoming space for all individuals, regardless of their identity or background. This can involve setting clear expectations and guidelines for behavior and providing support for those who may feel uncomfortable or excluded.
5. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by non-traditional individuals, and share that knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy.
6. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adjust plans or traditions as needed to accommodate the needs and preferences of all individuals involved.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of individuals and relationships, and highlight the unique aspects of each individual's identity and experience.
8. Involve technology: Use technology to make cultural celebrations more inclusive, such as using digital invitations or online RSVP systems to make it easier for individuals to participate from anywhere.
9. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities or other needs, such as accessible seating or sign language interpretation.
10. Continuously improve: Regularly evaluate and improve the inclusivity of cultural celebrations based on feedback from participants and stakeholders.
