Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-demonymatic French speakers requires a deliberate effort to address the systemic barriers that prevent these individuals from fully participating in society. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive public spaces:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for public space stakeholders, including urban planners, architects, and policymakers. This training can help them understand the unique needs and experiences of non-demonymatic French speakers and design public spaces that are more inclusive.
2. Inclusive Design Principles: Apply inclusive design principles when creating or renovating public spaces. For example, incorporate braille signage, audio signals for visually impaired individuals, and accessible seating areas for people with disabilities.
3. Accessibility Features: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. This includes features such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
4. Language Support: Provide language support for non-demonymatic French speakers by offering interpretation services during public events or meetings, and providing bilingual signage and communication materials.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with the local community to understand their needs and preferences when designing public spaces. This can involve conducting surveys, focus groups, or participatory planning processes that involve non-demonymatic French speakers.
6. Inclusive Programming: Offer inclusive programming in public spaces, such as cultural events, festivals, or workshops that cater to the diverse needs and interests of non-demonymatic French speakers.
7. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support non-demonymatic French speakers to create more inclusive public spaces. This can involve partnerships with community groups, advocacy organizations, or social service agencies.
8. Education and Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity in public spaces through education campaigns, workshops, or events. This can help to promote a culture of inclusion and respect for diversity.
9. Public Art: Incorporate public art installations that reflect the diversity of non-demonymatic French speakers into public spaces. This can include murals, sculptures
