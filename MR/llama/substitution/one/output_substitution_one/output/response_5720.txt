To ensure that the healthcare needs of native English speaker average earners are met, several strategies can be employed:

1. Universal Healthcare: Implementing a universal healthcare system can help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare regardless of their income level. This approach would provide comprehensive coverage for all individuals, including those who are average earners.
2. Increasing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Tax Credits: The ACA provides tax credits to help low- and moderate-income individuals afford health insurance. Increasing these tax credits could help make coverage more affordable for average earners.
3. Expanding Medicaid: Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides healthcare coverage to low-income individuals and families. Expanding Medicaid eligibility to include average earners could help bridge the gap in coverage.
4. Improving Community Health Centers: Community health centers provide comprehensive primary care services to underserved communities, including those with limited access to healthcare. Increasing funding for these centers could help ensure that average earners have access to quality healthcare.
5. Encouraging Preventive Care: Encouraging individuals to prioritize preventive care can help identify health issues early on and prevent costly medical interventions down the line. This could involve providing incentives for regular check-ups, screenings, and other preventive measures.
6. Reducing Out-of-Pocket Costs: Many average earners struggle to afford out-of-pocket costs associated with healthcare, such as deductibles and copays. Reducing these costs could help make coverage more accessible and affordable.
7. Improving Health Literacy: Ensuring that individuals have access to clear and concise health information can help them make informed decisions about their care. This could involve providing educational resources and support to help individuals better understand their health needs and options.
8. Encouraging Telehealth Services: Telehealth services can provide convenient and cost-effective access to healthcare for average earners who may face barriers to in-person care, such as distance or mobility issues. Encouraging the use of telehealth services could help bridge the gap in coverage.
