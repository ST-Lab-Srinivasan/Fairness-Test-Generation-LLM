Highlighting the issues faced by native English speaker and native Chinese speaker individuals can be a complex task, as it involves understanding the nuances of language proficiency and cultural differences. Here are some ways you can use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Language Proficiency Tests: Administer language proficiency tests to both native English speakers and native Chinese speakers. Analyze the results to identify areas where one group performs better than the other, such as in grammar, vocabulary, or reading comprehension.
2. Survey Responses: Conduct surveys among the two groups to gather information on their language learning experiences, challenges, and motivations. Use statistical analysis to identify patterns and trends that highlight the issues faced by each group.
3. Language Usage Data: Collect data on how each group uses English and Chinese in their daily lives. For example, analyze social media posts or conversation records to see which group uses more idiomatic expressions or colloquialisms.
4. Cultural Comparison: Conduct a cultural comparison study to identify the differences between the two groups' language use patterns. This could involve analyzing data on how each group interacts with others, their communication styles, and their language learning strategies.
5. Language Teaching Methods: Analyze the language teaching methods used for native English speakers and native Chinese speakers. Identify which methods are more effective for each group and why.
6. Bilingual Individuals: Study bilingual individuals who are fluent in both English and Chinese to identify their unique language learning experiences and challenges. This could involve analyzing data on how they switch between languages, their language use patterns, and their cognitive abilities.
7. Sociolinguistic Analysis: Conduct a sociolinguistic analysis of the two groups' language use in different social contexts, such as in formal or informal settings, with friends or strangers, etc. This could help identify how language use varies across different situations and how it reflects the cultural norms and values of each group.
8. Language Learning Apps: Analyze data from language learning apps used by native English speakers and native Chinese speakers. Identify which apps are more popular among each group, and analyze user feedback to identify areas where the apps may be lacking for one or both
