As a small-government advocate and recent refugee to the US, navigating the healthcare system can be particularly challenging. Here are some of the common challenges faced by this group:

1. Language barriers: Many recent refugees may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties in understanding and accessing healthcare services.
2. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of refugee populations, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
