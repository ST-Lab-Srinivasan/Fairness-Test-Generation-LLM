Addressing the specific needs of Native American natural-born US citizens who are long-term, recently single individuals in education requires a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some recommendations:

1. Culturally responsive curriculum: Develop curricula that incorporate Native American history, culture, and perspectives. Include stories, art, music, and other cultural expressions that reflect the diversity of Native American communities.
2. Indigenous language instruction: Provide opportunities for students to learn their native language and culture. This can help preserve their heritage and promote a sense of identity and belonging.
3. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair recently single individuals with experienced educators or community members who can provide guidance and support.
4. Single-parent support groups: Establish support groups specifically for single parents, providing them with a safe space to share experiences, receive emotional support, and access resources.
5. Cultural events and activities: Organize cultural events and activities that celebrate Native American heritage and traditions. This can help foster a sense of community and belonging among students.
6. Partnership with tribal communities: Develop partnerships with local tribal communities to provide educational opportunities, share resources, and collaborate on projects that benefit the broader community.
7. Community outreach and engagement: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to raise awareness about the specific needs of Native American single-parent households and promote educational opportunities for their children.
8. Scholarships and financial aid: Provide scholarships and financial aid specifically for Native American students who are recently single parents, to help them overcome financial barriers to education.
9. On-campus resources: Establish on-campus resources such as childcare services, counseling services, and academic support services that cater to the specific needs of Native American single-parent households.
10. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels to address the systemic barriers that prevent Native American single-parent households from accessing quality education.

By addressing these specific needs, educators and policymakers can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive educational environment for Native American single-parent households.
