2. Inclusive zoning laws: Zoning laws should not discriminate against any particular group, and should allow for a range of housing types and sizes to accommodate different needs and preferences.
3. Fair housing practices: Housing providers and real estate agents should be trained in fair housing practices to ensure that all individuals are treated equally and without discrimination.
4. Accessible design: Housing should be designed with accessibility features that accommodate the needs of individuals with disabilities, including those who identify as LGBTQ+.
5. Community engagement: Building inclusive communities requires actively engaging with and listening to the needs and concerns of all members, including those from marginalized groups.
