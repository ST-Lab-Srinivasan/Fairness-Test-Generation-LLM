Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speaker refugees in the US requires understanding and respecting their unique experiences, backgrounds, and needs. Here are some suggestions to make these programs more welcoming and effective:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of the refugees' cultures and identities.

Be flexible and adaptable in your approach to accommodate these differences.
