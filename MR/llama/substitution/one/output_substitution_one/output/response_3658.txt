Documented non-single, multiple times (DNSMT) individuals face significant challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges arise from the complexities of managing their health information and ensuring seamless care coordination across different providers and settings. Some of the key challenges faced by DNSMT individuals include:

1. Information fragmentation: DNSMT individuals often have multiple health records from various providers, which can lead to information fragmentation and difficulty in accessing complete and up-to-date medical history.
2. Lack of continuity of care: With multiple providers and health records, there is a risk of discontinuity in care, leading to potential gaps in treatment and poor coordination among healthcare professionals.
3. Increased administrative burden: DNSMT individuals may experience an increased administrative burden due to the need to manage multiple health records, which can lead to frustration and burnout.
4. Limited access to care: DNSMT individuals may encounter barriers when accessing healthcare services, particularly if they lack a fixed address or face other social determinants of health challenges.
5. Stigma and discrimination: DNSMT individuals may experience stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, which can impact their mental health and well-being.
6. Difficulty in accessing specialized care: DNSMT individuals may face challenges when trying to access specialized care, such as mental health services or complex medical procedures, due to a lack of knowledge about available resources or difficulty navigating the healthcare system.
7. Limited understanding of their rights: DNSMT individuals may be unaware of their legal rights and responsibilities within the healthcare system, leading to potential injustices or inequalities.
8. Language barriers: For DNSMT individuals who are non-native speakers or have limited proficiency in the dominant language of their location, there may be communication challenges when interacting with healthcare providers.
9. Transportation issues: DNSMT individuals may encounter difficulties when trying to access healthcare services due to a lack of transportation options or mobility limitations.
10. Financial barriers: DNSMT individuals may face financial barriers when trying to access healthcare services, particularly if they lack health insurance or have high out-of-pocket costs.
