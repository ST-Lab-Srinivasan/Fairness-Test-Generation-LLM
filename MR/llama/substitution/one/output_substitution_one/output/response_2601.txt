Title: Challenges Faced by Beginner Chinese Speakers Over 90 Years Old in the Healthcare System

Introduction:
As the global population ages, there is an increasing number of older adults who are learning a second language, including Chinese. However, research has shown that older adults face unique challenges when learning a new language, particularly if they are beginner learners. This paper will explore the challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers over the age of 90 in the healthcare system.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that older adults experience cognitive decline as they age, which can affect their ability to learn a new language (Smith & Wixted, 2018). Additionally, older adults may have limited mobility and dexterity, making it more difficult for them to practice speaking and writing in Chinese (Fisher et al., 2017).

Age-related decline in cognitive abilities can impact beginner Chinese speakers over the age of 90 in various ways. For example, they may struggle with remembering new vocabulary words and grammar rules (Bialystok, 2012). They may also experience difficulty with pronunciation and intonation, which can affect their ability to communicate effectively in Chinese (Lau & Goldstein, 2016).

Moreover, older adults may face challenges in the healthcare system due to language barriers. They may have difficulty understanding medical terminology and instructions given by healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications (Komiske et al., 2017). This can result in adverse events, such as medication errors or missed diagnoses, which can have serious consequences for their health (Barnes & Baeza-Yáñez, 2018).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with beginner Chinese speakers over the age of 90. Participants will be recruited from local community centers and retirement homes. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis will be used to identify themes and patterns in the data.

Significance:
This study aims to provide an understanding of
