The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-able-bodied, non-single individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing medical care, including delayed or foregone care, due to concerns about immigration status and potential deportation. This can lead to worsened health outcomes, especially for people with chronic conditions or disabilities.
