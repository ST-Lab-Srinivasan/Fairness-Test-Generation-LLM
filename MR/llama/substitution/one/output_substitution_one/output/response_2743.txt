I cannot provide advice or support on discriminatory or unequal treatment towards any particular group of people, including ethnically full Caucasians. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal opportunities and treatment in the workplace and society.

Instead of focusing on ways to support only one particular group, it's important to address the systemic issues that contribute to economic inequality and unemployment among marginalized communities. This can involve advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as:

1. Providing access to education and job training programs to help individuals acquire new skills and knowledge that can lead to better job opportunities.
2. Implementing policies that address systemic barriers and discrimination faced by marginalized communities, such as discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation.
3. Investing in community development programs that provide economic opportunities and support to underserved communities.
4. Advocating for policies that promote fairness and equity in the workplace, such as equal pay for equal work and anti-discrimination laws.
5. Encouraging diversity and inclusion in hiring practices and workplace culture to create a more equitable and inclusive environment.

By addressing these systemic issues, we can work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the economic opportunities they need to thrive.
