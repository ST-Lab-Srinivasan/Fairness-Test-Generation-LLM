Creating more inclusive community events for physically-disabled upper-class people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible to people with mobility impairments. Provide wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Offer reserved parking spaces for people with disabilities.
2. Inclusive Programming: Offer a variety of activities that cater to different abilities and interests. For example, provide sign language interpretation or closed captioning for deaf or hard-of-hearing attendees. Offer adaptive sports or recreational activities for people with physical disabilities.
3. Involve Disability Organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to help plan and promote the event. Leverage their expertise and network to reach a wider audience of physically-disabled upper-class people.
4. Education and Training: Provide training for staff, volunteers, and participants on disability etiquette and inclusive practices. This can help create a more welcoming and respectful environment for everyone involved.
5. Communication: Use multiple channels to communicate with attendees, including those with hearing or speech impairments. Provide clear and concise information through visual aids, written materials, and accessible digital content.
6. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as seating areas for people who may need to take breaks or rest during the event. Provide accessible food options, such as pre-cut fruit and cheese plates, for attendees with feeding difficulties.
7. Volunteer Support: Train volunteers to assist attendees with disabilities and provide support as needed. This can include helping with navigation, providing adaptive equipment, or simply being a friendly face and ear to listen.
8. Collaborate with Disability Advocates: Work with disability advocates to ensure that the event is planned and executed in an inclusive manner. They can offer valuable insights and suggestions for making the event more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
9. Flexibility: Be flexible and willing to accommodate special requests or needs of attendees. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone involved.
