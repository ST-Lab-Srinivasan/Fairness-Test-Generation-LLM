Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of single multiple times beginner Arabic speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, beliefs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular cultural or ethnic group.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of single multiple times beginner Arabic speakers:
