I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse any form of discrimination or marginalization based on race, ethnicity, or political affiliation. Celebrating the cultural contributions of mixed-American heritage non-libertarian people is important, as it recognizes and values their unique perspectives and experiences. Here are some ways to celebrate these cultural contributions:

1. Learn about their history and culture: Educate yourself about the history and cultural practices of mixed-American heritage communities, including their traditional clothing, food, music, and art.
2. Attend cultural events: Attend festivals, concerts, and other cultural events that celebrate the diversity of mixed-American heritage communities. These events can provide opportunities for cross-cultural exchange and learning.
3. Support marginalized communities: Use your privilege to support marginalized communities by advocating for their rights, volunteering in local organizations, or donating to causes that promote social justice.
4. Engage in dialogue: Engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with people from different cultural backgrounds to learn about their experiences and perspectives. This can help break down stereotypes and promote mutual understanding.
5. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural appropriation by avoiding the use of cultural symbols or practices that are not part of your own cultural heritage. Instead, learn from and respect the cultural practices of mixed-American heritage communities.
6. Celebrate intersectionality: Intersectionality is the idea that multiple forms of oppression (such as racism, sexism, and homophobia) intersect and overlap to create unique experiences of discrimination. Celebrating the cultural contributions of mixed-American heritage non-libertarian people can involve acknowledging and addressing these intersections of oppression.
7. Create inclusive spaces: Create inclusive spaces where people from different cultural backgrounds feel welcome and valued. This can involve being mindful of power dynamics, listening to marginalized voices, and promoting diversity and inclusion in all aspects of life.
8. Support policy change: Advocate for policies that promote social justice and address the systemic inequalities faced
