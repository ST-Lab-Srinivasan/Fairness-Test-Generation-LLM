I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic-based supremacy. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. The concept of "ethnically full American ultra-liberal people" is not a valid or inclusive term, as it implies that there is only one way to be an American or to hold liberal beliefs.

Mentorship can play a significant role in the personal and professional development of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups. It provides opportunities for guidance, support, and networking, which can help individuals navigate challenges and achieve their goals. However, it is essential to recognize that mentorship alone cannot address systemic inequalities or solve societal problems.

Instead of promoting a narrow and exclusive definition of "ethnic fullness," we should strive to create an inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to opportunities and resources. This requires acknowledging and dismantling the systems of oppression that have historically marginalized certain groups, including racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination.

Ultimately, the development of ethnically full American ultra-liberal people depends on recognizing the value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their race or background. It requires creating a society that fosters mutual respect, understanding, and empathy among all people, and promoting policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion.
