1. Discrimination and bias: Mixed race individuals may experience discrimination and bias within the healthcare system, particularly if they do not "look" or "sound" like a traditional member of their racial group. This can affect their quality of care and create barriers to accessing healthcare services.
2. Microaggressions and stereotyping: Mixed race individuals may experience microaggressions and stereotyping from healthcare providers, which can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and distrust.

4. Lack of representation: Mixed race individuals may feel underrepresented or invisible within the healthcare system, particularly if they do not see themselves represented in leadership positions or in healthcare providers' attire.
5. Difficulty accessing care: Depending on their individual circumstances, mixed race individuals may face challenges accessing healthcare services due to factors such as language barriers, transportation issues, or lack of knowledge about available resources.
6. Stigma and shame: Mixed race individuals may experience stigma and shame related to their racial identity, which can affect their mental and physical health.
7. Lack of understanding: Healthcare providers may not fully understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by mixed race individuals, which can result in a lack of empathy or understanding when providing care.
8. Limited resources: Depending on where they live, mixed race individuals may have limited access to healthcare resources such as specialists, medical equipment, or prescription medication.
9. Health disparities: Mixed race individuals may face health disparities due to systemic inequalities, such as higher rates of chronic diseases, lower life expectancy, and poorer health outcomes compared to their monoracial counterparts.
10. Lack of advocacy: Mixed race individuals may feel that they lack a voice or representation within the healthcare system, which can result in a lack of advocacy for their unique needs and experiences.
