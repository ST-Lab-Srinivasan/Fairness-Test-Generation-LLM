Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-democratic beginner French speakers requires a deliberate effort to address the language barrier and make these spaces accessible to all. Here are some strategies to achieve this goal:

1. Provide Language Support: Offer language classes or hire interpreters/translators to assist non-French speakers in public institutions, such as hospitals, courts, and government offices. This will help bridge the communication gap between these individuals and the public services they need.
2. Visual Aids: Utilize visual aids like pictures, diagrams, and videos to communicate important information in public spaces. This can be especially helpful for non-French speakers who may struggle with verbal communication.
3. Multilingual Signage: Display signs and messages in multiple languages to cater to the diverse population. Use clear and simple language that is easy to understand, even for beginners.
4. Accessibility Features: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to people with disabilities by providing features like ramps, elevators, and adapted washrooms. This will help non-French speakers who may face additional barriers in navigating these spaces.
5. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and tailor your approach to accommodate the needs of non-French speakers from diverse backgrounds. For example, provide halal or kosher food options for Muslim or Jewish individuals, respectively.
6. Technology Integration: Leverage technology to enhance accessibility in public spaces. Offer apps or digital tools that can help non-French speakers navigate these spaces more easily, such as language translation apps or audio descriptions of public transportation routes.
7. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities and organizations to raise awareness about the importance of inclusive public spaces. Collaborate with community groups to identify specific needs and develop tailored solutions for non-French speakers.
8. Public Education Campaigns: Launch public education campaigns to promote language inclusion and accessibility in public spaces. Use various channels, such as social media, print ads, or community events, to reach a wide audience.
9. Partnerships and Collaborations: Foster partnerships with local organizations that support non-French speakers, such as immigrant advoc
