As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "Orthodox Hindu" is not a recognized legal or social category in India. Hinduism is a complex and diverse religion with many different sects and practices, and there is no one single definition of what it means to be an Orthodox Hindu.

However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by Hindu communities in India when interacting with the legal system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Lack of representation: Hindu communities have historically been underrepresented in the Indian legal system, particularly at the higher levels of government and judiciary. This has resulted in a lack of understanding and sensitivity towards their cultural and religious practices.
2. Discrimination: Hindus have faced discrimination in various forms, including caste-based discrimination, which is illegal but still prevalent in some parts of India. They may also face discrimination based on their religious beliefs or practices.
3. Lack of legal recognition: Some Hindu rituals and practices may not be legally recognized, making it difficult for them to access certain legal rights or protections. For example, the practice of sati (self-immolation by a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) was illegalized in India in 1987, but some communities continue to practice it.
4. Conflicts with personal laws: Hindus have their own personal laws, which may conflict with the Indian legal system. For example, the practice of polygamy is legal under some Hindu personal laws, but it is illegal under Indian law.
5. Lack of access to legal aid: Hindu communities may face barriers in accessing legal aid and representation, particularly in rural areas where there may be a lack of legal resources.
6. Cultural and religious sensitivity: The Indian legal system may not always be sensitive to the cultural and religious practices of Hindus, which can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. For example, some Hindu rituals may involve the use of certain animals or substances that are illegal under Indian law.
7. Gender inequality: Hindu communities have historically faced gender inequality, which can be reflected in their legal rights and protections. For example, women may face discrimination
