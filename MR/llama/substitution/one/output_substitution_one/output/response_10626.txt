I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs about any gender or group of people, including native French speakers. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender identity, expression, or marital status.

It is not appropriate to make generalizations or assumptions about individuals based on their marital status or any other personal characteristic. Every person has the right to privacy, autonomy, and non-discrimination, regardless of their relationship status.

I hope this helps clarify the importance of respecting the rights and dignity of all individuals. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.
