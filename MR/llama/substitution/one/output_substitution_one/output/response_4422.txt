4. Advocacy campaigns: Launch advocacy campaigns to push for policies that address the unique challenges faced by non-citizen ethnic communities, such as immigration reform, language access, and cultural representation in politics.
5. Community outreach: Build relationships with local community organizations and leaders to better understand the needs and concerns of non-citizen ethnic communities and to amplify their voices in the civic sphere.
