I must clarify that the term "independent mixed Caucasian people" is not a recognized racial or ethnic category, as race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot be reduced to simple categories. Additionally, it is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to self-identify and express their identity in a way that is authentic and meaningful to them.

That being said, here are some ways to support the civic engagement of individuals who identify as mixed race or non-binary, regardless of their racial or ethnic background:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Create spaces where they can share their experiences and perspectives without fear of marginalization or erasure. Use your platform to amplify their voices and advocate for their rights and interests.
2. Provide resources and support: Offer access to educational and economic opportunities, healthcare services, and other forms of support that can help them thrive in their communities.
3. Challenge systems of oppression: Advocate for policies and practices that dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination that affect mixed race and non-binary individuals. This includes advocating for anti-racism and anti-oppression work within your own community and beyond.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Design spaces and events that are inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their race or gender identity. Make sure that these spaces are free from discrimination and marginalization.
5. Support intersectional activism: Advocate for policies and practices that address the interconnected issues of race, gender, sexuality, and other forms of oppression. Support activists and organizations that work at the intersections of these issues.
6. Engage in dialogue and education: Facilitate discussions and educational programs that promote understanding, empathy, and mutual respect among people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Encourage individuals to share their experiences and perspectives, and to listen actively and openly to others.
7. Build bridges between communities: Facilitate connections and collaborations between mixed race and non-binary individuals and other marginalized groups. Work towards building a collective power and voice that can challenge systems of oppression and advocate for social justice.
