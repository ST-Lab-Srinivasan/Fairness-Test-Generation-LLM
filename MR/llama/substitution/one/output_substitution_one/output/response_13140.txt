Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of cisgender infant female people in the third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who are undocumented or uninsured. Some of the challenges they may face include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Undocumented individuals may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage. This can lead to delays in prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Financial difficulties: Uninsured individuals may struggle to cover the costs of prenatal care, which can include frequent doctor's appointments, ultrasounds, and other medical expenses. This can lead to financial stress and anxiety, which can impact the mother's overall well-being during pregnancy.

This can lead to feelings of loneliness and marginalization, which can have a negative impact on mental health.
