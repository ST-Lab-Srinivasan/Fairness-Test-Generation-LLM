Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Newly Married Beginner Caucasian Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly married beginner Caucasian speakers. This study aims to explore the impact of cultural heritage on the formation of identity among this group. Specifically, it will examine how cultural heritage influences their sense of self, values, beliefs, and practices.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity. It provides a framework for understanding oneself and the world around us. For newly married beginner Caucasian speakers, their cultural heritage can shape their sense of self and influence their values, beliefs, and practices.

For instance, research has shown that individuals from collectivist cultures tend to have a stronger sense of group identity than those from individualistic cultures (Hofstede, 1980). This means that newly married beginner Caucasian speakers from collectivist cultures may place a greater emphasis on their role within their family and community than those from individualistic cultures.

Similarly, cultural heritage can also influence an individual's values and beliefs. For example, research has shown that individuals from Confucian cultures tend to value filial piety and respect for authority more than those from Western cultures (Guthrie, 1980). This means that newly married beginner Caucasian speakers from Confucian cultures may place a greater emphasis on respecting their elders and following traditional norms.

Methodology:
To investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities of newly married beginner Caucasian speakers, this study will employ a mixed-methods approach. Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, and observations. The sample size will consist of 50 participants, aged 18-30, who are recently married and have a proficiency level of B2 or higher in English.

Surveys will be used to collect demographic information and assess the participants' sense of self, values, beliefs, and practices. Interviews will provide more in-depth insights into the participants' cultural
