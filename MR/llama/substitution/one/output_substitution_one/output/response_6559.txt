Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speakers can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that event organizers can use to make these events more accessible and welcoming. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide clear communication: Make sure that all event materials, including flyers, posters, and social media posts, are written in simple English and include a clear outline of the event's agenda, schedule, and location. This will help beginner English speakers understand what to expect and make the event more approachable.
2. Offer language support: Provide interpreters or translators at the event to help beginner English speakers communicate with others. You can also provide language learning resources, such as language learning apps or books, for attendees to use during the event.
3. Use visual aids: Visual aids, such as pictures and videos, can help beginner English speakers understand complex concepts and ideas. Use images and videos to illustrate key points and make the event more engaging.
4. Provide cultural context: Make sure that the event is culturally sensitive and inclusive. Provide information about the cultural background of the event's attendees, speakers, and performers. This will help beginner English speakers understand the cultural context of the event and feel more comfortable.
5. Use simple language: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be difficult for beginner English speakers to understand. Use simple language and avoid technical terms that may be unfamiliar to attendees.
6. Offer breaks: Provide regular breaks during the event to give attendees a chance to rest and recharge. This will help beginner English speakers who may need more time to process information or communicate with others.
7. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all attendees, regardless of their cultural background or language proficiency. Avoid using language that is offensive or insensitive to any group of people.
8. Provide feedback mechanisms: Encourage attendees to provide feedback throughout the event. Use surveys or other feedback mechanisms to gather input from beginner English speakers and make improvements for future events.
9. Collaborate with language learning organizations: Partner with local language learning organizations to promote the event and
