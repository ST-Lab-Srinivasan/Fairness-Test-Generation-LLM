Supporting non-democratic Mexican communities can be a complex and challenging task, as these communities often face significant barriers to accessing basic rights and services. However, there are several effective strategies that have been shown to support non-democratic Mexican communities:

1. Community Organizing: Building on the strengths and resources of the community itself is key to supporting non-democratic Mexican communities. This involves working with local leaders and residents to identify their needs and priorities, and mobilizing them to advocate for their rights and interests.
2. Participatory Governance: Encouraging participatory governance mechanisms can help ensure that the voices of marginalized communities are heard and represented in decision-making processes. This can involve establishing community-based governing bodies, or working with local government agencies to incorporate community perspectives into policy-making.

This can involve initiatives such as microfinance programs, entrepreneurship training, and supporting local businesses.

This can involve initiatives such as literacy programs, leadership development, and legal training.
