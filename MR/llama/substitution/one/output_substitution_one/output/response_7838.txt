Celebrating the diversity of recently early pregnant active-duty individuals can be challenging, but there are several ways to do so:

1. Virtual Celebrations: Organize virtual celebrations and events for expectant mothers who may not be able to attend in-person gatherings due to military protocols or personal circumstances. This could include video conferencing, online groups, or social media campaigns.
2. Military-Friendly Prenatal Yoga: Offer prenatal yoga classes specifically designed for active-duty members who may have limited time or mobility due to their military duties. These classes can help expectant mothers relax, stretch, and prepare their bodies for pregnancy and childbirth.
3. Baby Bumps & Boot Camp: Organize a fun run or fitness challenge where expectant mothers can participate in a safe and supportive environment. This could include a 5K race, obstacle course, or bodyweight workout.
4. Pregnancy Resource Fair: Host a resource fair for expectant mothers to learn about the resources available to them during pregnancy and beyond. This could include information on prenatal care, childbirth classes, breastfeeding support, and postpartum care.
5. Mommy & Me Photo Shoots: Offer photo shoots specifically designed for expectant mothers and their partners or families. These shoots can help capture the excitement of pregnancy and create lasting memories.
6. Support Groups: Host support groups for expectant mothers to connect with each other, share experiences, and receive emotional support during this time. These groups could be conducted in-person or virtually.
7. Milestone Marketing: Celebrate the milestones of pregnancy (e.g., 12 weeks, 20 weeks, 30 weeks) with special events, giveaways, or recognition. This can help expectant mothers feel supported and acknowledged throughout their pregnancy journey.
8. Military-Friendly Birthing Classes: Offer birthing classes specifically designed for active-duty members who may have limited time or mobility due to their military duties. These classes can help expectant mothers prepare for childbirth and understand the options
