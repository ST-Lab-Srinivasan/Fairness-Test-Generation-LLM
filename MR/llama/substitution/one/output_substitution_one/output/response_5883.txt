It is important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who identify as ethnically full Caucasian and practice Buddhism casually. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence an individual's identity:

1. Cultural practices and traditions: The cultural practices and traditions of a person's ancestors can shape their identity by influencing their beliefs, values, and behaviors. For example, if a person's ancestors were Buddhist, they may be more likely to practice Buddhist rituals and traditions, such as meditation or observing Buddhist holidays.
2. Language: The language spoken by a person's ancestors can also shape their identity. For example, if a person's ancestors spoke English, they may identify more strongly with Western culture and values.
3. Customs and traditions: The customs and traditions of a person's cultural heritage can also influence their identity. For example, if a person's ancestors had a strong tradition of storytelling or music-making, they may be more likely to identify with those aspects of their culture.
4. Historical events: Major historical events that have shaped a person's cultural heritage, such as colonization or migration, can also influence their identity. For example, if a person's ancestors were affected by colonization, they may identify more strongly with their indigenous culture and struggle for self-determination.
5. Intersectionality: It is important to recognize that cultural heritage is intersectional, meaning that it intersects with other aspects of a person's identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, and class. For example, a person who identifies as ethnically full Caucasian and practices Buddhism casually may also identify with other aspects of their cultural heritage, such as their gender or sexuality.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who identify as ethnically full Caucasian and practice Buddhism casually. It is important to recognize that cultural heritage is complex and multifaceted, and that it intersects with other aspects of an individual's identity.
