As a native English speaker, there are several challenges that I have encountered in the legal system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Language barriers: Non-native English speakers may face difficulties understanding complex legal concepts and terminology, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications. This can be particularly challenging for parties who are not fluent in English or who have limited legal knowledge.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system is shaped by cultural norms and values, and non-native English speakers may not be familiar with these cultural references.

8. Difficulty understanding legal jargon: Legal terminology can be complex and technical, even for native English speakers. Non
