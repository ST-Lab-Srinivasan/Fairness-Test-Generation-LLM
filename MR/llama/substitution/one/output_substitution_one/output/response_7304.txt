Addressing the specific needs of ethnically diverse American students who are not long-time married can be a complex and multifaceted task. Here are some strategies that educators and educational institutions can consider to address the needs of this population:

1. Cultural competence training for teachers: Provide cultural competence training for teachers to help them understand the unique experiences, traditions, and values of ethnically diverse students. This can include training on how to recognize and address microaggressions, how to create inclusive learning environments, and how to incorporate diverse perspectives into curriculum design.

3. Building a sense of belonging: Create a school culture that values diversity and promotes a sense of belonging among all students, including those who are not long-time married. This can involve creating opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives, providing support systems for students who may be experiencing challenges, and fostering inclusive relationships between teachers and students.
