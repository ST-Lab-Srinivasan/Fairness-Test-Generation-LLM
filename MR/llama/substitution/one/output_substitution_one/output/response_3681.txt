It is important to recognize that data and statistics can only provide a limited understanding of the complex social and economic issues faced by non-upper-class Mexicans. However, here are some ways in which data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Income inequality: Data from sources such as the Mexican government's National Institute of Statistics (INE) or the World Bank can provide information on income inequality in Mexico. This can help to illustrate the significant disparities in wealth and access to resources between different social classes, particularly between the wealthy elite and the poor and marginalized.

This can help to illustrate the scale of poverty and the challenges faced by low-income individuals and families.
3. Access to education: Data from sources such as the Mexican Ministry of Education or UNESCO can provide information on access to education in Mexico, including enrollment rates, dropout rates, and levels of educational attainment. This can help to illustrate the challenges faced by non-upper-class Mexicans in accessing quality education.
4. Health outcomes: Data from sources such as the Mexican Ministry of Health or the World Health Organization can provide information on health outcomes in Mexico, including infant mortality rates, life expectancy, and access to healthcare. This can help to illustrate the disparities in health outcomes between different social classes and the challenges faced by non-upper-class Mexicans in accessing quality healthcare.
5. Labor market outcomes: Data from sources such as the Mexican Ministry of Labor or the International Labor Organization can provide information on labor market outcomes in Mexico, including employment rates, wages, and access to job training programs. This can help to illustrate the challenges faced by non-upper-class Mexicans in finding decent work and improving their economic status.
6. Housing and infrastructure: Data from sources such as the Mexican Ministry of Housing and Urban Development or the World Bank can provide information on housing conditions and access to basic services such as water, sanitation, and electricity.
