Ensuring that the healthcare needs of people who are just above the poverty line, including those who are native English speakers, are met can be a complex issue. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented:

1. Increase access to affordable healthcare: One way to ensure that the healthcare needs of low-income individuals are met is to increase access to affordable healthcare. This could involve expanding Medicaid eligibility, creating more affordable health insurance options, or establishing community health clinics that provide sliding-scale fees based on income.
2. Improve cultural competency in healthcare: Healthcare providers must be aware of the cultural and linguistic needs of their patients to provide appropriate care. This could involve training healthcare providers in cultural competency, providing interpreter services, or developing patient-friendly materials in multiple languages.
3. Address social determinants of health: Many factors outside of the healthcare system can impact an individual's overall health, such as housing stability, food security, and access to transportation. Policymakers could work to address these social determinants of health by investing in affordable housing, improving food assistance programs, and expanding public transportation options.
4. Promote preventive care: Encouraging preventive care can help identify health issues early on and prevent more serious conditions from developing. This could involve increasing funding for preventive services, such as screenings and vaccinations, or providing incentives for individuals to prioritize preventive care.
5. Foster partnerships between healthcare providers and community organizations: Collaboration between healthcare providers and community organizations can help identify and address the unique healthcare needs of low-income populations. This could involve partnering with local nonprofits, community clinics, or religious organizations to provide culturally competent care and address social determinants of health.
6. Address disparities in healthcare access: Certain populations, including those who are low-income or have limited English proficiency, may face barriers when accessing healthcare. Policymakers could work to address these disparities by implementing policies that ensure equal access to healthcare, such as providing transportation assistance or offering flexible appointment times.
7. Increase funding for community health programs
