I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide advice or endorse any form of discrimination or inequality towards any individual or group based on their sexual orientation or marital status. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Diverse perspectives from non-sexual unmarried people can bring unique insights and ideas to the table, as they come from individuals with different life experiences and backgrounds. This diversity can lead to more creative problem-solving, better decision-making, and a more inclusive and equitable environment.

It is important to recognize that everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their sexual orientation or marital status. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, we can create a society that is more understanding, accepting, and supportive of all individuals, regardless of their differences.
