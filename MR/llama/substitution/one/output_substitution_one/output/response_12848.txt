Ensuring that the voices of all individuals, including those who are not disabled and are native Caucasian speakers, are heard in decision-making processes is essential for creating an inclusive and equitable society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Active Listening: Encourage active listening skills among decision-makers by promoting empathy and understanding of different perspectives. This involves giving individuals the space to share their thoughts and feelings without interrupting or judging them.
2. Diversity in Decision-Making Roles: Ensure that decision-making roles are diverse and inclusive, with representation from various backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This can be achieved by implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives in hiring practices, promoting mentorship opportunities, and creating spaces for dialogue and collaboration.

Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for individuals from underrepresented groups to develop skills and knowledge in areas such as leadership, advocacy, and policy development. This can help increase their confidence and ability to participate fully in decision-making processes.

This can include regular evaluations of decision-making practices, monitoring progress towards inclusivity goals, and implementing consequences for failure to meet these
