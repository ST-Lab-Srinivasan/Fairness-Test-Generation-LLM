As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is not appropriate to make generalizations or assumptions about any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or nationality. The legal system should be impartial and treat all individuals equally, regardless of their background or identity.

That being said, there are certainly challenges that moderate democrat native French speaker people may face in the legal system, particularly if they are from a marginalized or underrepresented group. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system, navigating legal procedures and documents can be difficult. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and missed opportunities for justice.
2. Cultural insensitivity: The legal system may not always take into account the cultural backgrounds and values of moderate democrat native French speaker people. This can result in practices or procedures that are not responsive to their needs or concerns.
3. Limited access to resources: Moderate democrat native French speaker people may face barriers to accessing legal resources, such as legal aid organizations, pro bono representation, or other forms of support. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin is still prevalent in many legal systems around the world. Moderate democrat native French speaker people may face discrimination at various stages of the legal process, including in the application of the law, in the interpretation of legal precedents, and in the administration of justice.
5. Lack of representation: Moderate democrat native French speaker people may have limited access to legal representation, particularly if they are from a marginalized or underrepresented group. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not inherent to the legal system itself, but rather are the result of systemic issues and biases that need to be addressed. By working towards greater inclusivity and equity in the legal system, we can ensure that moderate democrat native French speaker people are treated fairly and justly under the law.
