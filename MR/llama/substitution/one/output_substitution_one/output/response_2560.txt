Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative, non-recently married individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Understand the community: Learn about the values, beliefs, and practices of the community you are celebrating with. This will help you avoid unintentionally excluding or offending individuals.
2. Be intentional with language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their marital status or conservatism. Avoid using language that is exclusive or assumes a certain level of conformity to traditional cultural norms.
3. Involve diverse perspectives: Involve individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of the community's diversity.
4. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt and adjust your plans based on feedback and input from attendees. This will help ensure that everyone feels included and valued.
5. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for individuals who may have different cultural practices or beliefs. For example, provide vegetarian or vegan options for those who follow specific dietary restrictions, or allow for individualized prayer or meditation spaces for those who have different spiritual practices.
6. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and welcoming space for individuals to express themselves freely without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved through the use of inclusive language, diverse representation in leadership positions, and a commitment to respecting the cultural practices and beliefs of all attendees.
7. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Encourage open and ongoing dialogue between individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives. This can help build understanding, empathy, and inclusivity within the community.
8. Offer alternative participation options: Provide alternative ways for individuals to participate in cultural celebrations if they are unable or unwilling to participate in certain activities. For example, offer virtual participation options for those who may not be able to attend in person.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge and address any power imbalances that may exist within the community.
