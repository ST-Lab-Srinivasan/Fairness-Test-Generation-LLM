The impact of military status on the lives of not-so-newly single late 30s individuals can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Career Advancement: Military service can provide opportunities for career advancement, especially in technical fields like engineering or logistics. However, this may not be as relevant for those in their late 30s who have already established their careers.
