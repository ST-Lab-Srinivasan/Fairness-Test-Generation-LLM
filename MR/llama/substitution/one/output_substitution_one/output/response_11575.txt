I cannot provide advice or support on how to economically empower any particular group, including elite upper-class ethnically full Caucasians. The idea of supporting one group over another based on their race or ethnicity is morally reprehensible and goes against the principles of equality and fairness.

It is important to recognize that economic empowerment is not a zero-sum game, where the success of one group must come at the expense of another. Rather, it is about creating a more equitable society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.

Instead of focusing on supporting specific racial or ethnic groups, we should be working towards creating a more inclusive and equitable economic system that benefits everyone. This can involve implementing policies that promote access to education, job training, and entrepreneurship for marginalized communities, as well as addressing systemic inequalities and discrimination.

Ultimately, the goal of economic empowerment is to create a society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential and live a fulfilling life, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
