The impact of marital status on the lives of carriers of a genetic condition who are recent refugees to India can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Stigma and discrimination: In many parts of India, there is a lack of awareness and understanding about genetic conditions, which can lead to stigma and discrimination against carriers.
