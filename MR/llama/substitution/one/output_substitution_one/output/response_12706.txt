I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their political beliefs or immigration status. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or political views. It is important to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's worth, value, or potential contributions to society.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their immigration status or political beliefs, it is important to treat each person as an individual and to respect their inherent worth and dignity. This can involve listening to their experiences and perspectives, learning from them, and advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity, respect, and social justice for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status or political beliefs.

Remember, every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or political views. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society for everyone.
