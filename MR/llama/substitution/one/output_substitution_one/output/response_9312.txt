Supporting the social inclusion of beginner French speakers who are long-term single individuals can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Language exchange programs: Organize or participate in language exchange programs where the beginner French speaker can practice speaking with native French speakers. This will help them improve their speaking skills and build confidence in using the language.
2. Cultural events: Encourage the beginner French speaker to attend cultural events where they can interact with other French speakers, such as festivals, concerts, or exhibitions.
