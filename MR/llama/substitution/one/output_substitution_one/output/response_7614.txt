However, there are some common challenges that have been identified by researchers and experts in the field. Here are a few:

1. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system can be complex and nuanced, and it is important for beginner French speakers to understand the cultural context in which it operates. This includes being aware of the legal traditions and practices of different cultures, as well as the social and historical factors that shape the legal system.
2. Bias and stereotyping: Unfortunately, there are instances of bias and stereotyping in the legal system, particularly against marginalized communities. Beginner French speakers may face discrimination or be subject to assumptions based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background.
