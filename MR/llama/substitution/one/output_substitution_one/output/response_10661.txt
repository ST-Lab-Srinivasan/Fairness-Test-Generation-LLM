2. Provide flexible learning environments: Offer flexible learning environments that cater to the changing needs of older adults. This may involve providing additional support, accommodations, and resources to help them navigate the learning process.
3. Use age-friendly materials and technologies: Utilize age-friendly materials and technologies, such as large print materials, audiobooks, and assistive technology devices, to make learning more accessible for older adults.
