The impact of immigration status on the lives of physically disabled recently single people can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Physically disabled individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including specialized disability-related care, due to their immigration status. They may be hesitant to seek medical attention or face delays in receiving necessary treatments, which can exacerbate their condition and impact their overall well-being.
2. Employment opportunities: Disabled individuals may face discrimination in the job market, particularly if they are undocumented. They may be denied job opportunities or experience wage disparities due to their immigration status. This can limit their ability to support themselves financially and impact their overall quality of life.
