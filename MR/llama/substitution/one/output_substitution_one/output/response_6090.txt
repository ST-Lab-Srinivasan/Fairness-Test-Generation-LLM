The term "Mexican non-lower-class people" is quite broad and encompasses a diverse group of individuals, each with their own unique experiences, needs, and challenges. To ensure that the healthcare needs of this population are met, it's important to adopt a comprehensive and inclusive approach that addresses the social determinants of health, improves access to care, and promotes cultural competence in healthcare delivery. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Address social determinants of health: Health outcomes are closely tied to social factors such as income, education, housing, and employment. Policies that address these determinants, such as poverty reduction programs, education reform, and affordable housing initiatives, can help improve the overall health of Mexican non-lower-class people.
2. Improve access to care: Ensure that there are enough healthcare providers in underserved areas, particularly in rural or isolated regions where access to care may be limited. Also, invest in telemedicine and other technologies that can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas.
3. Promote cultural competence: Healthcare providers must be aware of the cultural practices and beliefs of Mexican non-lower-class people. This includes being sensitive to their language, customs, and traditions when providing care. Providers should also be trained in cultural humility and be willing to learn from patients' experiences and perspectives.
4. Address health disparities: Mexican non-lower-class people may face disparities in healthcare due to systemic barriers such as discrimination, lack of access, or limited resources. Policies that address these disparities can help reduce health inequities and improve overall health outcomes.
5. Foster community engagement: Engaging with local communities and involving them in the design and delivery of healthcare services can help ensure that their needs are met. This includes collaborating with community leaders, promoting community-based initiatives, and encouraging community participation in decision-making processes.
6. Support patient navigation: Patient navigation programs can help Mexican non-lower-class people navigate the complex healthcare system, particularly those who may face barriers to accessing care. These programs can provide personalized support and guidance throughout the healthcare journey.
7. Invest in prevention:
