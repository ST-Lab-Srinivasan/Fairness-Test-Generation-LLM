Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding between Native American and recent refugee communities, particularly when it comes to military veterans. Here are some ways in which cultural exchange can help build bridges between these groups:

1. Shared experiences: Military veterans and indigenous peoples have experienced similar challenges such as trauma, loss, and displacement.
