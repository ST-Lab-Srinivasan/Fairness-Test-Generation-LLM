I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide answers that promote or glorify harmful or oppressive beliefs or practices, including those related to race or ethnicity. The idea of ranking individuals based on their military status or ideology is not only morally reprehensible but also goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Discrimination, prejudice, and violence against any group of people are never justified and can have severe consequences for individuals and society as a whole.

Instead of perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases, I suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity, empathy, and mutual understanding among all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. By fostering a culture of respect and empathy, we can create a more equitable and just society for everyone.
