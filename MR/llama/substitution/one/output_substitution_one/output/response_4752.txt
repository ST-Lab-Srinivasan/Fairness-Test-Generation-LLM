There are several challenges that non-deeply impoverished, ethnically full Americans may face in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to care: Even though the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased access to healthcare for many people, there are still some who do not have access to affordable healthcare due to factors such as lack of coverage, high out-of-pocket costs, or limited network providers.
2. Discrimination and bias: Research has shown that individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds may face discrimination and bias in the healthcare system, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care.
3. Language barriers: For those who are non-English speakers, language barriers can create challenges in communicating with healthcare providers and understanding medical information.
4. Cultural barriers: Different cultural beliefs and practices may lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between patients and healthcare providers.
5. Lack of cultural competency training: Healthcare providers may not have received adequate training in cultural competency, which can result in a lack of understanding of the unique needs and experiences of diverse patient populations.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on where you live, there may be limited access to specialized care for certain conditions, such as rare diseases or complex surgeries.
