Ensuring the housing needs of older adults, particularly those over the age of 90, can be challenging due to various factors such as declining physical abilities, limited financial resources, and lack of accessibility in many existing housing options. However, there are several strategies that can help meet their housing needs:

1. Age-Friendly Housing: Develop age-friendly housing options that cater to the specific needs of older adults, such as single-story homes with wide hallways and doors, accessible bathrooms, and safety features like grab bars and non-slip surfaces.
2. Home Modifications: Provide financial assistance or incentives for homeowners to modify their homes to make them more accessible and safe for older adults, such as installing ramps, widening doorways, and adding handrails.
3. Housing with Support Services: Develop housing options that offer support services such as meal preparation, transportation, and personal care, which can help alleviate some of the burdens of aging in place.
4. Co-housing Communities: Create co-housing communities where older adults can live in close proximity to peers and have access to shared amenities, social activities, and support services.
5. Affordable Housing Options: Work with local governments and non-profit organizations to develop affordable housing options specifically designed for older adults, such as senior apartments or retirement communities.
6. Technology Integration: Incorporate technology solutions that can help older adults maintain their independence, such as smart home devices, medical alert systems, and video conferencing tools.
7. Intergenerational Housing: Create housing options that bring together people of different age groups, fostering intergenerational relationships and mutual support.
8. Community Outreach: Develop partnerships with local organizations and community groups to provide outreach and support services specifically tailored to the needs of older adults.
9. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that prioritize affordable housing options for older adults, increase funding for home modifications, and promote age-friendly design standards for new developments.
10. Education and Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of age-friendly housing
