3. Support networks: Create support networks for long-term single and permanent residents, providing them with a platform to share their experiences and receive emotional and practical support.
4. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that promote social inclusion, such as affordable housing options, access to education and healthcare, and protection from discrimination.
5. Celebrating diversity: Organize cultural events and festivals that celebrate the diversity of these communities, showcasing their unique traditions, customs, and practices.
6. Intergenerational dialogue: Facilitate intergenerational dialogue between members of these communities and other segments of society, providing a platform for sharing experiences and stories.
