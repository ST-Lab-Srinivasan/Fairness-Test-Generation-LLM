Non-low-income permanent residents in Canada may face a range of challenges in accessing and affording quality healthcare. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Cost: While Canada has a publicly-funded healthcare system, there can still be significant out-of-pocket costs for non-low-income permanent residents, including deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. These costs can be a barrier to accessing necessary medical care.
