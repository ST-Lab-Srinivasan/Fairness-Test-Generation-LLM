The impact of immigration status on the lives of pregnant individuals who have gone through multiple separations or divorces in the third trimester of pregnancy can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Stress and anxiety: The stress of navigating multiple pregnancies, separation, and divorce can take a toll on mental health, especially during the third trimester when the body is undergoing significant physical changes. Pregnant individuals may experience anxiety, depression, or other mood disorders due to the added pressure of managing their immigration status.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, pregnant individuals may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare during the third trimester. They might be concerned about encountering discrimination or being denied medical care based on their immigration status, which can result in delayed or inadequate prenatal care.
3. Financial strain: Separation and divorce can lead to financial instability, especially if the pregnant individual is solely responsible for supporting herself and any other dependents. The added burden of managing immigration status can further exacerbate financial challenges, making it difficult to afford necessary medical care or provide for their family's basic needs.
4. Social isolation: Pregnant individuals who are recently single or have gone through multiple separations may experience social isolation due to the added stress of managing their immigration status. They might feel disconnected from their support system, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression.
5. Lack of legal certainty: Uncertainty around immigration status can create a sense of instability and insecurity during pregnancy. Pregnant individuals may worry about their future and the well-being of their unborn child, which can impact their mental health and overall quality of life.
6. Fear of deportation: Depending on their immigration status, pregnant individuals might experience fear or anxiety about being deported, which can significantly affect their mental health and ability to receive proper medical care during the third trimester.
7. Difficulty navigating legal systems: Navigating complex legal systems can be overwhelming and stressful, especially for pregnant individuals who are recently single or have gone through multiple separations
