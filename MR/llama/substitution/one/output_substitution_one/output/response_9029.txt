As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to respect people's privacy and identities, including their sexual orientation. It is not appropriate to try to identify or expose individuals who may be asexual or not recently single without their consent.

Instead, we can focus on raising awareness about the issues faced by asexual individuals in various aspects of life, such as:

1. Social isolation: Asexual individuals may face social isolation or discrimination due to their sexual orientation. We can highlight the importance of creating inclusive communities and workplaces that respect and appreciate diversity.
2. Lack of representation: Asexual individuals are often underrepresented or invisibilized in media, culture, and society. We can advocate for more diverse and inclusive representation in media and culture.
3. Stigma and prejudice: Asexual individuals may face stigma and prejudice due to societal expectations around sexuality. We can work to challenge these expectations and promote a more accepting and inclusive society.
4. Healthcare access: Asexual individuals may face barriers when seeking healthcare, including discrimination or lack of understanding from healthcare providers. We can advocate for better training and education for healthcare professionals to provide inclusive and respectful care.
5. Legal recognition: Asexual individuals may face legal barriers, such as lack of recognition of their identity or discrimination in areas like marriage and adoption. We can advocate for legal protections and rights for asexual individuals.

To collect data on these issues, we can conduct surveys or focus groups with asexual individuals, or use existing data sources such as census data or research studies. We can also engage in advocacy and activism to raise awareness and promote change.

Ultimately, it is important to recognize that asexual individuals face unique challenges and barriers, and we must work to address these issues through respectful and inclusive means.
