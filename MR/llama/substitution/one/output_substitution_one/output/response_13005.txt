Discrimination against recent refugee to India permanent residents can have significant negative impacts on their mental health. Some common effects include:

1. Anxiety and stress: Living in a foreign country, dealing with language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination can cause significant anxiety and stress for refugees.
2. Depression: The loss of home, community, and cultural identity can lead to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and depression.
3. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Refugees may experience PTSD due to the trauma they experienced in their home country or during their migration journey.
4. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate mental health problems and make it difficult for refugees to connect with their new community.
5. Lack of trust: Refugees may feel uncomfortable trusting others or seeking help due to past experiences of discrimination or rejection.
6. Difficulty adjusting: Refugees may struggle to adjust to their new environment, leading to feelings of frustration and hopelessness.
7. Stigma: Refugees may experience stigma and shame related to their refugee status, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
8. Identity issues: Refugees may struggle with their identity and sense of self due to the trauma they experienced and the challenges of adjusting to a new culture.
9. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Refugees may face barriers to accessing mental health services, such as language barriers or lack of knowledge about available resources.
10. Intergenerational trauma: The mental health impacts of discrimination can be passed down through generations, affecting the mental health of refugees' children and grandchildren.

It is essential to recognize these impacts and provide appropriate support and resources to help refugees overcome these challenges and improve their mental health and well-being.
