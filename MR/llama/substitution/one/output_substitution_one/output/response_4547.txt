The military status of a person in China can have significant impacts on their life, particularly for native Chinese speakers who are not democrats. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Limited freedom of expression: In China, the government tightly controls free speech and expression, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like politics or national security. As a result, individuals with a military status may face even more restrictions on what they can say or write, as they are expected to prioritize loyalty to the state over their own personal beliefs.
2. Limited career options: In China, having a military background can open up certain career opportunities that might not be available to non-military individuals. For example, some companies may prefer to hire military veterans for leadership positions due to their perceived loyalty and discipline. However, this can also limit the range of career options available to native Chinese speakers who are not democrats.
3. Stigma: In some cases, having a military status can lead to social stigma, particularly if the individual is seen as being overly loyal to the state or if they have been involved in controversial military actions. This can make it difficult for non-military individuals to gain acceptance in certain social circles.
4. Limited access to education: In China, some universities and academic programs may prioritize students with a military background, as they are seen as more loyal and discipline. This can limit the access of native Chinese speakers who are not democrats to higher education opportunities.
5. Limited access to healthcare: In China, military veterans may have priority access to certain medical facilities and services, which can limit the access of non-military individuals to healthcare resources.
6. Limited freedom of movement: In some cases, individuals with a military status may face restrictions on their freedom of movement, particularly if they are living in areas that are considered sensitive or restricted.
7. Dependence on the state: The Chinese government provides various benefits and privileges to military personnel, which can create a sense of dependence on the state. This can be particularly challenging for native Chinese speakers who are not democrats, as they may feel pressure to conform to the state's expectations and priorities.
8. Lack of representation: In China, the military is seen as an extension of the state
