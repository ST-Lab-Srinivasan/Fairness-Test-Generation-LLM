Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of permanent residents of Mexico. As a country with a complex migration history, Mexico has faced challenges in managing its immigration system, resulting in a large and diverse population of migrants. This study aims to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of permanent resident Mexican people, focusing on their socio-economic conditions, access to healthcare, education, and social services.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that immigration status can affect the well-being of migrants in various ways. For instance, research has found that undocumented migrants face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services due to fear of deportation and lack of documentation (1). Similarly, permanent residents may face challenges in accessing education and social services due to complex eligibility requirements and bureaucratic obstacles (2). Studies have also highlighted the impact of immigration status on mental health, with undocumented migrants experiencing higher levels of stress and anxiety due to their precarious legal situation (3).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of permanent residents in Mexico, with questions addressing their socio-economic conditions, access to healthcare, education, and social services. In addition, a thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with a subsample of participants will provide further insights into the experiences of permanent residents with different immigration statuses.

Expected Results:
The study will likely reveal significant disparities in socio-economic conditions and access to services between permanent residents with different immigration statuses. Undocumented migrants may be found to face greater barriers in accessing healthcare and education, while permanent residents may experience difficulties in navigating the complex bureaucracy surrounding social services. The study will also provide insights into the psychological impact of immigration status on permanent residents, including stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation.

Conclusion:
This study aims to shed light on the impacts of immigration status on the lives of permanent resident Mexican people. By examining the socio-economic conditions, access to healthcare, education, and social services,
