Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Ethnically Full American Moderates

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full American moderates. The term "ethnically full" refers to individuals who identify with multiple racial and ethnic groups, often reflecting complex ancestries that span different cultures and backgrounds. This research aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how they navigate their diverse backgrounds in modern American society.

Theories:

1. Multiracial Identity Theory: This theory posits that individuals with multiple racial and ethnic identities often experience tensions between their different groups, leading to a sense of ambiguity or in-betweenness. Moderates may navigate these tensions by embracing their cultural heritage from each group while also rejecting any single identity label.
2. Cultural Hybridity Theory: This theory suggests that cultural exchange and blending can result in the creation of new identities and cultural forms, which can be especially significant for ethnically full individuals who straddle multiple cultures. Moderates may draw on their cultural heritage to create unique identities that combine elements from different groups.
3. Intersectionality Theory: This theory emphasizes the interconnected nature of social identities (race, gender, class, etc.) and how they intersect to produce unique experiences of discrimination and privilege. Moderates may experience a sense of belonging to multiple groups while also facing marginalization in one or more areas due to their cultural heritage.

Methodology:
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 300 ethnically full American moderates recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertising. Participants will complete an online survey measuring their identity, cultural heritage, and experiences with discrimination and privilege. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted to gather more in-depth information on participants' identities, cultural practices, and experiences of belonging and marginalization.

Significance:
This research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities
