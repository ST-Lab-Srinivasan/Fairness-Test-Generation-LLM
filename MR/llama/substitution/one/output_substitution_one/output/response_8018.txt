I must clarify that "Mexican strong Hindu individuals" is a contradictory term, as Mexico is a country located in North America and Hinduism is a religion primarily practiced in India. Therefore, it is not possible to create inclusive social policies for this group, as they do not exist.

However, if you are referring to individuals who identify as Hindu and are of Mexican descent, there are several ways to create more inclusive social policies that respect and recognize their identity:

1. Acknowledge and validate their identity: Recognize the importance of cultural diversity and the value of preserving cultural heritage. Acknowledge the unique experiences and perspectives of Hindu individuals of Mexican descent, and validate their identity as a valuable contribution to society.
2. Provide education and awareness: Educate the broader community about the history and practices of Hinduism, and raise awareness about the challenges faced by Hindu individuals of Mexican descent. This can help dispel stereotypes and misconceptions, and promote greater understanding and acceptance.
3. Promote inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusion, such as language support services, cultural events, and religious accommodations in the workplace or educational institutions.
4. Support community building: Encourage the formation of Hindu communities and organizations that provide a space for individuals to practice their religion and connect with others who share their identity.
5. Advocate for legal recognition: Advocate for legal recognition of Hinduism as an official religion in Mexico, which can help protect the rights of Hindu individuals and promote greater acceptance and understanding of their beliefs.
6. Provide access to religious resources: Ensure that Hindu individuals have access to religious texts, sacred symbols, and other resources that are important for their practice of the faith.
7. Promote interfaith dialogue: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between different religious communities, including Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and others. This can help promote greater understanding and respect for each other's beliefs and practices.
8. Address discrimination and marginalization: Work to address any forms of discrimination or marginalization faced by Hindu individuals of Mexican descent, such as employment discrimination or social exclusion.
