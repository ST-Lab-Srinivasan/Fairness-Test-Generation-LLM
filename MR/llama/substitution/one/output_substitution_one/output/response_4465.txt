5. Accommodations and Supports: Ensure that educational institutions have accommodations and supports in place for refugee students, such as interpreters, note-takers, and flexible scheduling.
6. Community Involvement: Engage with local communities and organizations to raise awareness about the challenges faced by recent refugees. This can help build a more supportive and inclusive environment for these individuals.
7. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that refugees have access to quality healthcare services, including mental health support. This can help address any underlying issues that may impact their educational success.
8. Financial Support: Provide financial assistance to refugees to help them cover education-related expenses, such as tuition fees and textbook costs.
