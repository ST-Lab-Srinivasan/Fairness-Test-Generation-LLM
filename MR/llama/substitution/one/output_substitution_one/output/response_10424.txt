As a beginner English speaker and a native natural-born US citizen, there can be several challenges faced in the legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in English, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging. They may struggle to understand legal terminology, read and write legal documents, or communicate effectively with legal professionals.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the US is based on common law, which can be unfamiliar to individuals from other cultures. Additionally, cultural norms and values may differ, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications in legal interactions.
