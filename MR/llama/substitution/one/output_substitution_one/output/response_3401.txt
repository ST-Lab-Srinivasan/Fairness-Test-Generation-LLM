As an AI language model, I don't have access to personal information or demographic data about individuals. However, I can provide some general challenges that older adults, including those who are advanced beginners or over 85 years old, may face in the healthcare system:

1. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is still prevalent in society, and older adults may encounter discrimination or stereotyping in the healthcare system. Providers may assume that they are unable to make decisions about their care or that they don't need to be involved in their treatment plans.
2. Limited access to healthcare providers: Older adults may have difficulty accessing healthcare providers due to mobility issues, transportation challenges, or a lack of providers in their area who specialize in geriatric care.
3. Complex medical needs: Older adults often have multiple chronic conditions that require complex and coordinated care. They may need to navigate multiple providers and appointments to manage these conditions, which can be overwhelming and time-consuming.
4. Medication management: Older adults may take multiple medications, which can lead to drug interactions, side effects, or confusion about dosages and schedules. Providers may not always consider potential interactions between medications or address concerns about polypharmacy.

Lack of trust in the healthcare system: Some older adults may have had negative experiences with the healthcare system in the past, leading to a lack of trust in providers or the medical establishment as a whole. This can make it difficult for them to seek care or follow treatment recommendations.
