Supporting the civic engagement of refugee natural-born US citizens, permanent residents, and other marginalized communities is crucial for the health of democracy. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Voter Registration Drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting refugee communities. This can be done through partnerships with local organizations, community events, or even online registration campaigns.
2. Civics Education: Provide access to high-quality civics education programs that focus on the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. This can include classes on voting, the Constitution, and government structures.
3. Language Accessibility: Ensure that critical information is available in the languages spoken by refugee communities. This can include providing interpreters at polling stations, translation services for voter registration forms, and multilingual education materials.
4. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair experienced voters with new citizens. This can help refugees navigate the voting process and build connections with their communities.
5. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to educate refugee communities about their rights and responsibilities as US citizens. This can include hosting town halls, cultural events, and one-on-one meetings with community leaders.
6. Advocacy and Activism: Support advocacy and activism efforts that amplify the voices of refugee communities. This can involve partnering with organizations that advocate for their rights and interests or participating in campaigns that promote social justice and civic engagement.
7. Technology Access: Ensure that refugees have access to technology that can facilitate their civic engagement, such as online voter registration systems, digital resources for civics education, and social media platforms for organizing and mobilizing.
8. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Work closely with community organizations that serve refugee populations, such as resettlement agencies, cultural centers, and religious institutions. These partnerships can help reach a wider audience and provide more targeted support.
9. Legal Services: Provide access to legal services that can help refugees navigate the complexities of US citizenship and voting processes. This can include assistance with naturalization applications, voter registration, and election-day logistics.
