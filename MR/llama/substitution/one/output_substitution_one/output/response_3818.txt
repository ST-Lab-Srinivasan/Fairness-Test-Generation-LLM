Individuals who lack legal immigration status, also known as "without papers," face significant challenges when seeking medical care and accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Difficulty accessing healthcare facilities: Without legal immigration status, undocumented individuals may be afraid to seek medical care in hospitals or clinics due to fear of deportation or detention. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems and make it more difficult to manage chronic conditions.
2. Limited access to health insurance: Undocumented individuals may not be eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs, leaving them with limited options for affordable healthcare coverage. They may also face barriers in accessing private insurance due to their immigration status.
3. Language barriers: Many undocumented individuals may not speak English fluently, which can create communication challenges when interacting with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about medical conditions, treatments, and follow-up care.
4. Fear of discrimination: Undocumented individuals may be hesitant to seek medical care due to concerns about discrimination or stigma related to their immigration status. This fear can lead to delayed or avoided care, which can have serious consequences for their health.
5. Limited cultural competency training: Healthcare providers may not receive adequate cultural competency training to address the unique needs and concerns of undocumented patients. This can result in a lack of understanding and empathy when interacting with these individuals.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Undocumented individuals may struggle to navigate complex medical systems, including finding the right providers, understanding insurance policies, and accessing necessary resources.
7. Lack of trust in the healthcare system: Due to historical and contemporary factors related to immigration and healthcare policy, undocumented individuals may not have full faith in the healthcare system's ability to provide quality care. This mistrust can lead to reluctance to seek medical attention when needed.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Undocumented individuals may face challenges accessing specialized care, such as mental health services or advanced medical treatments
