Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner English speaker cisgender elderly male individuals. Marriage is a social institution that can bring many benefits, such as emotional support, financial stability, and social recognition. However, it can also create challenges, particularly for older adults who may face physical, cognitive, or social limitations. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner English speaker cisgender elderly male individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect various aspects of older adults' lives, including their mental and physical health, social engagement, and financial security (1,2). For example, married older adults tend to have better mental and physical health than their unmarried counterparts (3), and they are more likely to participate in social activities and volunteer work (4). However, some studies have also found that marriage can lead to increased stress and burden for caregivers, particularly women (5).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. A total of 20 beginner English speaker cisgender elderly male individuals will be recruited from local community centers or online platforms. Participants will complete a survey assessing their marital status, social engagement, mental health, and financial security. In addition, five participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to explore their experiences and perceptions of marital status.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner English speaker cisgender elderly male individuals. The findings will provide insights into how marital status affects various aspects of their lives, including mental and physical health, social engagement, and financial security. The results will also inform the development of interventions and policies aimed at improving the well-being of older adults in society.
