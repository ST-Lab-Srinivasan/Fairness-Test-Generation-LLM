Addressing the specific needs of separated beginner English speakers in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies that educators can use to support these individuals:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Beginner English speakers may feel intimidated or uncomfortable in a traditional classroom setting. To address this, educators can create a warm and inclusive environment by using visual aids, gestures, and simple language to help them understand the lesson.
2. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and videos can help beginner English speakers understand complex concepts more easily. Educators can use these tools to illustrate vocabulary words, grammar rules, and other key concepts.
3. Provide individualized support: Beginner English speakers may need additional support to keep up with their peers. Educators can provide individualized support by offering extra help sessions, one-on-one tutoring, or small group instruction.
4. Use authentic materials: Using authentic materials such as news articles, videos, and songs can help beginner English speakers develop their listening and reading comprehension skills. These materials can also provide a window into the culture and language of the target country.
5. Foster a positive learning environment: Beginner English speakers may feel anxious or stressed about learning a new language. Educators can foster a positive learning environment by promoting a sense of community, encouraging peer-to-peer support, and creating opportunities for students to share their experiences and insights.
6. Encourage self-directed learning: Beginner English speakers may need more time and practice to develop their language skills. Educators can encourage self-directed learning by providing access to online resources, language learning apps, and other tools that can help students learn at their own pace.
7. Provide opportunities for communication: Communication is a key component of language learning. Educators can provide opportunities for beginner English speakers to practice speaking and listening through role-playing exercises, group discussions, and presentations.
8. Be patient and understanding: Beginner English speakers may make mistakes or struggle with certain concepts. Educators should be patient and understanding, and provide feedback that is constructive and supportive.
