Highlighting the issues faced by deep in poverty recent refugees to the US can be a complex and sensitive topic, but using data can provide valuable insights and help raise awareness of their challenges. Here are some ways data can be used to highlight these issues:

1. Poverty rates: Refugees are more likely to experience poverty than the overall US population. According to a 2020 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research, refugees are estimated to have a poverty rate of around 30%, compared to around 12% for the overall US population. Using data on poverty rates can help illustrate the scale of this issue.
2. Employment barriers: Refugees often face significant barriers to employment in the US, including lack of work experience, limited English proficiency, and discrimination. Data on employment rates and job placement can help highlight these challenges. For example, a 2019 report by the International Rescue Committee found that only around 5% of refugees were employed in their field of expertise within two years of arriving in the US.
3. Health disparities: Refugees may experience poor health outcomes due to trauma, malnutrition, and limited access to healthcare. Data on health outcomes, such as infant mortality rates or mental health prevalence, can help illustrate these disparities. A 2019 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that refugees had higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than the overall US population.
4. Housing insecurity: Refugees may face challenges accessing stable and affordable housing, which can exacerbate poverty and other issues. Data on housing insecurity, such as homelessness rates or lack of access to affordable housing, can help highlight these challenges. A 2018 report by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans found that around 15% of homeless adults in the US were refugees or asylum seekers.
5. Educational disparities: Refugees may face barriers to accessing quality education, which can impact their long-term economic prospects. Data on educational outcomes, such as high school graduation
