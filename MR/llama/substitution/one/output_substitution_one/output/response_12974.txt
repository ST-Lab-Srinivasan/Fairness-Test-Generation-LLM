Celebrating the cultural contributions of recently single early pregnancy (1st trimester) people can be a thoughtful and supportive gesture. Here are some ideas:

1. Host a virtual baby shower: Organize an online baby shower for the expectant mother, where friends and family can participate in games, activities, and gift-giving from the comfort of their own homes.
2. Create a pregnancy support fund: Set up a crowdfunding campaign or a GoFundMe page to help the expectant mother cover any expenses related to her pregnancy, such as prenatal care, baby supplies, and other necessities.
3. Offer practical support: Offer to help the expectant mother with errands, grocery shopping, or household chores during her first trimester, when she may be feeling tired and overwhelmed.
4. Prepare a care package: Put together a bundle of items that can help the expectant mother during her pregnancy, such as comfortable clothing, pillows for support, or self-care items like bath bombs and essential oils.
5. Plan a fun outing: Plan a fun activity or outing with the expectant mother during her first trimester, such as a picnic in a nearby park or a visit to a local museum. This can help take her mind off of any discomfort or exhaustion she may be feeling.
6. Offer emotional support: Listen to the expectant mother's feelings and concerns, and offer words of encouragement and support. Remind her that she is not alone and that many women have gone through similar experiences.
7. Create a pregnancy journal: Create a journal or scrapbook where the expectant mother can track her pregnancy milestones, write down her thoughts and feelings, and include photos and mementos from her journey.
8. Plan a post-pregnancy celebration: After the baby is born, plan a celebration to mark the occasion and welcome the new addition to the family. This can include a baby shower, a brunch, or a small gathering with close friends and family.

Remember, every expectant mother's experience during her first trimester will be different, so it's important to tailor your support to
