As a radical democratic democrat beginner Chinese speaker, there are several challenges that you may face within the legal system in China. Here are some of the most common ones:

2. Cultural differences: The legal system in China is based on a different cultural context than what you may be used to in your home country. For example, the concept of "guanxi" (relationships) is very important in Chinese culture, and this can affect how the legal system operates and how cases are decided.
