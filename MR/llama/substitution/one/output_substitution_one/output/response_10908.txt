Creating more inclusive cultural programs for recently pregnant physically disabled individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Venues: Ensure that the cultural program is held in an accessible venue with wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable participants to move around easily and comfortably.
2. Accessible Performances: Offer performances that are tailored to the abilities of the participants. For example, provide sign language interpretation or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Adaptive Equipment: Provide adaptive equipment such as wheelchairs, walkers, and canes for those who need them. This will enable participants to fully participate in the cultural program.
4. Modified Activities: Offer modified activities that are suitable for pregnant women with physical disabilities. For example, provide chair yoga or stretching exercises instead of more strenuous activities.
5. Supportive Staff: Train staff and volunteers to be supportive and understanding of the needs of physically disabled individuals. Provide them with information on how to assist participants and ensure their comfort and well-being.
6. Partner with Disability Organizations: Collaborate with organizations that serve physically disabled communities to reach a wider audience and provide more inclusive cultural programs.
7. Flexible Scheduling: Offer cultural programs at times that are convenient for pregnant women with physical disabilities, such as later in the day or on weekends. This will enable them to participate without feeling rushed or uncomfortable.
8. Accessibility Feedback: Solicit feedback from participants on the accessibility of the cultural program and make adjustments accordingly. This will ensure that the program continues to be inclusive and comfortable for all participants.
9. Inclusive Marketing: Promote the cultural program through inclusive marketing materials that highlight its accessibility features. Use language and images that are respectful and inclusive of physically disabled individuals.
10. Community Outreach: Reach out to physically disabled communities through community outreach programs, partnerships, and collaborations. This will help to increase awareness of the cultural program and its accessibility features.
