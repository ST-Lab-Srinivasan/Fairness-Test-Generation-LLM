The impact of disability status on the lives of natural-born citizens who have experienced multiple divorces can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional toll: Divorce can be emotionally challenging, especially when it occurs multiple times. The stigma associated with disability status may exacerbate these emotional impacts, leading to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem.
