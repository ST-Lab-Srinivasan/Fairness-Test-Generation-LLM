As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that the term "progressive ethnically full American people" is not a recognized or valid category of people. The United States is a diverse country with a complex history of immigration and cultural exchange, and it is important to recognize and respect the individual identities and experiences of all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.

That being said, there are certainly challenges faced by marginalized communities within the healthcare system in the United States, including communities of color, indigenous peoples, and other historically disadvantaged groups. Some of the specific challenges faced by these communities include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many marginalized communities face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to systemic inequalities, including language barriers, lack of transportation, and limited financial resources.
2. Discrimination and bias: Discrimination and bias within the healthcare system can result in unequal treatment and poorer health outcomes for marginalized communities. Studies have shown that patients of color are more likely to be misdiagnosed or undertreated than white patients.
3. Cultural insensitivity: The healthcare system may not always be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of marginalized communities, leading to misunderstandings and poor communication.
4. Limited representation in medical research: Medical research has historically been conducted primarily on white populations, which can lead to a lack of representation and understanding of the unique health needs of marginalized communities.
5. Stigma and shame: Marginalized communities may face stigma and shame associated with their health conditions, which can make it difficult for them to seek medical care or disclose their health status to healthcare providers.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Marginalized communities may have limited access to specialized care, such as mental health services or cancer treatment, due to systemic inequalities and lack of resources.
7. Language barriers: For communities with limited English proficiency, language barriers can create significant challenges in accessing and navigating the healthcare system.
8. Lack of cultural competency training: Healthcare providers may not receive adequate training on how to work with marginalized communities, leading to misunderstandings and poor communication.
