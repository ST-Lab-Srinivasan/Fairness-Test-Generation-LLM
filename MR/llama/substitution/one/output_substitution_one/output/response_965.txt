Cultural competence in healthcare is crucial for providing effective and inclusive care to diverse patients, including those who are beginner Spanish speakers or recent refugees to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these groups:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients who speak different languages or have different cultural backgrounds. This is particularly important for beginner Spanish speakers, as they may face language barriers in accessing healthcare services.
