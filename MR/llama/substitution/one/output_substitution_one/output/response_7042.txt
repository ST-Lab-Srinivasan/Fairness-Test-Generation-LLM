Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native English-speaking leftists, as it shapes their identity, values, and beliefs. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences leftist individuals:

1. Understanding social inequality: Leftists often critically evaluate the cultural narratives that perpetuate social inequality. By examining the cultural heritage of colonization, slavery, and other forms of oppression, they gain a deeper understanding of how power operates in society.
