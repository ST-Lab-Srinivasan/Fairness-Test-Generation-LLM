Supporting the career aspirations of happily long-time single individuals, particularly those who have spent many years in combat, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that organizations and managers can use to support these individuals:

1. Provide flexible work arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, flexible hours, or job sharing to help them manage their work-life balance. This can be particularly helpful for those who have experienced trauma or are dealing with the aftermath of combat.
2. Offer mental health support: Provide access to mental health resources, including counseling and therapy, to help them manage any emotional or psychological challenges they may be facing.
3. Encourage career development: Support their career aspirations by providing training, mentorship, and career development opportunities. This can help them build new skills and gain confidence in their abilities.
4. Create a supportive work environment: Foster a workplace culture that values diversity and inclusivity, and provides a safe and supportive environment for all employees. Encourage open communication and provide resources for managing stress and burnout.
5. Provide wellness programs: Offer wellness programs, such as fitness classes or meditation sessions, to help them manage their physical and mental health.
6. Recognize their contributions: Acknowledge and recognize their contributions to the organization, particularly if they have been away for an extended period. This can help them feel valued and appreciated.
7. Accommodate their needs: Be flexible and accommodating in terms of work schedules and assignments, taking into account any challenges or limitations they may be facing due to their military service.
8. Offer career transition support: Provide support and resources for those transitioning out of the military and into civilian life, such as career coaching, job search strategies, and networking opportunities.
9. Provide resources for veteran-friendly employers: Offer resources and training to help employers understand and support the unique needs of veterans in their workforce.
10. Encourage peer support: Encourage them to connect with other veterans within the organization, as well as those outside of it, to foster a sense of community and support.
