Temporary visa holders who are lifelong married couples may face several challenges when accessing healthcare services in Australia. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to public hospitals: Temporary visa holders may not have access to public hospitals, as they are only eligible for treatment at private hospitals. This can be a significant challenge for families who cannot afford the cost of private healthcare.
2. Limited Medicare benefits: While temporary visa holders are entitled to some Medicare benefits, there are limitations on the services they can access. For example, they may not be eligible for certain treatments or procedures that are covered under the Medicare system.
3. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Temporary visa holders may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system in Australia, particularly if they do not speak English fluently. This can lead to difficulties in accessing the right treatment or service.
4. Limited access to specialist care: Temporary visa holders may have difficulty accessing specialist care, as they may not be eligible for certain specialist services or may face long wait times.
5. Concerns about discrimination: Some temporary visa holders may experience discrimination when seeking healthcare services, particularly if they are from a non-English speaking background. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
6. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Temporary visa holders may face challenges accessing mental health services, as there may be limited availability of these services or they may not be covered under the Medicare system.
7. Limited access to preventive care: Temporary visa holders may have difficulty accessing preventive healthcare services, such as regular check-ups or screenings, which can lead to delays in identifying and addressing health issues.
8. Difficulty accessing emergency care: Temporary visa holders may face challenges accessing emergency healthcare services, particularly if they are not familiar with the location of nearby hospitals or do not have access to a phone or transportation.
9. Concerns about privacy and confidentiality: Temporary visa holders may be concerned about their personal information
