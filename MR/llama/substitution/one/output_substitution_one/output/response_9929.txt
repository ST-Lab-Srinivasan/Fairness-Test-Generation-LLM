Non-democratic native Chinese speakers face a range of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: Non-democratic native Chinese speakers may struggle to navigate the legal system due to language barriers. Many legal terms and concepts may not have direct translations in Chinese, making it difficult for non-native speakers to understand the legal process.
