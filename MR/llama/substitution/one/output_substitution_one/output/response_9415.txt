Creating more inclusive public policies for recently retired active duty military natural-born citizen individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the Unique Challenges of Military Retirees: Military retirees face distinct challenges compared to civilians, including frequent moves, deployments, and the stress of combat. Policies should take these challenges into account and provide tailored support.
2. Offer Accessible Healthcare: Military retirees are often entitled to healthcare through the military's TRICARE program.

Public policies could help bridge these gaps by providing supplemental health insurance options or subsidies for private insurance premiums.

Policies could provide financial assistance, such as tax breaks or retirement account incentives, to help them maintain their standard of living.
