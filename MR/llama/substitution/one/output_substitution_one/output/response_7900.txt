Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-democratic native Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide language interpretation services, such as translation booths or mobile apps, in public spaces to ensure that everyone can access information and services. This can be particularly helpful for individuals who may not speak the dominant language of the region.
2. Culturally Sensitive Signage: Use culturally sensitive signage that takes into account the diverse cultural backgrounds of the community. For example, use images or symbols that are meaningful to different communities, such as a picture of a sun for Hispanic communities or a picture of a mountain for Indigenous communities.
3. Accessible Infrastructure: Ensure that public spaces have accessible infrastructure, such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms, to enable individuals with disabilities to fully participate in the space.
4. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that caters to the diverse needs and interests of the community. This can include cultural events, workshops, and activities that promote intergenerational dialogue and connection.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with local communities through outreach and consultation to ensure that public spaces are designed and maintained in a way that meets their needs and preferences. This can involve conducting surveys or focus groups with community members, as well as holding community meetings and workshops.
