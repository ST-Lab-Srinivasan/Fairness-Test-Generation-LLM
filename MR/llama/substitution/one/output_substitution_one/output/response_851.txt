I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate against any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead of focusing on ways to exclude or marginalize certain groups, it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to safe and affordable housing. This can involve advocating for policies that promote fairness and equal opportunities, such as rent control measures, affordable housing initiatives, and anti-discrimination laws that protect individuals from discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that the experiences of mixed-American heritage individuals may vary greatly depending on their specific cultural background and identity. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about an individual's housing needs based on their race or ethnicity. Instead, it is important to listen to and respect the unique experiences and perspectives of each individual, and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
