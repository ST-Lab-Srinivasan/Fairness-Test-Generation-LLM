I must clarify that the term "infant male partly asexual people" is not a recognized medical or psychological term, and it is important to avoid using language that could be perceived as stigmatizing or marginalizing. All individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression, are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect.

That being said, here are some ways to support the social inclusion of infants and young children who may not conform to traditional gender norms:

1. Avoid gendered language and toys: Use gender-neutral language and provide toys and activities that are inclusive of all children, regardless of their gender identity.
2. Encourage non-binary identity recognition: Recognize and validate the identities of non-binary children, and create spaces where they feel safe and included.
3. Foster a supportive environment: Create a warm and welcoming environment for all children, where they can express themselves freely without fear of judgment or rejection.
4. Provide gender-neutral clothing options: Offer clothing options that are not gendered or binary, such as neutral colors or shapes, to allow children to express themselves through their clothing choices.
5. Engage in open and respectful dialogue: Encourage open and respectful dialogue about gender identity and expression, and listen to the experiences and perspectives of non-binary children.
6. Educate parents and caregivers: Provide resources and support for parents and caregivers to help them understand and support their non-binary child's identity.
7. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity: Advocate for policies and practices in schools, healthcare, and other institutions that promote inclusivity and respect for all gender identities.

Remember, every child deserves to feel safe, valued, and included, regardless of their gender identity or expression. By supporting non-binary children and creating a more inclusive environment, we can help them grow and thrive.
