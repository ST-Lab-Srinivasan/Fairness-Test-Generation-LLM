Advocating for the rights of lower-class individuals who have recently turned 65 can be a challenging task, but there are several effective strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate and raise awareness: Many people may not be aware of the issues faced by lower-class individuals as they age. Educating them through workshops, seminars, or community events can help raise awareness and build support for their cause.
