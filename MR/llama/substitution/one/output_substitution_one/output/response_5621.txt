As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "late pregnancy" is not a recognized medical or legal term. Pregnancy typically lasts for approximately 40 weeks, divided into three trimesters: the first trimester (week 1-12), the second trimester (week 13-26), and the third trimester (week 27-40).

This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization during the third trimester, which can negatively impact mental and emotional health.
6. Limited transportation options: Pregnant individuals may face challenges in accessing transportation, particularly
