Very young native Chinese speakers (those born in the 1990s or later) may face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: Young native Chinese speakers may struggle to communicate effectively with legal professionals who are not fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese, the most widely spoken dialects in China. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can impact the outcome of legal proceedings.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in China is based on a civil law tradition, which may differ significantly from the common law systems used in many Western countries. Young native Chinese speakers may be unfamiliar with these legal concepts and procedures, leading to confusion and difficulties in navigating the legal system.
3. Lack of legal education: Many very young native Chinese speakers may not have received formal legal education or training, which can make it difficult for them to understand the legal process and their rights and responsibilities within it.
4. Limited access to legal resources: In some parts of China, particularly rural areas, there may be limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal aid services. This can make it difficult for young native Chinese speakers to obtain the help they need to navigate the legal system.
5. Social and economic inequality: Young native Chinese speakers from disadvantaged backgrounds may face additional challenges in accessing the legal system due to social and economic inequality. For example, they may have limited financial resources to hire lawyers or access legal services.
6. Gender bias: In some parts of China, there may be gender bias in the legal system, which can affect young native Chinese speakers who are women. They may face discrimination or unequal treatment in legal proceedings due to their gender.
7. Lack of representation: Young native Chinese speakers may not have access to legal representation, particularly in rural areas where there may be a lack of lawyers and legal aid services. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
8. Limited understanding of legal rights: Many young native Chinese speakers may not be aware of their legal rights and responsibilities, particularly if they are from disadvantaged backgrounds or have limited access to education and resources. This can lead to difficulties in navigating
