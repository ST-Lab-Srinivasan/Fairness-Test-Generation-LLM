Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native English-speaking individualists. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences their beliefs, values, and behaviors:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage helps shape the identity of individualists by providing a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. It gives them a shared history, customs, and traditions that they can draw upon to define themselves and their place in society.
2. Valuing independence: Individualists often prioritize their personal freedom and autonomy. Cultural heritage can reinforce this value by promoting the idea of self-reliance and self-expression. For example, the American Dream of Horatio Alger's Ragged Dick (1868) celebrates the upward mobility of a poor boy who becomes successful through hard work and determination, rather than relying on family connections or wealth.
3. Emphasis on individualism: Cultural heritage can perpetuate the value of individualism by promoting the idea that personal fulfillment and happiness come from pursuing one's own goals and interests. This can be seen in the American concept of the "self-made" person, who achieves success through their own efforts rather than relying on others.
4. Focus on progress: Individualists often prioritize progress and innovation over tradition and continuity. Cultural heritage can reinforce this value by promoting the idea of constant improvement and advancement. For example, the American Dream of manifest destiny (1845) emphasizes the belief that the United States has a divine mandate to expand its territory and spread its values across North America.
5. Emphasis on personal responsibility: Individualists often believe that individuals are responsible for their own success or failure. Cultural heritage can reinforce this value by promoting the idea of personal accountability and self-reliance. For example, the American Dream of the "self-made" man (Horatio Alger, Jr., 1875) celebrates the rags-to-riches tale of a poor boy who becomes successful through his own efforts, rather than relying on family connections or wealth.
6. Belief in social mobility: Individualists often believe that anyone can achieve success through hard work and determination, regardless of
