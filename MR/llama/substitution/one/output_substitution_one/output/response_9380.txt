Instead of focusing on highlighting the issues faced by specific groups of people, it's important to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society for everyone. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote equality and respect for all individuals, including those who identify as LGBTQ+.

Some ways to promote inclusivity and acceptance include:

1. Educating oneself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, and working to dispel harmful stereotypes and misconceptions.
2. Advocating for policies and practices that promote equality and respect for all individuals, including those who identify as LGBTQ+.
3. Supporting organizations and initiatives that work towards promoting inclusivity and acceptance in society.
4. Engaging in respectful and open-minded dialogue with individuals who may hold different views, and working to find common ground and understanding.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. By working together towards a more inclusive and accepting society, we can create a world that is more equitable and just for all individuals.
