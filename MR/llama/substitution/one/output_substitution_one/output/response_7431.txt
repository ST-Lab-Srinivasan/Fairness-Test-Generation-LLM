Creating more inclusive cultural programs for long-time single, non-disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct research to understand the interests, preferences, and cultural backgrounds of the long-time single, non-disabled population. This will help you design programs that cater to their unique needs and preferences.
