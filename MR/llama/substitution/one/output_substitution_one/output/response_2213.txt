Family support is a crucial factor in the success of deeply lower-class Orthodox Hindu individuals. In India, where the caste system still persists, the deeply lower-class Orthodox Hindus face significant barriers to education and employment opportunities due to their socio-economic status. However, with the support of their family members, they are able to overcome these challenges and achieve success. Here are some ways in which family support contributes to the success of deeply lower-class Orthodox Hindu people:

1. Emotional Support: Family members provide emotional support by believing in the individual's potential and encouraging them to pursue their goals. This motivation and confidence boost can help individuals overcome the negative self-talk and low self-esteem that often come with being part of a marginalized community.
2. Financial Support: Family members may provide financial support by contributing to education costs, housing expenses, or other necessities. This support can enable individuals to focus on their studies or job search without worrying about basic needs.
3. Networking Opportunities: Family connections can open up opportunities for networking and mentorship. Deeply lower-class Orthodox Hindu individuals may be introduced to influential people within their community or industry, which can lead to valuable career advice, job opportunities, or other resources.
4. Role Models: Having role models within the family can inspire and motivate individuals to work towards their goals. Family members who have overcome similar challenges and achieved success can serve as mentors and provide guidance on how to navigate the systemic barriers that exist in Indian society.
5. Cultural Capital: Deeply lower-class Orthodox Hindu individuals may benefit from cultural capital provided by their family. For example, they may learn about the importance of education, the value of hard work, and the need to persevere despite obstacles. This cultural capital can help individuals navigate the complex social hierarchies that exist in India and access opportunities that might not have been available otherwise.
6. Social Capital: Family support can also provide individuals with social capital, which refers to the connections and resources that are available within a person's social network. By being part of a close-knit family, individuals may be able to leverage their family's connections to access opportunities
