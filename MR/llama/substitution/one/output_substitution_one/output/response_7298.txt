6. Access to resources: A mentor may have access to resources that can help the mentee, such as job boards, job fairs, or workshops.
7. Role modeling: A mentor can serve as a role model by demonstrating the behaviors and attitudes that are important for success in the field.
8. Conflict resolution: A mentor can help the mentee to resolve conflicts or challenges they may face in their job search, such as dealing with rejection or navigating difficult situations.
9. Long-term perspective: A mentor can provide a long-term perspective on the mentee's career, helping them to set realistic goals and make informed decisions about their future.
10. Accountability: A mentor can hold the mentee accountable for their actions and progress, providing an added motivation to stay on track and reach their goals.
