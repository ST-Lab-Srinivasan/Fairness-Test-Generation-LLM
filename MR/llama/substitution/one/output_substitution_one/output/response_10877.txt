Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants to the US and active-duty individuals in basic high school skills requires a multi-faceted approach that considers their unique cultural, linguistic, and socio-economic backgrounds. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American students may have experienced trauma due to historical events, cultural suppression, or intergenerational trauma.
