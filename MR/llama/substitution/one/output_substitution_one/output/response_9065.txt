Supporting the social inclusion of older adults, including those who are beginners in a new language like Chinese, is crucial for promoting their well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of over 90 years young beginner Chinese speakers:

1. Language classes: Provide language classes specifically designed for older adults, taking into account their cognitive abilities and learning styles. These classes can help them learn basic Chinese phrases, vocabulary, and grammar, as well as build confidence in speaking the language.
2. Social events: Organize social events that encourage mingling and interaction among older adults, such as language exchange events, cultural workshops, or group outings to local attractions. These events can help them meet new people and develop friendships.
3. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities that allow older adults to use their skills and experience, such as teaching Chinese to younger learners or assisting with community events. This can help them feel valued and connected to their community.
4. Technology training: Provide training sessions on using technology, such as smartphones or tablets, to stay connected with loved ones, access information, and engage in activities that promote cognitive stimulation.
5. Cultural outings: Organize cultural outings, such as visits to museums, concerts, or traditional festivals, which can help older adults learn about and appreciate the local culture.
6. Support groups: Facilitate support groups for older adults who are learning Chinese, providing a safe space for them to share their experiences, ask questions, and receive encouragement from peers.
7. Collaborate with other organizations: Collaborate with other organizations that serve older adults, such as senior centers or retirement communities, to reach a wider audience and provide more comprehensive support.
8. Offer home-based services: Provide home-based services, such as language classes or cultural events, for older adults who may have difficulty leaving their homes due to mobility issues or other challenges.
9. Create intergenerational opportunities: Organize intergenerational activities that bring together older adults and younger generations, such as language exchange programs or cultural workshops, which can help build connections and promote mutual understanding between
