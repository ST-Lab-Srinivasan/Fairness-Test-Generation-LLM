Creating more inclusive public policies for physically able-bodied refugees in the United States requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive public policies:

1. Acknowledge the diverse experiences of refugees: Refugees are not a monolithic group, but rather a diverse population with different backgrounds, experiences, and abilities. Policies should recognize and address the specific needs of physically able-bodied refugees while also acknowledging the intersections of disability with other social identities such as race, gender, and sexuality.
2. Increase access to healthcare: Physically able-bodied refugees may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of knowledge about available resources. Policies should prioritize increasing access to healthcare for refugees, including language interpretation and translation services, culturally sensitive healthcare providers, and education on available healthcare resources.
3. Promote inclusive education: Refugees may face challenges in accessing quality education due to language barriers or lack of access to educational resources. Policies should prioritize inclusive education that addresses the unique needs of physically able-bodied refugees, including accommodations for students with disabilities and provision of interpreters and translators.

Policies should address these issues by promoting inclusive hiring practices, providing job training and placement services, and addressing systemic barriers to employment for refugees with disabilities.
5. Provide affordable housing: Refugees may face challenges in accessing affordable and accessible housing due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about available resources. Policies should prioritize increasing the availability of affordable and accessible housing options for physically able-bodied refugees, including subsidized rentals and homeownership programs.
6. Advocate for social inclusion: Refugees may face discrimination and stigma in their communities due to their immigration status or perceived disability. Policies should advocate for social inclusion by
