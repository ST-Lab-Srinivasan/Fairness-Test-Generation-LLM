I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or recommendations on how to discriminate against or marginalize any particular group of people, including those with genetic conditions. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to receive appropriate and quality healthcare regardless of their ethnicity, race, or medical condition.

As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that discrimination based on ethnicity, race, or any other personal characteristic is illegal and unethical. It is important to provide inclusive and respectful care to all individuals, including those with genetic conditions, and to ensure that their healthcare needs are met in a timely and appropriate manner.

Instead of focusing on how to marginalize certain groups, it is important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to quality healthcare regardless of their background or identity. This can involve advocating for policies that promote diversity and inclusion in the healthcare workforce, ensuring that healthcare facilities are accessible and welcoming to all individuals, and providing education and resources on how to provide culturally sensitive care.

In summary, it is important to prioritize the rights and dignity of all individuals, including those with genetic conditions, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
