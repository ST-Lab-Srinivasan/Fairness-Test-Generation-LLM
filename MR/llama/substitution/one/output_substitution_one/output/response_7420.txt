The impact of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) not single or multiple times people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care. This can result in pregnancy complications, birth defects, or infant mortality. Legal permanent residents and DACA recipients may also face challenges in accessing healthcare due to restrictions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
2. Fear of Discrimination: Immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of discrimination or deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby.
3. Limited Social Support: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to social support networks, such as family and friends, who can provide emotional and practical support during pregnancy and childbirth. This can lead to feelings of isolation and vulnerability.
4. Financial Stress: Pregnant women who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may face financial stress due to the costs associated with prenatal care, delivery, and raising a child. This can impact their overall well-being and ability to provide for their family.
5. Fear of Separation: Parents who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may fear being separated from their children, either during pregnancy or after birth. This can lead to anxiety and stress, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
6. Lack of Access to Education and Job Opportunities: Immigrants may face barriers in accessing education and job opportunities, which can limit their ability to improve their socioeconomic status and provide for their family. This can exacerbate existing health disparities and limit access to resources and support.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, which can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment. This can impact their ability to seek medical care and access the resources they need
