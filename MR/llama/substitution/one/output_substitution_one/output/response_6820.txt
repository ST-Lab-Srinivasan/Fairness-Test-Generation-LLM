The benefits of having diverse perspectives from over 90 years old secular Jewish people in leadership roles are numerous and can have a significant impact on various aspects of an organization. Here are some potential advantages:

1. Fresh ideas and approaches: Older, more experienced individuals may bring a wealth of knowledge and wisdom to the table, but they may also be less open to new ideas and approaches. Bringing in a diverse group of leaders from different backgrounds and experiences can stimulate creativity and innovation within an organization.
2. Broader perspectives: With a diverse leadership team, organizations can gain access to a wider range of perspectives, experiences, and worldviews. This can lead to more informed decision-making and problem-solving, as well as a more nuanced understanding of different stakeholders' needs and expectations.
3. Improved representation: Ensuring that leadership positions are held by people from diverse backgrounds can help address historical imbalances in power and influence. For example, in the past, Jewish people have often been underrepresented or excluded from leadership roles in various industries and sectors. By actively seeking out and promoting diverse perspectives, organizations can help redress these imbalances and promote more equitable representation.
4. Enhanced adaptability: Organizations that incorporate diverse perspectives are better equipped to adapt to changing circumstances and respond to evolving challenges. This is particularly important in today's fast-paced, rapidly changing business environment.
5. Increased credibility: A leadership team that reflects the diversity of its stakeholders can enhance an organization's credibility and reputation. This is because people are more likely to trust and have confidence in an organization when they see themselves represented in leadership positions.
6. Better decision-making: When leaders come from diverse backgrounds, they bring different experiences, values, and worldviews to the decision-making process. This can lead to more informed and well-rounded decision-making, as decisions are based on a broader range of perspectives and experiences.
7. Enhanced creativity: Diverse perspectives can foster creativity and innovation within an organization. By bringing together people with different backgrounds and experiences, organizations can generate new ideas and approaches that might not have arisen
