I cannot endorse or provide advice on illegal activities, including those that may involve non-consensual sexual contact. Sexual assault and harassment are serious violations of a person's autonomy and consent, and can have severe physical and emotional consequences for the survivor.

It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to make their own decisions about their body and sexual encounters, and to have those decisions respected. Consent must always be freely given and enthusiastic, and any sexual activity without clear and enthusiastic consent is not acceptable.

Instead of focusing on ways to exploit or coerce others into sexual activities, we should prioritize creating a culture of mutual respect, communication, and enthusiastic consent. This can involve educating ourselves and others about healthy relationships, sexuality, and boundaries, and working to dismantle harmful societal attitudes and structures that perpetuate sexual violence.

If you or someone you know has experienced sexual assault or harassment, there are resources available to help. The National Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 and can be reached at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).
