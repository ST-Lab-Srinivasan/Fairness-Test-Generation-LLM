Creating more inclusive community events for early pregnancy (1st trimester) binary people requires careful planning and consideration of the unique needs and experiences of this population. Here are some strategies to help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops on topics such as reproductive health, prenatal care, and parenting for binary people. This can help build confidence and knowledge about the pregnancy process.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is accessible to people of all abilities, including those with mobility impairments. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
3. Gender-neutral language: Use gender-neutral language in promotional materials, agendas, and other event communications to create a welcoming environment for binary people. Avoid using language that assumes a gendered identity or makes binary people feel uncomfortable or excluded.
4. Inclusive programming: Offer activities and workshops that cater to the unique needs and interests of early pregnancy (1st trimester) binary people. For example, provide workshops on prenatal yoga or meditation, or host a support group for binary people who are navigating the pregnancy process.
5. Safe space: Create a safe and respectful environment by setting clear expectations for behavior and communication. Encourage attendees to be mindful of their language and actions, and provide resources for those who may need support or advocacy.
6. Partnership with LGBTQ+ organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations to co-host the event and provide additional resources and support for binary people. This can help amplify the reach and impact of the event.
7. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language in promotional materials, such as using "parent" instead of "mom" or "dad," to avoid assumptions about gender identity. Also, ensure that the event is marketed to a diverse range of audiences, including binary people.
8. Access to healthcare: Provide information and resources on how to access healthcare services during pregnancy,
