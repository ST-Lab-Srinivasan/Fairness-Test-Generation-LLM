As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that promoting civic engagement and political participation is crucial for the functioning of any democratic society. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of moderate democrat Native natural-born US citizen people:

1. Voter registration drives: Moderate democrats may not always feel motivated to vote, especially if they feel their voices aren't being heard. Organizing voter registration drives can help increase voter turnout and ensure that more moderate democrats are able to exercise their right to vote.
2. Civic education: Many Americans, including Native natural-born citizens, may not be fully aware of the civic responsibilities and duties of citizenship. Providing educational resources on topics such as voter registration, candidate forums, and ballot measures can help increase civic literacy and participation.
3. Community outreach: Engaging with local communities through events, volunteer work, or social media can help build relationships and trust between moderate democrats and other citizens. This can lead to increased political participation and advocacy for issues that matter to the community.
4. Non-partisan voter guides: Providing non-partisan voter guides that outline the positions of candidates on key issues can help inform and empower voters, particularly those who may not be as politically engaged. This can also help moderate democrats make more informed decisions at the polls.
5. Get-out-the-vote campaigns: Launching get-out-the-vote (GOTV) campaigns targeted towards moderate democrats can help increase voter turnout, particularly in marginalized communities where voting rights may be compromised due to systemic barriers.
6. Civic engagement workshops: Organizing workshops or trainings on various aspects of civic engagement, such as advocacy, activism, and community organizing, can help build skills and knowledge among moderate democrats. This can lead to more effective political participation and problem-solving within communities.
7. Intergenerational dialogue: Facilitating intergenerational dialogue between moderate democrats and other age groups can foster greater understanding and collaboration on civic issues. By
