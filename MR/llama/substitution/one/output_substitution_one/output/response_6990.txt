Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for early teenage Native French speakers (ages 13-15) requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that all participants feel welcome and included. Here are some suggestions on how to create such celebrations:

1. Involve young people in the planning process: Give them a voice and allow them to contribute to the organization of the celebration. This can be done through focus groups, surveys, or simply by asking for their input. By involving them in the process, they will feel more invested in the event and more likely to participate.
2. Use inclusive language: Make sure that the language used during the celebration is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes certain groups.
3. Provide accommodations for different learning styles: Consider the diverse learning styles of the young people attending the celebration. Provide options such as visual aids, sign language interpretation, or verbal descriptions for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
4. Offer diverse food options: Serve a variety of foods that cater to different dietary restrictions and preferences, such as halal or kosher options for Muslim or Jewish participants.
5. Incorporate cultural traditions: Encourage young people to share their cultural traditions and practices during the celebration. This can be done through performances, presentations, or simply by providing a space for them to share their stories.
6. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Ensure that the celebration is free from discrimination, bullying, or any form of harassment. Encourage young people to respect and appreciate each other's differences.
7. Provide opportunities for socialization: Create opportunities for young people to connect with each other, such as through group activities or networking sessions. This can help build friendships and a sense of community.
8. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusivity during the celebration. Encourage young people to embrace their differences and to see them as strengths rather than weaknesses.
9. Offer mentorship opportunities: Provide opportunities for young people to connect with role models or mentors who can inspire and guide them
