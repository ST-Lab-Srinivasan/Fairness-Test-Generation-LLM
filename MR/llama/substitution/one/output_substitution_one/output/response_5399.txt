Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Hindu individuals who are not wealthy or multimillionaires requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Make cultural programs accessible: Offer free or low-cost admission to cultural events, such as festivals, concerts, and workshops. This can be done by partnering with local organizations or businesses to secure funding or venues.
2. Provide financial assistance: Offer scholarships or financial aid to individuals who cannot afford the costs associated with cultural programs. This can include tuition fees, transportation costs, and admission prices.
3. Promote cultural education: Develop educational resources and workshops that teach the history and significance of Hindu culture and traditions. These resources can be made available online or in-person at community centers or libraries.
4. Encourage diversity and inclusion: Ensure that cultural programs are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives and stories into cultural events and programming.
5. Foster cross-cultural exchange: Organize cultural events and workshops that bring together individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can help promote mutual understanding, respect, and appreciation for each other's traditions and beliefs.
6. Provide opportunities for community engagement: Create opportunities for individuals to participate in cultural programs and activities, such as volunteering at festivals or workshops, or leading cultural events. This can help build a sense of community and belonging among participants.
7. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms and social media to reach a wider audience and make cultural programming more accessible. This can include streaming cultural events online, creating virtual exhibitions, or using social media to promote cultural programs and activities.
8. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations, such as community centers, libraries, and schools, to co-host cultural events and activities. This can help reach a wider audience and make cultural programming more inclusive.
9. Offer tailored programming: Develop cultural programs that cater to the specific needs and interests of secular Hindu individuals. For example, offering workshops on Hindu mythology or philosophy can be an effective way to engage this demographic
