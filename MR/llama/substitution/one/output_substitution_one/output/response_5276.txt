Creating more inclusive housing policies for recently pregnant women, particularly those in their third trimester, requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive housing policies:

1. Accommodate Pregnancy: Housing providers should recognize that pregnancy is a temporary medical condition and accommodate the needs of recently pregnant women. This can include providing modified living spaces, such as larger bedrooms or extra storage space for baby supplies, and ensuring that building entryways and hallways are wide enough to accommodate strollers.
2. Prioritize Accessibility: Ensure that all housing facilities, including elevators, bathrooms, and kitchens, are accessible and adaptable for pregnant women and those with disabilities. This can include installing grab bars in bathrooms, widening doorways, and using easy-to-clean surfaces.
3. Flexible Leasing Options: Offer flexible leasing options to accommodate the changing needs of pregnant women. For example, consider offering short-term leases or allowing women to pause their lease payments during their pregnancy and breastfeeding period.
4. Breastfeeding Support: Provide designated breastfeeding areas or allow breastfeeding in common spaces, such as living rooms or outdoor areas. Ensure that these areas are clean, comfortable, and private for mothers.
5. Childcare Resources: Offer resources and support for parents, including on-site childcare services, referrals to local daycares, or access to parenting classes. This can help reduce stress and financial burdens on parents during this time.
6. Community Outreach: Engage with the local community and healthcare providers to raise awareness about the needs of pregnant women and new mothers. This can include hosting workshops or events focused on prenatal care, breastfeeding, and parenting.
7. Inclusive Marketing: Ensure that marketing materials and website content are inclusive and welcoming to pregnant women and families. Avoid using language or imagery that may be off-putting or alienating.
8. Support Services: Offer additional support services, such as home cleaning and organization, meal preparation, or errand running
