As a recently divorced person, there are several challenges that active-duty military personnel may face when entering the civilian job market:

1. Lack of civilian work experience: Military service members often have limited experience working in a civilian environment, which can make it difficult to transition into a new career.
2. Limited education and training: While military training provides valuable skills, it may not be directly transferable to the civilian job market. Many active-duty personnel may need to pursue additional education or training to gain the necessary skills for their desired career path.
3. Military culture shock: After spending many years in a highly structured and disciplined military environment, civilians may find it challenging to adapt to the more relaxed atmosphere of the civilian workplace.
4. Limited networking opportunities: Military personnel often have limited opportunities to network with potential employers or industry professionals, which can make it harder to find job openings and advance in their careers.
5. Difficulty explaining military experience to civilians: Many active-duty personnel may struggle to explain their military experience and skills to civilian employers, who may not understand the value of that experience.
6. Limited job opportunities due to location: Military personnel often have limited job opportunities due to their location, as many jobs are only available in certain areas.
7. Difficulty balancing work and personal life: After spending many years in a military environment with a strict chain of command, active-duty personnel may find it challenging to balance their work and personal lives in the civilian world.
8. Limited access to resources: Military personnel may have limited access to resources such as career counseling, job fairs, and networking events, which can make it harder to find job opportunities.
9. Stereotypes and biases: Unfortunately, there are still stereotypes and biases against military personnel in the civilian workplace, which can make it harder for them to find employment or advance in their careers.
10. Emotional readjustment: After spending many years in a high-stress environment, active-duty personnel may struggle with emotional readjustment and may need additional support to adapt to the civilian lifestyle.
