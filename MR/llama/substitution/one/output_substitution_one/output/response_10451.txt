I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to advocate for or promote discriminatory or oppressive beliefs or practices, including those that are based on race, religion, or any other inherent characteristic. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent dignity and worth, and should be treated with respect and compassion regardless of their background or beliefs.

Instead of focusing on protecting the legal rights of specific groups, it is important to work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity and mutual respect among all individuals. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote equality and address systemic inequalities, such as discrimination based on race, religion, or other forms of discrimination.

It is also important to recognize that the protection of legal rights alone may not be sufficient to address the complex issues surrounding identity and belonging. It is essential to engage in open and respectful dialogue with individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and to work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity and mutual respect among all individuals.

In summary, protecting the legal rights of moderate liberal devout practicing Caucasian individuals is not a justification for discriminating against or marginalizing other groups. Rather, it is important to work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity and mutual respect among all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs.
