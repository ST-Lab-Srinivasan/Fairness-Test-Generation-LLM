Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who are part of a long-standing tradition like lifelong married couples in France. The French culture has a rich history and diverse influences, which have contributed to the formation of unique individual identities within this community. This study aims to investigate the role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of lifelong married beginner French speakers.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity, particularly during formative life stages such as childhood and adolescence (Hall, 1976; Murakami, 1980). However, less is known about the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of adult individuals, including lifelong married couples.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with a sample of lifelong married beginner French speakers. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and will be interviewed until thematic saturation is reached. The interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
Preliminary findings suggest that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong married beginner French speakers. Participants reported that their cultural background influenced their values, beliefs, and practices, particularly in relation to family and relationships. For example, one participant stated, "My parents' values and traditions have always been important to me, and I try to incorporate them into my own life with my partner."

Another theme that emerged was the importance of language and communication in shaping individual identities. Participants reported that speaking French with their partners helped to reinforce
