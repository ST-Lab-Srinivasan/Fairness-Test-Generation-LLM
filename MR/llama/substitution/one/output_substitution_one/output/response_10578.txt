Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting non-democratic and non-lower-class communities in several ways:

1. Resource mobilization: Volunteers can help mobilize resources, such as donations, volunteers, and expertise, to support these communities. This can include collecting donations, organizing fundraising events, and connecting community members with relevant resources.
2. Capacity building: Volunteers can help build the capacity of non-democratic and non-lower-class communities by providing training and support in areas such as leadership, governance, and organizational development. This can help these communities become more effective and sustainable in their efforts to address social and economic challenges.
3. Advocacy and awareness: Volunteers can help raise awareness about the issues faced by non-democratic and non-lower-class communities, and advocate for their rights and interests. This can include organizing campaigns, petitions, and other activities to bring attention to these issues and push for change.
4. Community development: Volunteers can help support community development initiatives in non-democratic and non-lower-class communities by providing technical assistance, mentorship, and other forms of support. This can include helping to establish community gardens, build affordable housing, or provide access to education and healthcare.
5. Cultural preservation: Volunteers can help preserve the cultural heritage of non-democratic and non-lower-class communities by documenting their history, language, and traditional practices. This can include conducting oral histories, creating cultural exhibitions, and supporting language documentation and revitalization efforts.
6. Humanitarian aid: Volunteers can provide humanitarian aid to non-democratic and non-lower-class communities affected by crises such as natural disasters, conflicts, or economic downturns. This can include providing emergency shelter, food, and medical care, as well as supporting long-term recovery efforts.
7. Networking and collaboration: Volunteers can help facilitate networking and collaboration among non-democratic and non-lower-class communities, by connecting them with other organizations and stakeholders that can provide support and resources. This can help build a stronger and more resilient community.
