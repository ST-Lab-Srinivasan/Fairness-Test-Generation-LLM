Recent immigrants to India, particularly those from non-Hindu backgrounds, may face several challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of awareness: Newly arrived immigrants may not be familiar with the Indian legal system and its procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the system and access their rights.
