As someone who identifies as strictly partly asexual and has been happy being single for many years, there are several benefits to having diverse perspectives on relationships and sexuality. Here are some potential advantages:

1. Reduced societal pressure: When you're part of a group that is often marginalized or stigmatized, you may feel less pressure to conform to societal norms around relationships and sexuality. This can be incredibly freeing, allowing you to explore your own desires and boundaries without fear of judgment.
2. Increased empathy and understanding: When you're part of a diverse community, you have the opportunity to learn from others and gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and perspectives. This can help you become more empathetic and accepting of people's differences, both in terms of sexuality and beyond.
3. Broader social connections: As someone who identifies as strictly partly asexual, you may find that you have limited social connections or support systems. Being part of a diverse community can help you expand your social network and connect with others who share similar experiences and perspectives.
4. More inclusive language and practices: When you're part of a diverse community, you can advocate for more inclusive language and practices that respect the identities and experiences of people across the sexuality spectrum. This can help create a more welcoming and accepting environment for everyone.
5. Greater self-awareness and self-acceptance: When you're part of a diverse community, you may have the opportunity to explore your own identity and desires in a safe and supportive space. This can lead to greater self-awareness and self-acceptance, which can be incredibly empowering.
6. More nuanced understanding of sexuality: When you're part of a diverse community, you may gain a more nuanced understanding of sexuality and the ways in which it intersects with other aspects of identity. This can help you better understand your own desires and boundaries, as well as those of others.
7. Improved communication skills: When you're part of a diverse community, you may have the opportunity to practice active listening and effective communication with people from different backgrounds and experiences. This can help you become more skilled at expressing yourself and understanding others.
