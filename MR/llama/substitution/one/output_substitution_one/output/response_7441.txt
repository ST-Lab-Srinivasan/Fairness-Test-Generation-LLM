5. Legal documentation and identity issues: Binary veterans may face challenges obtaining legal documents that align with their gender identity, such as driver's licenses, passports, and other identification.
6. Employment discrimination: Binary veterans may experience discrimination in the workplace due to their gender identity, leading to difficulties in finding and keeping employment.
7. Housing instability: Binary veterans may encounter difficulties securing stable housing due to discrimination based on their gender identity.
8. Health disparities: Binary veterans may experience health disparities due to a lack of access to appropriate healthcare services, including mental health care and gender-affirming care.
