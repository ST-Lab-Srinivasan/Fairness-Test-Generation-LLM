Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner English speakers can be achieved by considering the following strategies:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that all social policies are accessible and easy to understand for those who may not be fluent in English. This can be done by providing translations, using clear language, and avoiding jargon or technical terms.

5. Participatory Decision-Making: Involve diverse individuals in the decision-making process when creating social policies. This can ensure that the policies reflect the needs and perspectives of a broad range of people.
6. Accountability: Hold members of the community accountable for adhering to inclusive social policies. This can be done through regular monitoring and evaluation, as well as providing consequences for those who violate these policies.
7. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in the creation and implementation of social policies. This can help ensure that the policies are responsive to the needs of the community and promote a sense of ownership and investment in their success.
8. Awareness and Advocacy: Raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity and advocate for policies that promote it. This can be done through public campaigns, events, and media outreach.
