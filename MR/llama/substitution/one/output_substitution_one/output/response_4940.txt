There are several ways to support the economic empowerment of low-income or recent refugee individuals in the United States:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many refugees and low-income individuals lack access to basic banking services, such as checking and savings accounts, due to a lack of financial infrastructure in their home countries or discrimination in the US. Organizations like the Global Economic Exchange (GEE) are working to provide these services through mobile banking platforms.
2. Job Training and Placement: Many refugees face significant barriers to finding employment in the US, including a lack of job skills and language barriers. Programs like the International Rescue Committee's (IRC) Workforce Development program provide job training and placement services to help refugees find stable employment.
3. Entrepreneurship Support: Refugees often have entrepreneurial aspirations, but lack access to capital, networks, and other resources to start their own businesses. Organizations like the IRC's Business & Entrepreneurship program provide training and support for refugee entrepreneurs.

These loans can help individuals start or grow their own businesses, improve their living conditions, and achieve greater economic stability.
