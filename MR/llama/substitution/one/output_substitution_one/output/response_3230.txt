To ensure that the educational needs of very young Native English speaker students (ages 90+), it's essential to provide a nurturing and stimulating learning environment that promotes cognitive, social, and emotional development. Here are some strategies to meet their educational needs:

1. Age-appropriate curriculum: Develop a curriculum that is tailored to the unique needs of this age group. Incorporate hands-on activities, play-based learning, and opportunities for self-directed exploration.
2. Individualized instruction: Recognize that each child's developmental pace is different. Provide one-on-one instruction or small group settings to cater to their individual needs and abilities.
3. Developmentally appropriate assessments: Use age-appropriate assessments to evaluate the students' cognitive, social, and emotional development. This will help identify areas where they may need additional support or enrichment.
4. Language immersion: Provide a language immersion program that incorporates English as the primary language of instruction. This can help native English speakers develop fluency and comprehension in their native language.
5. Cultural responsiveness: Ensure that the educational environment is culturally responsive, recognizing the students' cultural backgrounds and experiences. Incorporate diverse perspectives and representations in curriculum materials and teaching practices.
6. Parent-teacher collaboration: Encourage regular communication and collaboration between parents and teachers to better understand each child's needs and progress. This can help identify potential areas of concern and inform instructional decisions.
7. Social-emotional learning: Incorporate social-emotional learning activities into the curriculum, focusing on developing skills such as empathy, self-awareness, and self-regulation. These skills are essential for young children to navigate their social environments successfully.
8. Sensory integration: Provide opportunities for sensory integration through hands-on activities, arts, and crafts. This can help these students process and make sense of their sensory experiences.
9. Technology integration: Introduce technology-based learning tools and resources that cater to the students' age and skill level. This can help enhance their engagement and motivation in the learning process.
