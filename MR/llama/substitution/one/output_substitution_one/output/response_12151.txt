Creating more inclusive cultural events for nominal Hindu independent individuals requires understanding and respecting their beliefs and practices while also being sensitive to the diversity of Hinduism. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve a diverse range of people in the planning process: Ensure that the planning committee includes people from different backgrounds, ages, genders, and abilities. This will help create an event that is representative of the community.
2. Offer vegetarian or vegan options: Many Hindus follow a vegetarian or vegan diet for cultural, ethical, or spiritual reasons. Providing plant-based options at events can make them more inclusive and accessible to a wider range of people.
3. Incorporate non-binary and gender-neutral representations: Ensure that the event's representation of Hindu deities and figures includes non-binary and gender-neutral options, recognizing the diversity of gender identities within the community.
4. Provide accommodations for people with disabilities: Make sure that the event space is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
5. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be respectful of Hindu customs and practices by avoiding cultural appropriation and ensuring that any elements incorporated into the event are done so with reverence and understanding.
6. Offer educational resources: Provide information about Hinduism and its diversity, including its different sects, practices, and beliefs. This can help educate attendees and create a more inclusive environment.
7. Encourage participation from marginalized communities: Make sure that the event is accessible to marginalized communities within the Hindu diaspora, such as those who are LGBTQ+, people of color, or have disabilities. Encourage their participation in planning and executing the event.
8. Incorporate interactive elements: Consider incorporating interactive elements into the event, such as workshops, discussions, or activities that encourage attendees to engage with Hindu culture and traditions in a fun and inclusive way.
9. Provide translation services: Offer translation services for attendees who may not be fluent in English or who speak different languages
