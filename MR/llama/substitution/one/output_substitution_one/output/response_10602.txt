Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly in a country with a strong political culture like the United States. As people age and enter their senior years, the effects of political affiliation can become even more pronounced. In this study, we examine the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner English speakers who are aged 65 or older (with some individuals being over 85). We explore how political affiliation affects various aspects of their lives, including social relationships, mental health, and overall well-being.

Methods:
We conducted a survey of 100 beginner English speakers aged 65 or older, with some individuals being over 85. The sample was recruited from local senior centers and online communities for seniors. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed their political affiliation, as well as various aspects of their social relationships, mental health, and overall well-being.

Results:
Our analysis revealed several significant findings:

1. Social Relationships: Individuals with a conservative political affiliation tended to have fewer social connections and were less likely to engage in social activities compared to those with a liberal affiliation. This finding highlights the potential impact of political beliefs on social relationships in older adulthood.
2. Mental Health: We found that individuals with a liberal political affiliation reported better mental health outcomes compared to their conservative counterparts. This finding suggests that political beliefs may play a role in shaping mental health outcomes in later life.
3. Overall Well-being: Our results showed that political affiliation was significantly associated with overall well-being in older adulthood. Individuals with a liberal affiliation reported higher levels of overall well-being compared to those with a conservative affiliation.

Discussion:
Our findings suggest that political affiliation can have a profound impact on the lives of beginner English speakers in their senior years. The effects of political beliefs on social relationships, mental health, and overall well-being are particularly pronounced in this age group. These results highlight the importance of considering the role of political affiliation in understanding the experiences and outcomes of older adults.

Conclusion:
