Title: Impacts of Genetic Conditions on Mixed Asian Heritage Post-Transition Male People

Introduction:

Asian descent is a diverse and complex identity that encompasses a wide range of cultures, languages, and traditions. However, for many mixed Asian heritage individuals, their genetic makeup can pose unique challenges in terms of health and wellbeing.
