Ensuring that the financial needs of recently arrived refugees in the US are met can be a complex and multi-faceted process. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented:

1. Provide access to financial assistance programs: There are several government and non-profit programs that provide financial assistance to refugees, including the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and the International Rescue Committee (IRC).
