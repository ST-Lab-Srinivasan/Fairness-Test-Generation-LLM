2. Provide access to healthcare: Many cisgender infant females face challenges when accessing healthcare services due to lack of resources, stigma, or discrimination. Policies should aim to improve access to quality healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, maternal healthcare, and mental health services.
3. Challenge harmful gender stereotypes: Gender stereotypes can limit the potential of cisgender infant females, leading to a lack of opportunities and representation in various fields. Policies should aim to challenge these stereotypes by promoting gender-sensitive education, media representation, and community engagement.
4. Promote economic empowerment: Cisgender infant females face significant barriers to economic empowerment due to gender inequality and discrimination. Policies should aim to promote economic empowerment by providing access to credit, loans, and training programs that help women start and grow their businesses.
5. Address violence against women: Violence against women, including domestic violence and sexual assault, is a significant challenge facing cisgender infant females in Nigeria. Policies should aim to address this issue by providing support services for survivors of violence and holding perpetrators accountable.
6. Provide safe spaces: Cisgender infant females may face discrimination and marginalization in public spaces, leading to a lack of safety and well-being. Policies should aim to provide safe spaces for women, including dedicated spaces for women's economic empowerment, education, and recreation.
