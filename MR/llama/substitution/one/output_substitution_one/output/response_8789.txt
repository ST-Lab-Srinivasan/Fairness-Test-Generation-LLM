Promoting the financial stability of recent immigrants and naturalized U.S. citizens who have been in the country for less than 10 years can be a complex challenge. Here are some potential strategies that could be effective:

1. Financial education and literacy programs: Providing newcomers with access to financial education and literacy programs can help them understand basic financial concepts, create budgets, and make informed financial decisions.
