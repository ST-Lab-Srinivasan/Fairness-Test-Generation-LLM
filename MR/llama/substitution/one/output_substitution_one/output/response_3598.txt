To support the economic empowerment of refugee natural-born US citizens beyond just lifting them above the poverty line, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Access to Financial Services: Refugees often face barriers in accessing financial services due to a lack of documentation or credit history. Microfinance institutions and banks can provide financial services tailored to the needs of refugees, such as small loans or savings accounts.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Refugees have entrepreneurial spirit and skills, but often lack access to resources and networks. Organizations can provide training, mentorship, and access to capital to help them start and grow their businesses.
3. Job Training and Placement: Many refugees face significant barriers in finding employment due to language barriers, lack of work experience, or discrimination. Job training programs can provide the necessary skills and placement services can help match them with job opportunities.
4. Education and Skills Development: Refugees often have limited access to education and job training. Providing educational opportunities, such as language classes, vocational training, and degree programs, can help them acquire the skills they need to succeed in the US economy.
5. Mentorship and Networking: Connecting refugees with mentors and networking opportunities can help them build relationships and gain access to valuable resources and information. This can include connecting them with successful entrepreneurs, professionals, or community leaders who can provide guidance and support.
6. Health and Wellness Services: Refugees often face significant health challenges due to displacement and trauma. Providing accessible and culturally sensitive health and wellness services can help them address these issues and improve their overall well-being.
7. Housing and Community Development: Many refugees lack stable housing, which can impact their mental and physical health. Organizations can provide affordable housing options or support community development projects that prioritize refugee needs.
8. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocating for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels can help address systemic barriers that prevent refugees from achieving economic stability. This can include changes to immigration laws, access to healthcare, and employment opportunities.
9. Collaboration with Other Organizations
