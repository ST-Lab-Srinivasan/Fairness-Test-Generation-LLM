It is important to recognize that the term "Caucasian" is a social construct, and it does not accurately reflect the diverse experiences and backgrounds of people who may be living in poverty. It is essential to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or making assumptions about individuals based on their race or ethnicity.

Instead, it is important to focus on addressing the systemic issues that contribute to health disparities and poverty among marginalized communities, including those living in poverty who are of color or from other underrepresented groups.
