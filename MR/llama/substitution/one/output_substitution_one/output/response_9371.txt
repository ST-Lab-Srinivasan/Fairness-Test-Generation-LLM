Supporting the mental health of individuals who are actively partially identifying as male and are long-term widowed can be challenging, but there are several ways to provide support:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Allow them to express their emotions without judgment, and validate their feelings by acknowledging their loss. Let them know that it's okay to feel sad, angry, or confused, and that you're there to listen and support them.
2. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. Encourage them to take breaks and engage in activities that bring them joy and comfort.
3. Provide social support: Arrange for social activities or events where they can interact with others who have experienced similar losses. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to their community.
4. Offer counseling or therapy: Professional counseling or therapy can be beneficial in helping them process their grief and work through any emotional challenges. A mental health professional can provide guidance on how to manage their emotions and develop coping strategies.
5. Encourage communication: Create a safe space for them to express their feelings and concerns, and encourage open communication. Let them know that it's okay to talk about their loss and that you're there to listen and support them.
6. Help them find meaningful activities: Encourage them to engage in activities that provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, such as volunteering, pursuing hobbies, or spending time with loved ones. This can help them find meaning and purpose in their life after loss.
7. Respect their boundaries: Be mindful of their emotional limits and respect their boundaries. Don't push them to talk about their loss if they're not ready, and avoid pushing them to engage in activities that may be too challenging for them.
8. Offer practical support: Help them with practical tasks such as grocery shopping, household chores, or errands. This can help alleviate some of the stress and burden they may be feeling.
9. Encourage self-compassion: Remind them to be kind to themselves and practice self-compassion. Los
