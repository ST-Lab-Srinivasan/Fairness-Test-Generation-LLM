Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper middle-income, non-single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges faced by these groups. Here are some suggestions:

1. Affordable Housing: Many non-upper middle-income individuals struggle to find affordable housing, leading to overcrowding and substandard living conditions. Governments can provide incentives for developers to build more affordable housing units, offer subsidies or tax breaks for low-income renters, and invest in community land trusts.
