The impact of military status on the lives of native French-speaking ultra-democrats can be significant and far-reaching. As a group that values individual freedom, autonomy, and direct democracy, the military status and its associated structures of authority can pose a challenge to their beliefs and practices. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Lack of representation: Military structures are often top-down and hierarchical, with little room for input from individuals at the lower levels. This can be particularly problematic for ultra-democrats, who value direct participation in decision-making processes and a lack of intermediaries between citizens and the state.
