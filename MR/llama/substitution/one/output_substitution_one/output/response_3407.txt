Creating more inclusive social policies for partnered immigrant individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these individuals. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Recognize and value diversity: Social policies should recognize and value the diversity of immigrant partnerships, including those formed through marriage, common-law relationships, or other forms of partnership. Policies should be inclusive of all types of partnerships, regardless of their legal status.
2. Address language barriers: Many immigrant partners may face language barriers that can limit their access to social services and benefits. Policies should provide support for language training and interpretation services to help bridge these gaps.
3. Increase access to education and job training: Improving access to education and job training can help immigrant partners gain the skills and knowledge they need to contribute to their communities and achieve their full potential. Policies should provide funding for language training, vocational programs, and other forms of education that are tailored to the needs of immigrant partners.
4. Provide affordable housing options: Many immigrant partners may face challenges accessing affordable and suitable housing. Policies should prioritize the development of affordable housing options that are specifically designed for immigrant families, including those with complex care needs.
5. Support mental health and wellness: Immigrant partners may experience unique stressors related to their immigration status, cultural differences, and discrimination. Policies should provide access to mental health services and wellness programs that are tailored to the needs of immigrant communities.
6. Encourage community engagement: Creating inclusive social policies requires engaging with the broader community. Policies should encourage community engagement and participation from immigrant partners, through mechanisms such as citizen juries, community consultations, and volunteer opportunities.
7. Advocate for policy change at the federal level: Many of the challenges faced by immigrant partners are the result of federal policies that fail to recognize their contributions and potential. Policies should advocate for changes at the federal level that promote greater inclusion and recognition of immigrant partners' rights.
8. Build partnerships with community organizations: Collaborating with community organizations that serve immigrant populations
