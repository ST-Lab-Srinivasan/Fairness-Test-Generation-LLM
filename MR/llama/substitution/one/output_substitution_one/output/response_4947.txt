Promoting the social inclusion of deep in poverty communities, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy, is crucial for the well-being of both the mother and the baby. Here are some strategies that can be used to promote social inclusion:

1. Health Education: Provide health education sessions on proper nutrition, prenatal care, and baby care during the third trimester of pregnancy. This will help women understand the importance of proper care and provide them with the knowledge and skills needed to ensure a healthy pregnancy and birth.
2. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach programs to reach deep in poverty communities and provide information on available resources, such as prenatal care, nutrition programs, and support groups. This will help women feel more connected and supported throughout their pregnancy.
3. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that match experienced mothers with new mothers in deep in poverty communities. This will provide new mothers with guidance and support during the third trimester of pregnancy and beyond.
4. Support Groups: Facilitate support groups for women in deep in poverty communities, where they can share their experiences, receive emotional support, and connect with other women who are going through similar challenges.
5. Collaboration with Healthcare Providers: Work closely with healthcare providers to ensure that they are aware of the specific needs of deep in poverty communities and can provide appropriate care and referrals.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that address the root causes of poverty and promote social inclusion, such as affordable housing, access to education and job training, and living wage laws.
7. Community-Based Programs: Develop community-based programs that provide holistic support to women in deep in poverty communities, including mental health services, parenting classes, and job training.
8. Partnerships with Local Organizations: Establish partnerships with local organizations that serve deep in poverty communities, such as food banks, community centers, and religious organizations. These partnerships can help increase access to resources and promote social inclusion.
9. Cultural Humility: Approach outreach and programming with cultural humility, recognizing the unique experiences and perspectives
