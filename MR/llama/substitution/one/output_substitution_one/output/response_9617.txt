The impact of disability status on the lives of temporary visa holders, particularly those who were previously long-term single individuals, can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Reduced access to healthcare: Temporary visa holders may face barriers when seeking medical attention due to language or cultural differences, lack of knowledge about local healthcare systems, or concerns about discrimination based on their immigration status.
