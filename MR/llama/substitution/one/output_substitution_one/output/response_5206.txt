Ensuring that the educational needs of non-libertarian devout Hindu students are met requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach to education. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Incorporate Hinduism into the curriculum: Hinduism is one of the oldest and largest religions in the world, with a rich tradition of philosophy, literature, art, and culture. Incorporating Hinduism into the curriculum can help students learn about their own religion and culture, as well as appreciate the diversity of religious traditions around the world.
2. Provide opportunities for spiritual growth: Devout Hindu students may have a strong spiritual practice that includes prayer, meditation, or service to others. Schools can provide opportunities for students to engage in these practices during school hours or through extracurricular activities.
3. Respect and celebrate cultural diversity: Hinduism is a diverse religion with many different traditions and customs. Schools can celebrate the cultural diversity of their Hindu students by incorporating Hindu festivals and traditions into school events, such as Diwali or Holi.
4. Offer accommodations for religious practices: Some Hindu students may have dietary restrictions or other religious practices that need to be accommodated in the school setting. Schools can work with these students to find appropriate accommodations, such as providing vegetarian options in the cafeteria or allowing students to pray during school hours.
5. Provide support for Hindu student groups: Many Hindu students may feel a strong connection to their religion and culture, and may want to share this with their peers. Schools can provide support for Hindu student groups, such as hosting events or providing resources for group activities.
6. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Hinduism is one of many religions practiced around the world, and there are many opportunities for students to learn about and appreciate other religious traditions. Schools can encourage interfaith dialogue by hosting events or discussions that bring together students from different religious backgrounds.
7. Provide access to Hindu resources: Some Hindu students may need access to Hindu texts, such as the Bhagavad Gita or the Upanishads, in order to deepen their understanding of their religion
