The impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant beginner Caucasian speakers can vary greatly depending on a range of factors, including cultural and societal norms, individual experiences, and access to resources. Here are some potential impacts to consider:

1. Emotional Support: Marriage can provide emotional support during pregnancy, as partners can offer each other comfort, encouragement, and help with the physical and emotional demands of pregnancy.
2. Financial Stability: Married individuals may have better access to financial resources, such as health insurance, maternity leave, and childcare support, which can positively impact their experience during pregnancy.
3. Social Isolation: Pregnant women who are unmarried or in unhappy marriages may face social isolation, which can exacerbate the physical discomforts of pregnancy.
4. Decision-Making: Marriage can provide a supportive partner to help make decisions during pregnancy, such as choosing prenatal care providers or navigating childbirth options.
5. Role Expectations: Gender roles and expectations within marriage can influence how individuals experience pregnancy and parenthood. For example, married men may feel pressure to be the primary breadwinner, while married women may face expectations around childcare and household responsibilities.
6. Access to Healthcare: Married individuals may have better access to healthcare resources, such as gynecological care, prenatal testing, and birthing facilities, which can impact their pregnancy experience.
