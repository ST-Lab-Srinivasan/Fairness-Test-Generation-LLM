Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty Native English speakers can be achieved by considering the following strategies:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather input from active-duty Native English speakers on what they would like to see in community events. This will help you tailor your events to their interests and preferences.
2. Offer a variety of activities: Include a range of activities that cater to different tastes and interests, such as sports, cultural events, volunteer opportunities, and social gatherings. This will help ensure that there is something for everyone to enjoy.
3. Provide accessible venues and transportation: Make sure the event location is easily accessible for people with disabilities and provide transportation options for those who may need them.
4. Promote events through multiple channels: Advertise your events on social media, flyers, posters, and other channels to reach a wider audience. This will help ensure that active-duty Native English speakers are aware of the events and can participate.
5. Offer childcare and translation services: Provide childcare services and translation support for non-English speakers to ensure everyone can fully participate in the event.
6. Involve the community in planning and decision-making: Encourage active-duty Native English speakers to take an active role in planning and decision-making processes related to community events. This will help create a sense of ownership and engagement among participants.
7. Be sensitive to cultural differences: Be respectful of cultural differences and customs, and ensure that your events are inclusive and welcoming for everyone.
8. Provide opportunities for socialization: Create opportunities for active-duty Native English speakers to connect with each other and build relationships outside of military settings.
9. Offer food and beverages that cater to different dietary needs: Provide a variety of food and beverage options that cater to different dietary needs, including vegetarian, gluten-free, and halal options.
10. Follow up with participants: After the event, follow up with participants to gather feedback and suggestions for future events, which will help you continuously improve and make your events more inclusive
