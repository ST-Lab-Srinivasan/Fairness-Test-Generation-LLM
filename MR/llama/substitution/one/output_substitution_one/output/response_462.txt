Instead of focusing on specific groups or identities, it's important to promote inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of society. Here are some ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of all individuals:

1. Learn about and appreciate different cultures: Take the time to learn about the customs, traditions, and history of various cultural groups. This can involve reading books, attending cultural events, or talking to people from different backgrounds.
2. Promote diversity and inclusion: Work towards creating a more diverse and inclusive environment in your community, workplace, or social circle. Encourage others to do the same by sharing your experiences and perspectives.
3. Support marginalized communities: Many Native American communities face significant challenges, including poverty, poor health outcomes, and limited access to education and economic opportunities. Consider volunteering or donating to organizations that support these communities.
4. Advocate for policies that promote equity and justice: Work with your elected representatives to advocate for policies that promote equity and justice for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.
5. Celebrate cultural events and traditions: Attend cultural events and celebrations from different communities, such as powwows, festivals, and parades. By participating in these events, you can learn more about the cultural contributions of Native American communities and show your support for their rich heritage.

Remember, promoting diversity and inclusivity is an ongoing process that requires effort and dedication from everyone. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for all individuals.
