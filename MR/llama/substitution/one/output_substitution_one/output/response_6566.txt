Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speakers from moderate-income backgrounds requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Language Support: Provide language support during the event by offering translation services or providing written materials in multiple languages. This will help bridge the communication gap for those who may not be fluent in English.
2. Accessible Venue: Choose a venue that is easily accessible for people with disabilities. Ensure that the space is wheelchair-friendly, has adequate lighting and sound systems, and is located near public transportation.
3. Affordable Ticket Prices: Offer ticket prices that are affordable for moderate-income individuals. Consider offering discounts or scholarships to make the event more accessible to a broader audience.
4. Diverse Programming: Create a program that includes a diverse range of activities and workshops catering to different interests and needs. This can include cultural performances, art exhibitions, and interactive sessions on topics such as financial literacy, mental health, and career development.
5. Food and Beverage Options: Provide food and beverage options that cater to diverse dietary requirements and preferences. Offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options, and make sure to have a sufficient supply of water and other drinks throughout the event.
6. Childcare Services: Offer childcare services or provide a safe and comfortable area for parents to bring their children along. This can help ensure that participants don't have to worry about childcare arrangements during the event.
7. Interpretation Services: Provide interpretation services during the event, such as live translation or sign language interpretation, to make sure that everyone can participate and understand the content being presented.
8. Accessibility Features: Ensure that the event space is designed with accessibility features in mind, such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will help create a more inclusive environment for participants with disabilities.
9. Inclusive Marketing: Use marketing materials that are inclusive and respectful of diverse backgrounds and identities. Avoid using language or imagery that could be offensive or alienating to any particular group.
