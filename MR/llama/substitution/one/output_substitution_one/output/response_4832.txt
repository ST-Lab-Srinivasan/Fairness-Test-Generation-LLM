Addressing the specific needs of native English speaker beginner Arabic speakers in healthcare requires a tailored approach that considers their language barriers and cultural differences. Here are some strategies to help ensure these individuals receive quality care:

1. Cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers: Provide training on cultural competence and linguistic diversity to help healthcare providers understand the unique needs of non-native English speakers, particularly Arabic speakers. This can include learning about their cultural practices, values, and beliefs.

Use of interpreters and translators: Ensure that there are adequate resources for interpretation and translation services, including trained interpreters and translators who are fluent in both Arabic and English. This can help facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients who may not speak English fluently.
