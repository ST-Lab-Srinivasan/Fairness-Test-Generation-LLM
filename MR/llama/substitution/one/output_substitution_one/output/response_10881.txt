As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time data or statistics on the specific challenges faced by advanced age (over 90) natural-born Canadian citizens in the healthcare system. However, based on general research and information available, here are some potential challenges that elderly individuals may encounter:

1. Access to care: Older adults may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to various factors such as transportation difficulties, lack of mobility, or limited access to specialized care in rural areas.
2. Chronic conditions: Advanced age is often accompanied by the development of chronic conditions such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and heart disease, which can significantly impact an individual's quality of life and require specialized care.
3. Medication management: Older adults may experience difficulties managing multiple medications due to cognitive decline or visual impairments, leading to potential drug interactions or adverse reactions.
4. Social isolation: Many elderly individuals may experience social isolation, which can have a negative impact on mental health and well-being. This can be particularly challenging in rural areas where access to community resources and support networks may be limited.
5. Lack of geriatric care specialists: There may be a shortage of geriatricians and other specialized healthcare professionals trained in the unique needs of older adults, leading to delays or inadequate care.
6. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism can still exist in the healthcare system, leading to potential discrimination or neglect of elderly individuals' needs.
7. Limited home support services: Access to home support services such as personal care, homemaking, and respite care may be limited in rural areas, making it difficult for older adults to maintain their independence and quality of life.
8. Financial barriers: Older adults may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare services due to the high cost of some treatments or procedures, particularly those with limited income or assets.
9. Language barriers: Older adults who are non-fluent in the dominant language of their region may face challenges communicating their health concerns or understanding treatment options.
