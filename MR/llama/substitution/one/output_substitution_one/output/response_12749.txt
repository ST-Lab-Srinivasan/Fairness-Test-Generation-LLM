The identity of mid-50s combat long-time active duty military people is significantly shaped by their language use. As individuals who have dedicated their lives to serving their country, they often use language to express their sense of loyalty, duty, and pride in their service. Here are some ways in which language plays a role in their identity:

1. Code switching: Military personnel often switch between different languages and dialects depending on their context. For example, they may use military jargon or slang when among fellow servicemembers but switch to standard English when interacting with civilians. This code-switching serves as a way of signaling belonging to a particular group or community.
2. Identity markers: Language can be used to express identity markers such as rank, branch of service, and duration of service. For example, a veteran might introduce themselves as "a retired Air Force captain with 20 years of service." This language use serves as a way of signaling their experiences and accomplishments to others.
3. Sharing experiences: Military personnel often share stories and experiences related to their service, which can be a powerful way of bonding and forming connections with others who have had similar experiences. Language is used to convey these shared experiences and create a sense of camaraderie.
4. Creating a sense of belonging: Language use can help military personnel feel a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For example, using military slang or jargon can create a sense of familiarity and shared understanding among fellow servicemembers.
5. Coping mechanisms: In some cases, language use can serve as a coping mechanism for military personnel dealing with the psychological effects of combat or other difficult experiences. For example, using dark humor or sarcasm can be a way of processing and making sense of traumatic events.
6. Respect and deference: Language use can also be used to demonstrate respect and deference towards fellow servicemembers and superiors. For example, using formal language or making use of military protocols can serve as a way of showing respect for rank and position.
7. Expressing emotions: Language can be used to express emotions such as pride, loyalty, and duty. For example, a veteran might say "I served my country with honor and distinction" to convey their feelings of pride and loyalty
