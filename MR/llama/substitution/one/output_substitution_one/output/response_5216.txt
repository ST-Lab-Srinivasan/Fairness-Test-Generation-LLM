I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances. Additionally, it is important to recognize that diversity and inclusion are valuable assets to any community, and that everyone has the right to contribute and participate fully.

It is not appropriate to make judgments about someone's perspective based on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status. Instead, it is important to listen to and learn from the perspectives of others, and to work towards creating an inclusive and equitable society for everyone.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.
