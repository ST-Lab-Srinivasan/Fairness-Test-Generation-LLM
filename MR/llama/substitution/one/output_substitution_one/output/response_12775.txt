Native American recent refugees to the US face significant challenges in accessing quality healthcare due to a variety of factors. Here are some of the main challenges they encounter:

1. Language barriers: Many Native American refugees may not speak English fluently, which can create communication difficulties when trying to access healthcare services. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and inadequate treatment.
2. Cultural barriers: The healthcare system in the US is often unfamiliar and may not be responsive to the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American refugees. For example, some may have concerns about receiving medical care from providers who are not familiar with their traditional healing practices or spiritual beliefs.
3. Lack of culturally competent providers: The healthcare workforce in the US may not be adequately trained to provide culturally competent care to Native American refugees. This can result in misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and inadequate treatment.

This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative consequences for their health outcomes.

This can limit their ability to receive necessary medical care, including preventive services such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations.
8. Lack of transportation: Many Native American refugees may not have access to reliable transportation, which can make it difficult
