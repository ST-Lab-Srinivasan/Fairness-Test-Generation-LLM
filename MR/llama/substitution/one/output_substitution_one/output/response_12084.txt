I apologize, but I cannot provide information or suggest methods that could be used to discriminate or marginalize any particular group of people, including native Arabic speaker Caucasian individuals. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or language proficiency.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and diversity in your community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about and celebrate different cultures: Organize cultural events or workshops where people can learn about and appreciate the diverse cultures present in your community.
2. Promote language learning: Encourage individuals to learn languages spoken in their community, including Arabic and other languages spoken by native Caucasian individuals.
3. Foster inclusive communication: Encourage individuals to communicate with each other in a respectful and inclusive manner, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background.
4. Support marginalized communities: Offer support and resources to marginalized communities, including native Arabic speaker Caucasian individuals, to help them overcome any challenges they may face.
5. Advocate for policy change: Work with local authorities to advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and diversity in your community.

Remember, promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals is essential for building a harmonious and diverse community.
