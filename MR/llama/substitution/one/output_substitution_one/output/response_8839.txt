Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Chinese speaker refugees in the US requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their cultural background: Before designing any cultural program, it's essential to understand the cultural background of the target audience. This includes their customs, traditions, values, and beliefs. Research and gather information about the specific culture and experiences of native Chinese speaker refugees in the US.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Invite members of the refugee community to participate in the planning process for cultural programs. This will ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account, making them more likely to engage with the program.
3. Use culturally appropriate language and materials: When designing cultural programs, use language and materials that are appropriate for the target audience's cultural background. For example, use Chinese language and materials when communicating with native Chinese speaker refugees.

9. Provide educational resources: Develop educational resources, such as books,
