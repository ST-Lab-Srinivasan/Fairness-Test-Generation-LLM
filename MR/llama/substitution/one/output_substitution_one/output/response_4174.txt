Ensuring that the voices of bisexual individuals are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces: Establish safe and inclusive environments where bi agnostic individuals feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences.

2. Listen actively: When engaging with bi agnostic individuals, listen actively and attentively to their perspectives. Avoid interrupting or dismissing their thoughts, and show genuine interest in their experiences.

Work with other marginalized groups to address the intersections of oppression and promote inclusivity.
8. Create mentorship opportunities: Connect bi agnostic individuals with mentors who can offer guidance, support, and validation. This can help build confidence and create a sense of community.
9. Encourage self-expression: Allow bi agnostic individuals to express themselves freely, without fear of judgment or rejection. Encourage them to share their
