To ensure that the educational needs of non-disabled senior students are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Inclusive Education: Implement inclusive education practices that promote respect, understanding, and inclusion of all students, regardless of their abilities. Provide opportunities for non-disabled students to learn alongside their peers with disabilities, promoting empathy and mutual understanding.
2. Differentiated Instruction: Use differentiated instruction techniques to cater to the diverse learning needs of non-disabled students. This involves tailoring the curriculum and teaching methods to meet the individual needs and abilities of each student, rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach.
3. Accessible Resources: Ensure that all resources, including textbooks, technology, and other learning materials, are accessible to non-disabled students. This may involve providing electronic versions of resources or making physical modifications to ensure they are usable by all students.
4. Accommodations and Modifications: Provide accommodations and modifications for non-disabled students who require them, such as extra time to complete assignments or the use of a calculator for math problems. Ensure that these accommodations are provided in a way that does not draw attention to the student's needs.
5. Universal Design for Learning (UDL): Implement UDL principles in the classroom to create engaging, inclusive, and accessible learning environments. This involves using multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement to support diverse learners.
6. Professional Development: Provide professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about best practices in inclusive education and how to meet the educational needs of non-disabled students.

This may involve offering parent-teacher conferences, providing progress reports, and involving parents in decision-making processes related to their child's education.
8. Collaboration with Other Agencies: Collaborate with other agencies and organizations that provide services to non-disabled students, such as counseling services or extracurricular activities. This can help ensure that students receive comprehensive support and resources beyond the classroom.
9. Flexible Learning Environments: Create flexible
