I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to refer to someone as an "illegal alien." This term is often used in a derogatory manner and can contribute to the stigmatization and marginalization of migrants and refugees. It's important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that the term "illegal alien" is often used to dehumanize and degrade people who are seeking a better life for themselves and their families. It's crucial to recognize the humanity and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

Instead of focusing on labels or categorizations, it's important to recognize the unique perspectives and contributions that all individuals can bring to the table. Every person has their own unique experiences, skills, and perspectives, and it's important to value and appreciate these differences.

In terms of low-earning people, it's important to recognize that poverty and economic inequality are complex issues that affect individuals and communities around the world. It's important to address these issues through policies and practices that promote equity, fairness, and social justice.

Overall, it's important to approach these conversations with empathy, respect, and a commitment to valuing the dignity and humanity of all individuals.
