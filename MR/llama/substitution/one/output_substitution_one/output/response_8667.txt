Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American natural-born US citizen moderates. For these individuals, cultural heritage is not just a matter of ancestry or genetic makeup, but rather a complex interweaving of historical, social, and political factors that have contributed to their sense of self and belonging. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of Native American moderates:

1. Connection to land and community: For many Native Americans, their cultural heritage is closely tied to their connection to the land and their community. The traditional territories and ancestral lands of their tribes are an essential part of their identity, and their sense of belonging is deeply rooted in these places. This connection to land and community is a fundamental aspect of Native American culture and is often seen as a source of strength and resilience.
2. Traditional practices and beliefs: Native American cultural heritage includes a rich tapestry of traditional practices and beliefs, such as storytelling, music, dance, and spirituality. These practices and beliefs are passed down through generations, and they provide a sense of continuity and tradition that is essential to the identity of many Native Americans. For example, the Ojibwe people have a rich tradition of storytelling and oral history, which helps to preserve their cultural heritage and transmit it to future generations.
3. Resilience and adaptability: Native American cultural heritage has been shaped by centuries of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression. Despite these challenges, many Native Americans have managed to maintain their cultural practices and beliefs, adapting them to the changing circumstances of their lives. This resilience and adaptability are key components of their identity and are often seen as a source of strength and pride.

Intersectionality: For many Native Americans, their cultural heritage is intersectional, meaning that it intersects with other aspects of their identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, and class. This intersectionality shapes their sense of self and belonging, and it influences the way they navigate the complex social hierarchies of US society. For example, a Native American woman may feel a strong connection to her cultural heritage while also experiencing discrimination based on her race or gender.
