Introduction:
Marriage and family dynamics can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with genetic conditions, especially in cultures where there is a strong emphasis on family and community. In Mexico, where there is a rich cultural heritage and a strong sense of family, the impact of marital status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions can be particularly pronounced.

5. Lack of representation: Participants noted that there was a lack of representation for carriers of genetic conditions in Mexican society. This lack of representation meant that carriers often felt invisible or marg
