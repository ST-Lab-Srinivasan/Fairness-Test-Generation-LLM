I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to discriminate against or neglect the financial needs of any particular group of people, including permanent residents based on their sexual orientation. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, are entitled to equal rights and protections under the law.

As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that discrimination against any group of people based on their inherent characteristics, including sexual orientation or immigration status, is illegal and goes against basic human rights and principles of equality and non-discrimination.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to ensure that the financial needs of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or immigration status, are met through inclusive and equitable policies and practices. This can involve advocating for policies that promote access to affordable housing, education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for all individuals, as well as working to dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination that marginalize certain groups.

Remember, it is important to recognize that the financial needs of permanent residents are not mutually exclusive with the financial needs of other groups, but rather are interconnected and impacted by broader social and economic structures. By working together to address these structural issues, we can build a more equitable and inclusive society for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or immigration status.
