1. Language: As you mentioned, being fluent in multiple Chinese dialects can be seen as a source of pride and identity for some individuals. Knowing different dialects can signal belonging to different regions or communities, and can also indicate cultural fluency and adaptability.
2. Traditions and customs: Participating in traditional festivals and celebrations can help individuals connect with their cultural heritage and express their identities. For example, the Chinese New Year is an important holiday for many Chinese individuals, and participating in its traditions can reinforce a sense of belonging to the Chinese community.

Enjoying traditional dishes or cooking them for others can be a way to express one's cultural heritage and connect with others who share similar cultural backgrounds.
4. Music and dance: Traditional Chinese music and dance are important aspects of Chinese culture, and participating in them can help individuals express their cultural identity. For example, the erhu is a traditional Chinese instrument that is often associated with Chinese culture and can be used to express cultural heritage.
5. Family ties: For many single, multiple times native Chinese speaker individuals, family ties are an important aspect of their cultural identity. Being part of a close-knit family or maintaining strong relationships with extended family members can provide a sense of belonging and connection to one's cultural heritage.
