I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality, including prioritizing the healthcare needs of a particular group of people based on their social status or language proficiency.

It is important to recognize that the healthcare system should strive to provide equitable and inclusive care to all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, language proficiency, or socioeconomic status. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines universal health coverage (UHC) as "all people having access to the health services they need without financial hardship."
