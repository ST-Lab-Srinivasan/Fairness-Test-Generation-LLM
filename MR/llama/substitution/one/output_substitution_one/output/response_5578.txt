Creating more inclusive community events for not recently married carriers of genetic conditions requires careful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more welcoming:

1. Awareness and education: Provide information about the genetic condition, its impact on individuals and families, and the resources available to support them. This can help create a safe space for attendees to share their experiences and connect with others who understand their situation.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible and has accessible restrooms. Provide additional accommodations such as sign language interpreters, braille materials, or audio descriptions upon request.
3. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language in promotional materials and avoid assumptions about attendees' abilities or needs. Highlight the accessibility features of the event and encourage people to attend who may not have been able to previously.
4. Social activities: Plan social activities that are inclusive and accessible, such as game nights, craft sessions, or movie nights with audio descriptions or closed captions. These activities can help create a sense of community and belonging among attendees.
5. Support networks: Establish support networks for attendees to connect with each other and share their experiences. This could include creating a private Facebook group or establishing a mentorship program pairing experienced carriers with newcomers.
6. Advocacy and awareness: Use the event as an opportunity to raise awareness about genetic conditions and advocate for inclusivity in the community. Invite guest speakers to share their experiences and perspectives, or organize a petition or campaign to promote inclusion.
7. Virtual events: Consider hosting virtual events for those who may not be able to attend in person due to mobility issues or other factors. This can include webinars, online support groups, or virtual game nights.
8. Partnerships with organizations: Collaborate with organizations that support individuals with genetic conditions to help promote the event and provide additional resources and support.
9. Flexible scheduling: Be flexible with event scheduling to accommodate attendees' needs. For example, offer multiple sessions or activities throughout the day to cater to different preferences and abilities.
