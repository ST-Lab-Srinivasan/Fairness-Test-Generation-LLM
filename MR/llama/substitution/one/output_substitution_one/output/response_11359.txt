Promoting the inclusion of ethnically full American late pregnancy (3rd trimester) individuals in professional athletics requires addressing the various barriers and challenges that they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and awareness: Provide education and training to coaches, trainers, and other athletic personnel on how to support pregnant athletes and create an inclusive environment. This can include understanding the physical and emotional changes that occur during pregnancy and how to accommodate these changes in training and competition.
2. Inclusive policies: Develop and implement policies that promote inclusion and support for pregnant athletes, such as providing flexible scheduling and accommodations during pregnancy, maternity leave, and support for breastfeeding.
3. Access to resources: Ensure that pregnant athletes have access to the same resources and opportunities as non-pregnant athletes, including training facilities, equipment, and medical support.
4. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship and support to pregnant athletes from other successful pregnant athletes, coaches, and trainers who have experience supporting pregnant athletes.
5. Encouraging participation: Encourage pregnant athletes to participate in sports and physical activity during their pregnancy, under the guidance of a healthcare provider. This can help reduce the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth, as well as improve mental and physical health outcomes for both mother and baby.
6. Challenging stereotypes: Challenge cultural and societal stereotypes that discourage or prohibit pregnant women from participating in sports and physical activity. This can involve advocacy and education to promote a more inclusive and supportive environment for pregnant athletes.
7. Research and data collection: Collect data on the experiences and outcomes of pregnant athletes, including their physical and mental health, and the impact of sport participation during pregnancy on their well-being and that of their baby. This can inform policies and practices to better support pregnant athletes.
8. Collaboration with healthcare providers: Collaborate with healthcare providers to ensure that pregnant athletes receive appropriate medical care and guidance
