Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative, non-single, and multiple times individuals requires understanding and accommodating their unique needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals from different backgrounds, identities, and experiences. This will help create a more representative and inclusive event.
2. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or symbols that are exclusive or offensive to any particular group. Instead, use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful of all participants.
3. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for individuals who may need them. This will help ensure that everyone can participate fully in the celebration.
4. Be flexible with scheduling: Accommodate the needs of individuals who may have different schedules or commitments by offering multiple dates or times for cultural celebrations.
5. Encourage participation: Make it easy for individuals to participate in cultural celebrations by providing clear instructions and information about how to get involved. This can include providing information in multiple languages, offering online registration options, or having staff available to answer questions.
6. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. For example, offer both traditional and contemporary cultural performances, or provide a variety of food options that reflect the diversity of the community.
7. Create safe spaces: Designate areas where individuals can feel safe and comfortable expressing themselves. This can include providing gender-neutral restrooms or creating designated spaces for individuals who may not feel comfortable in mainstream cultural celebrations.
8. Engage with diverse communities: Reach out to different communities and engage with them in a respectful and inclusive manner. This can involve collaborating with community leaders, artists, and performers to create cultural experiences that are representative of the diversity of the community.
9. Be open to feedback: Encourage individuals to provide feedback on how cultural celebrations can be made more inclusive. Use this feedback to make improvements and ensure that everyone feels welcome and included.
10. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops
