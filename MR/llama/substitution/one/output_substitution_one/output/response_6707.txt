Low-earning nationals in the healthcare system face several challenges that hinder their access to quality healthcare. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Financial barriers: Low-earning nationals often struggle to afford healthcare services, including out-of-pocket expenses for medication, tests, and procedures. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate illnesses and reduce overall well-being.
2. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Low-earning nationals may live in areas with limited access to healthcare facilities, including rural or remote areas. This can make it difficult to access timely and appropriate care, particularly for chronic conditions that require ongoing management.

This can lead to delays in seeking care or misunderstandings about available resources.
