Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term unemployed, recently married individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this demographic. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Address the root causes of unemployment: Long-term unemployment is often a result of structural issues in the economy, such as lack of job opportunities, discrimination, and skills mismatches. Policymakers must address these underlying issues by investing in job training programs, promoting entrepreneurship, and creating jobs in growing industries.
2. Provide marriage-specific benefits: Recently married individuals face unique challenges, such as increased living expenses and reduced income due to the transition from single to married life. Policymakers can provide marriage-specific benefits, such as financial assistance for couples, tax credits for married couples, and subsidies for affordable housing.
3. Foster a supportive community: Long-term unemployment and marriage can be isolating experiences, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. Policymakers can foster a supportive community by providing resources for social connections, such as job clubs, mentorship programs, and volunteer opportunities.
4. Encourage work-life balance: Married individuals often face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities. Policymakers can encourage work-life balance by providing flexible working arrangements, paid parental leave, and affordable childcare options.
5. Address health disparities: Long-term unemployment and marriage can lead to increased health disparities, such as higher rates of depression, anxiety, and chronic diseases. Policymakers can address these disparities by providing access to affordable healthcare, promoting mental health resources, and encouraging healthy lifestyle choices.
6. Provide financial assistance: Long-term unemployment can lead to financial insecurity, while marriage can increase living expenses. Policymakers can provide financial assistance through programs such as unemployment benefits, subsidized housing, and low-interest loans for education or business start-ups.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Long-term unemployment and marriage can lead to feelings of disconnection from society.
