Creating more inclusive community programs for active-duty recently married individuals requires understanding their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and supportive:

1. Offer childcare options: Many active-duty military spouses have young children, making it difficult to participate in community programs without reliable childcare. Provide on-site childcare or partner with local organizations that offer this service.
2. Flexible scheduling: Military families often face unexpected deployments, moves, and other changes that can disrupt their schedules. Offer flexible programming times or online options to accommodate these challenges.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all marketing materials, program descriptions, and communications to ensure that all spouses feel welcome. Avoid using gendered language or making assumptions based on marital status.
4. Family-friendly activities: Design programs that are enjoyable for the whole family, such as movie nights, game nights, or outdoor activities like hiking or picnics. This will help build a sense of community and belonging among participants.
5. Spouse-only events: Organize occasional spouse-only events or workshops to provide a space for military spouses to connect, share experiences, and build support networks without their partners.
6. Partner with local businesses: Collaborate with local businesses to offer discounts or special offers to active-duty military families. This can help reduce financial strain and enhance the overall quality of life for these individuals.
7. Establish a mentorship program: Pair recently married military spouses with more experienced peers who can offer guidance, support, and advice on navigating military life.
8. Offer educational resources: Provide access to educational resources, such as workshops or webinars, that cover topics relevant to active-duty military families, like financial planning, home ownership, and career development.
9. Create a community platform: Develop an online platform or social media group where military spouses can connect, share information, and support one another.
10. Evaluate and adjust: Regularly assess the needs and satisfaction levels of active-duty recently married individuals through surveys or focus groups. Use this feedback
