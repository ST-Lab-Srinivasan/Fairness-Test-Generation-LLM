This can lead them to prioritize issues related to tribal sovereignty, land rights, and environmental protection.

Furthermore, cultural heritage can play a role in shaping the political beliefs and values of Native American individuals beyond just their sense of identity. For example, many Native Americans may be more likely to support progressive policies that promote social justice, equality, and environmental sustainability due to their cultural values and beliefs.

It informs their sense of self, influences their political beliefs and values, and shapes how they understand and experience their citizenship in the United States.
