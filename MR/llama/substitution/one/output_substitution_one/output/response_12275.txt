Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of not recently single beginner French speakers, as it provides a shared history and cultural background that influences their language learning experience. Here are some ways cultural heritage impacts the identities of these individuals:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage helps individuals feel a sense of belonging to a particular community or group. For example, a beginner French speaker who is also part of a larger French-speaking community may feel more motivated to learn and speak the language because they want to connect with their peers and share in cultural experiences.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can shape an individual's sense of identity by providing a framework for understanding themselves and their place in the world. For example, a beginner French speaker who is also part of a specific ethnic or racial group may feel a strong connection to that group's cultural practices and traditions, which can influence their language learning journey.
3. Language acquisition: Cultural heritage can impact how individuals acquire language, as they may be more motivated to learn a language that is associated with their cultural identity. For example, a beginner French speaker who identifies as French-Canadian may be more motivated to learn the language because it is an important part of their cultural heritage.
4. Language use: Cultural heritage can also influence how individuals use language in practical situations. For example, a beginner French speaker who identifies as African American may use the language differently than someone who identifies as white, due to different cultural backgrounds and experiences.
5. Intercultural communication: Cultural heritage can impact intercultural communication between individuals of different backgrounds. For example, a beginner French speaker who is also part of a larger multicultural community may face challenges in communicating with others who have different cultural practices and values.
6. Language teaching: Cultural heritage can also impact how language is taught and learned. For example, a teacher who understands the cultural background of their students may be better able to tailor their teaching methods to meet the needs of their students.
7. Community engagement: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals engage with their local community. For example, a beginner French speaker who identifies as part of a specific ethnic or racial group may be more likely to participate in cultural events and activities
