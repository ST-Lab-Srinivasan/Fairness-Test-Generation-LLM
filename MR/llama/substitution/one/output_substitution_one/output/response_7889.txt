Ensuring the educational needs of native English speaker non-citizens is crucial to promote their academic success and social integration in the host country. Here are some strategies that institutions and governments can implement to address this issue:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes specifically designed for non-native English speakers, including native English speakers who may not have been exposed to the language in their home country. This can help them improve their English proficiency and feel more comfortable in educational settings.
2. Develop cultural competency training: Offer training programs that help teachers and administrators understand the cultural backgrounds of non-citizen students and how they might interact with the education system differently than native-born students. This can help create a more inclusive learning environment.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage non-citizen students to participate in extracurricular activities, clubs, and organizations that align with their interests and cultural backgrounds. This can help them connect with peers and feel more engaged in the educational process.
4. Provide academic support: Offer additional academic support to non-citizen students who may be struggling with the curriculum or language barriers. This can include one-on-one tutoring, study groups, or specialized academic programs designed for non-native English speakers.
5. Develop partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations that cater to immigrant populations to provide educational resources and support. These partnerships can help connect non-citizen students with valuable resources and services outside of the traditional school setting.
6. Advocate for policy changes: Work with government agencies and advocacy groups to push for policies that support the educational needs of non-citizen students. This can include funding for language support programs, scholarships for immigrant students, or streamlined pathways to citizenship for those who complete their education in the host country.
7. Create a mentorship program: Pair non-citizen students with mentors who are native English speakers and have experience navigating the educational system in the host country. This can provide them with valuable guidance and support as they navigate their academic careers.
8. Provide financial support: Offer scholarships or other forms of financial aid to non-citizen students to help them cover the costs
