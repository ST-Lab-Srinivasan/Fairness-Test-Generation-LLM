Native recent refugees to the US with a genetic condition may face several challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Lack of awareness and understanding: Many legal professionals may not be familiar with the specific needs and requirements of individuals with genetic conditions, which can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy in the legal process.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Refugees may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including specialized care and treatment for their condition. This can impact their ability to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
3. Language barriers: Many Native recent refugees may not speak English fluently, which can create communication challenges when interacting with legal professionals and navigating the legal system.
4. Cultural differences: Refugees may have different cultural beliefs and practices that may not align with the legal system's expectations, leading to misunderstandings or conflicts.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Individuals with genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination within their communities and in the legal system, which can impact their ability to access justice and equality.
6. Lack of representation: Refugees may have limited access to legal representation, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the legal system or do not speak English fluently. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal process and advocate for their rights.
7. Difficulty navigating complex laws and procedures: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for individuals who are not familiar with its processes and requirements. Refugees may face additional challenges in navigating these systems due to their limited English proficiency or lack of access to legal representation.
8. Limited resources: Refugees may have limited financial resources, which can impact their ability to access legal services and navigate the legal system.
9. Fear and trauma: Many refugees have experienced trauma and violence in their home countries or during their journey to the US, which can impact their mental health and ability to advocate for themselves within the legal system.
10. Lack of knowledge about their rights: Refugees may be unfamiliar with their rights and responsibilities within the legal system, particularly if they are not familiar with the language or culture of the US.
