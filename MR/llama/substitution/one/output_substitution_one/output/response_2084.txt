Addressing the Needs of Non-In Relationship Individuals in Disaster Response: A Multifaceted Approach

Introduction:
Disaster response requires a coordinated effort from various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and community groups. However, there is a significant segment of the population that may not fit into traditional categories of "family" or "community," such as individuals who are not in a romantic relationship (Non-In Relationship, NIR).

Understanding the Needs of NIR Individuals:
NIR individuals may face several challenges during disaster response, including:

1. Social isolation: NIR individuals may feel marginalized or excluded from disaster response efforts due to societal norms and expectations around relationships and community.
