Creating more inclusive cultural programs for early pregnancy (1st trimester) physically-disabled individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural program is accessible to all, including those with physical disabilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility, braille or large print materials, and sign language interpretation as needed.
2. Modify activities: Adapt activities to accommodate physical limitations. For example, instead of a dance performance, consider a movement-based activity that can be modified for individuals with mobility impairments.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all promotional materials and program descriptions. Avoid using language that assumes able-bodiedness or ignores the experiences of individuals with disabilities.
4. Partner with organizations: Collaborate with organizations that support individuals with disabilities to ensure that the cultural program is accessible and inclusive. These partners can provide valuable insights and expertise in creating an inclusive environment.
5. Flexibility: Allow for flexibility in programming to accommodate different abilities and needs. Offer a variety of activities and experiences, such as visual or tactile art-making, storytelling, or music-making, that can be enjoyed by all.
6. Education and awareness: Provide education and raise awareness about disability culture and the importance of inclusivity. This can help create a more inclusive environment and promote understanding and respect for individuals with disabilities.
7. Hire disabled artists: Incorporate works by disabled artists into the cultural program to showcase their talents and contributions. This can help promote representation and inclusion in the arts.
8. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language and imagery in promotional materials to reach a diverse audience. Avoid using able-bodied models or language that assumes able-bodiedness.
9. Accessibility training: Provide accessibility training for staff and volunteers to ensure they are equipped to support individuals with disabilities. This can include training on accessible programming, communication, and customer service.
10. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate the cultural program's accessibility and inclusivity. Solicit feedback from participants and make improvements as needed to ensure that the program is inclusive
