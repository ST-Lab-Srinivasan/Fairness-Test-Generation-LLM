Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-long-time single individuals requires thoughtful planning, consideration of diverse needs, and a willingness to challenge traditional norms. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Event Design:
	* Consider the accessibility of venues, activities, and performances. Make sure they are wheelchair accessible and have accessible entrances, exits, and restrooms.
	* Provide accommodations for individuals with sensory sensitivities, such as noise-cancelling headphones or quiet rooms.
	* Offer flexible seating options, like bean bags or comfortable cushions, to ensure everyone can comfortably participate in activities.
2. Representation Matters:
	* Ensure that the event's marketing materials, including posters, flyers, and social media posts, feature diverse individuals, including those with disabilities and non-traditional family structures.
	* Consider hiring performers or speakers from underrepresented groups to bring fresh perspectives and experiences to the celebration.
3. Accessible Activities:
	* Plan activities that are inclusive of all participants, such as sign language interpretation for deaf individuals or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
	* Offer activities that cater to different abilities, like a "sensory-friendly" zone with fidget toys and weighted blankets for individuals with sensory processing needs.
4. Communication and Accessibility:
	* Provide multiple ways for participants to access information, such as braille or large print materials, audio descriptions, or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation.
	* Train staff and volunteers on disability etiquette and communication strategies to ensure everyone feels comfortable and included.
5. Involve the Community:
	* Engage with local disability organizations and advocacy groups to gather input and suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural celebrations.
	* Encourage community members to share their ideas and perspectives through surveys, focus groups, or town hall meetings.
6. Flexible Scheduling:
	* Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate different needs, such as multiple event times or a "quiet hour" for
