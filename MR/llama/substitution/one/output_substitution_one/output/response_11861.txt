As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity, are entitled to equal protection under the law. The legal rights of immigrant natural-born US citizens and fully heterosexual individuals should be protected by the Constitution and federal laws. Here are some ways to ensure these rights are protected:

1. Equal Protection Under the Law: The Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution provides that "no state...shall...deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." This means that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status or sexual orientation, are entitled to the same legal protections and rights as other citizens.
2. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Federal and state laws prohibit discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, and sexual orientation. These laws should be enforced to ensure that immigrant natural-born US citizens and fully heterosexual individuals are not subjected to discrimination or unequal treatment under the law.
3. Due Process and Non-Discrimination Provisions: The US Constitution provides for due process and non-discrimination provisions, which ensure that all individuals have access to fair and impartial legal proceedings. This means that immigrant natural-born US citizens and fully heterosexual individuals should not be subjected to arbitrary or discriminatory treatment under the law.
4. Right to Privacy: The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution provides a right to privacy, which includes the protection of personal information and the right to keep one's sexual orientation and immigration status private if desired.
5. Access to Legal Services: Immigrant natural-born US citizens and fully heterosexual individuals should have access to legal services and representation, including those related to immigration status, family law, and criminal defense. This ensures that they are able to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
6. Education and Awareness: Educating the public about the legal rights of immigrant natural-born US citizens and fully heterosexual individuals can help promote understanding and acceptance of these groups. This can involve providing information through schools, community organizations, and media outlets.
