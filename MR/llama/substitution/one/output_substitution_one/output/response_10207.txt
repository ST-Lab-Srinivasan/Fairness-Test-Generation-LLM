Promoting the inclusion of moderate early pregnancy (1st trimester) individuals in casual athletics requires a thoughtful and supportive approach. Here are some strategies to help make this happen:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the physical and emotional changes that occur during pregnancy, and the importance of exercise during this time. Share this knowledge with your community to dispel any misconceptions or stigmas related to pregnant women participating in sports.
2. Create a safe and supportive environment: Ensure that your athletic facilities and events are accessible and welcoming for pregnant individuals. Provide comfortable and appropriate clothing, and offer modifications to exercises to accommodate their needs.
3. Set clear guidelines: Establish guidelines for pregnant athletes to follow, such as avoiding high-impact activities or certain exercises that may be harmful during this time. Encourage them to consult with their healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program.
4. Offer prenatal fitness classes: Develop specialized prenatal fitness classes that cater to the needs of pregnant individuals. These classes can provide a safe and supportive environment for them to engage in physical activity during this time.
5. Encourage self-care: Pregnant athletes may need to take extra care of themselves, especially during the first trimester when their bodies are undergoing significant changes. Encourage them to prioritize rest, hydration, and nutrition, and provide resources for managing morning sickness or other discomforts.
6. Engage in peer support: Pregnant athletes may feel isolated or unsure of how to navigate their pregnancy while still participating in sports. Encourage them to connect with other pregnant athletes who can offer emotional support and practical advice.
7. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with your organization's leadership and policy-makers to develop inclusive policies that support the participation of pregnant individuals in sports. Ensure that these policies address any potential barriers or concerns, such as accessibility, safety, and discrimination.
8. Provide resources for postpartum recovery: Once the pregnant athlete has given birth
