Supporting the community engagement of Native natural-born US citizen agnostics can be a challenging task, as they may face unique barriers and obstacles due to their cultural background and beliefs. Here are some strategies that could help support their community engagement:

1. Listen and validate their experiences: It's essential to create a safe and non-judgmental space where Native agnostics can express their thoughts and feelings without fear of criticism or rejection. Listen actively, and validate their experiences to show that you understand and respect their perspective.
2. Provide cultural context: Many Native agnostics may feel disconnected from traditional religious practices and rituals, which can lead to a sense of isolation. Providing cultural context and explanations of traditional beliefs and practices can help them better understand their own culture and heritage.
3. Foster inclusive spaces: Create spaces where Native agnostics feel welcome and included. This could involve hosting events or activities that are tailored to their interests and needs, such as cultural workshops, community service projects, or social gatherings.
4. Offer resources and support: Provide access to resources and support that can help Native agnostics navigate their spiritual journey. This could include books, articles, or online forums where they can connect with others who share similar beliefs and experiences.
5. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Engage in intergenerational dialogue between Native elders and youth to promote cultural exchange and understanding. This can help bridge the gap between traditional beliefs and modern-day realities, and create a more inclusive and respectful community.
6. Advocate for policy change: Work with local and national organizations to advocate for policies that support the rights and dignity of Native agnostics. This could involve pushing for legal recognition of their cultural identity or challenging discriminatory practices that marginalize them.
7. Create opportunities for mentorship: Pair Native agnostic youth with mentors who can provide guidance and support in navigating their spiritual journey. This could involve connecting them with elders, community leaders, or other individuals who can offer wisdom and support.
8. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Promote cross-cultural understanding and respect by organizing events that bring together people from different cultural backgrounds.
