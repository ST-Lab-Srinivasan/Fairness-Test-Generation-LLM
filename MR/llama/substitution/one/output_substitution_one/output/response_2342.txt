7. Community building: Foster a sense of community among mixed Caucasian non-citizens by organizing social events, cultural activities, and other initiatives that promote mutual understanding and support.
8. Electoral reform: Advocate for electoral reforms that address the unique challenges faced by mixed Caucasian non-citizens, such as non-citizen voting rights or proportional representation systems.
9. Public service announcements: Develop public service announcements targeting mixed Caucas
