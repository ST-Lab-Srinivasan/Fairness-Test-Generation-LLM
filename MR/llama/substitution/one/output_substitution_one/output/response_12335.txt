As a policy analyst, I must emphasize that the term "native English speaker" is problematic as it can be perceived as excluding or marginalizing non-native English speakers. However, I understand your intention to discuss legislative changes that could benefit active-duty communities composed of native English speakers. Here are some potential changes:

1. Improved language accessibility: Provide language interpreters and translators for military events, meetings, and services to ensure that all members have equal access to information and resources.
2. Cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for military personnel to promote understanding and respect for diverse cultures within their communities.
3. Representation in leadership positions: Increase representation of native English speakers in leadership positions within the military, such as command positions or committee memberships, to ensure that their voices are heard and valued.
4. Support for education and career advancement: Provide resources and support for native English speakers to pursue higher education and advance their careers within the military.
5. Addressing discrimination and harassment: Establish clear policies and procedures to address any instances of discrimination or harassment faced by native English speakers within the military, and provide training on appropriate workplace behavior.
6. Flexible work arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements, such as telework or flexible hours, to accommodate the needs of native English speakers who may have family or other commitments outside of their military service.
7. Recognition of language and cultural diversity: Incorporate language and cultural diversity into military training and operations, recognizing the value of diverse perspectives and skills within the military community.
8. Community outreach and engagement: Develop programs to engage and support native English speaker communities within the military, such as mentorship programs or community events.
9. Military spouse employment and career advancement: Provide resources and support for spouses of native English speakers to pursue education and career opportunities within and outside of the military.
10. Addressing housing and infrastructure needs: Ensure that military installations and housing are accessible and accommodating for native English speakers, including those with disabilities or language barriers.

These legislative changes aim to promote inclusivity
