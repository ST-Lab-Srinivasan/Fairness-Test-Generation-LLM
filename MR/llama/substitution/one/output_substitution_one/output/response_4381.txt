Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty personnel and their families can be challenging, especially for those below the poverty line. Here are some suggestions on how to make these events more accessible and affordable:

1. Offer financial assistance: Provide financial assistance to military personnel and their families who may struggle to attend community events due to budget constraints. This could include scholarships, grants, or subsidies to help cover event costs.
2. Host events on military bases: Hosting events on military bases can make it easier for active-duty personnel to attend without incurring additional transportation costs. Consider partnering with base commanders to host events in military facilities.
3. Use online platforms: Utilize online platforms like social media, email, or messaging apps to promote community events and engage with military personnel and their families. This can help reach a wider audience and make it easier for those who may not be able to attend in person.
4. Provide childcare and transportation support: Offering childcare and transportation support can help alleviate some of the financial burdens that may prevent military personnel and their families from attending community events. Partner with local organizations or businesses to provide these services.
5. Involve the military community in event planning: Encourage active-duty personnel and their families to participate in event planning and decision-making processes. This can help ensure that the needs and preferences of the military community are taken into account when organizing events.
6. Offer flexible scheduling options: Military personnel often have irregular work schedules or deployment rotations, which can make it difficult to attend events at fixed times. Consider offering flexible scheduling options, such as evening or weekend events, or providing virtual participation options for those who cannot attend in person.
7. Collaborate with local businesses: Partnering with local businesses can help provide additional resources and support for community events. Local businesses may be willing to donate materials, supplies, or services to help make events more accessible and affordable for military personnel and their families.
8. Provide translation and interpretation services: Offering translation and interpretation services can help ensure that all members of the military community feel included and supported. This can be particularly important for those who may not speak the dominant language in the area.
