Creating more inclusive public spaces for conservative Native Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach to design, planning, and management. Here are some strategies that can help:

2. Provide gender-segregated spaces: Many conservative Native Arabic speakers may feel more comfortable in gender-segregated spaces. Providing separate areas for men and women can help create a sense of comfort and security.
3. Offer prayer facilities: Providing designated prayer areas for both men and women can be an important consideration for conservative Native Arabic speakers who practice Islam. Ensure that the prayer areas are clean, well-maintained, and easily accessible.
4. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities and avoid using binary gender terms (i.e., "men" and "women"). For example, use language like "everyone," "all genders," or "gender-neutral language."
