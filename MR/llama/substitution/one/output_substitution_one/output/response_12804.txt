Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of native English speaker infant female individuals. The marital status of an individual can affect various aspects of their life, including their emotional well-being, social relationships, economic stability, and overall quality of life. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of native English speaker infant female individuals and explore how it influences their development, health, and well-being.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect the mental and physical health of individuals, particularly women. For instance, married women tend to have better mental health outcomes compared to unmarried women (Teachman & Pbert, 2001). Marriage has also been linked to improved physical health outcomes, such as lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels (Hillier et al., 2006). However, the impact of marital status on infant female individuals is not well-studied.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of native English speaker infant female individuals aged 0-3 years old. The questionnaire will collect information on the children's marital status (i.e., married/unmarried), as well as their mothers' education level, employment status, and social support networks. Additionally, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants to gather more in-depth information on the impact of marital status on their lives.

Expected Outcomes:
The study aims to identify the impacts of marital status on the lives of native English speaker infant female individuals. Specifically, we expect to find that married infants will have better cognitive and emotional development compared to unmarried infants. We also expect to find that married mothers will have better social relationships and economic stability compared to unmarried mothers.

Conclusion:
This study will provide valuable insights into the impacts of marital status on the lives of native English speaker infant female individuals. The findings can inform policies and interventions aimed at promoting the health and well-being of these individuals, particularly in the context of marriage and family relationships.
