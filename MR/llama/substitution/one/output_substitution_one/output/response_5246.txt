As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question as it is based on stereotypes and biases. The legal system should treat all individuals equally regardless of their race, age, or ethnicity. However, there are certain challenges that may be experienced by older African-American individuals in the legal system, including:

1. Ageism: Older adults may face ageism within the legal system, which can result in a lack of respect and empathy from judges, lawyers, and other legal professionals.
2. Racial bias: Discrimination based on race is illegal, but it still occurs in the legal system. African-American individuals over 90 years old may face racial biases that can affect their treatment within the legal system.
3. Limited access to resources: Older adults may have limited mobility or financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to access legal services or navigate the court system.
4. Cognitive decline: As people age, they may experience cognitive decline, which can affect their ability to understand and participate in legal proceedings.
5. Lack of representation: Older African-American individuals may have difficulty finding attorneys who specialize in elder law or are knowledgeable about the specific challenges faced by older adults in the legal system.
6. Limited social support: Older adults may have limited social support networks, which can make it difficult for them to access emotional and practical support during legal proceedings.
7. Historical trauma: African-American individuals have experienced historical trauma related to racism and discrimination, which can affect their mental health and well-being when interacting with the legal system.
8. Language barriers: Older adults who are not fluent in English may face language barriers within the legal system, which can affect their ability to understand legal procedures and communicate effectively with legal professionals.
9. Lack of familiarity with legal processes: Older adults may be less familiar with legal processes and procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
10. Limited transportation options: Older adults may have limited mobility or transportation options, which can make it difficult for them to attend legal proceedings or access legal services.
