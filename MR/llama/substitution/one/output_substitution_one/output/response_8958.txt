Promoting the social inclusion of working-class communities that are not expecting social mobility can be a complex and multifaceted task. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Empowerment through Education: Providing access to quality education is key to promoting social inclusion. This can include programs that focus on literacy, math, and other essential skills, as well as vocational training and apprenticeships that can help individuals acquire marketable skills.

This can be achieved through initiatives such as business loans, mentorship programs, and training and capacity-building activities.
3. Community Development: Building strong, cohesive communities is essential for promoting social inclusion. This can involve initiatives such as community clean-up events, cultural festivals, and other activities that bring people together and foster a sense of belonging.
