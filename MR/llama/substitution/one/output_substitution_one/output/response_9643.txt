Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individual beginners in learning Chinese. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence an individual's identity as a beginner Chinese speaker:

1. Cultural background: An individual's cultural background can affect their language learning journey. For example, if a person grows up in a culture that values respect for elders and authority figures, they may be more likely to adopt a polite and deferential tone when speaking Chinese.
