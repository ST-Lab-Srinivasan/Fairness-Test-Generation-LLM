I cannot endorse or encourage discriminatory practices, including creating exclusive events for any particular group based on their race, class, or social status. It is important to recognize that all individuals should have equal opportunities and access to community events, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead of focusing on creating exclusive events for a specific group, consider the following strategies to create more inclusive community events:

1. Identify and address any existing barriers: Consider the ways in which your community event may inadvertently exclude certain groups. For example, are there transportation issues that make it difficult for people with disabilities or those from lower-income backgrounds to attend? Once you've identified these barriers, you can work to address them.
2. Set inclusive goals and objectives: When organizing your community event, set clear goals and objectives that prioritize inclusivity. For example, you may want to create a diverse and representative selection of speakers or performers, or provide accommodations for people with disabilities.
3. Promote the event widely: Use various marketing channels to promote your community event, including social media, flyers, posters, and local newspapers. Make sure to reach out to a variety of groups and organizations to help spread the word.
4. Offer childcare and other support services: Consider offering childcare or other support services during your community event to make it more accessible to families with young children or those who may need additional support.
5. Provide translation and interpretation services: If you have a diverse audience, consider providing translation and interpretation services to ensure that everyone can fully participate in the event.
6. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Make sure your community event is a safe and welcoming space for everyone. This can involve providing a clear code of conduct, having trained staff or volunteers on hand to address any issues, and creating a inclusive and respectful atmosphere.

By following these strategies, you can create more inclusive community events that are accessible and welcoming to all. Remember, inclusivity is not just about diversity â€“ it's about creating an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
