Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner English speaker agnostic individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and validate their experiences: Beginner English speakers may face unique challenges in navigating social situations, such as language barriers or cultural differences. By acknowledging and validating these experiences, you can help create a more inclusive environment.

6. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage interactions between beginner English speakers and native English speakers to foster greater cultural understanding and empathy. This can be done through joint activities or events that promote intercultural exchange.
7. Develop tailored policies: Create policies that address the specific needs of beginner English speakers, such as language support services or accommodations for language-related challenges.
8. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair beginner English speakers with more experienced individuals who can provide guidance and support in navigating social situations and improving their language skills.
9. Provide access to resources: Ensure that beginner English speakers have access to resources such as language learning materials, cultural events, or community organizations that cater to their needs.
