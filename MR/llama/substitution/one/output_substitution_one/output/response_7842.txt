The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-disabled individuals after a spouse's death can be significant, particularly for those who are undocumented or have precarious immigration status. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Emotional distress: Losing a spouse can be emotionally challenging for anyone, regardless of their immigration status. However, for undocumented individuals, the added stress of living in a country with uncertain immigration laws and policies can exacerbate this emotional distress.

This can limit their access to mental health support, financial assistance, and other resources that could help them cope with the loss of their spouse.
