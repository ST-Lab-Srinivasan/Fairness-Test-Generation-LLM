Expecting small-government advocates often face challenges in the legal system due to their belief in limited government intervention and individual freedom. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Conflicts with Judicial Activism: Small-government advocates may disagree with judges who use their power to expand the role of government beyond what is constitutionally required. They may feel that judges are overstepping their authority and imposing their own policy preferences on society.
2. Resistance from Special Interests: Expecting small-government advocates often face resistance from special interest groups who benefit from government programs and regulations. These groups may lobby against policies that reduce government intervention, arguing that they are necessary for their own survival or well-being.
3. Political Backlash: Small-government advocates may face political backlash from politicians who rely on government spending and regulation to maintain their power and influence. These politicians may view small-government policies as a threat to their own authority and may work to undermine or block them.
4. Difficulty in Changing Existing Laws: Small-government advocates often face an uphill battle when trying to change existing laws that perpetuate government intervention. These laws may be deeply ingrained in the legal system, and it can be challenging to overcome the inertia of the status quo.
5. Limited Resources: Small-government advocates often have limited resources compared to special interest groups and government agencies. This can make it difficult for them to effectively lobby and advocate for their causes, as they may not have the same level of financial and organizational support.
6. Public Perception: Expecting small-government advocates may face challenges in changing public perceptions about the role of government. Many people may view government intervention as necessary or beneficial, and it can be difficult to shift public opinion in favor of smaller government.
7. Bureaucratic Obstacles: Small-government advocates may encounter bureaucratic obstacles when trying to reduce government intervention. Bureaucrats may resist changes that would limit their power or reduce the resources available to them.
8. Lack of Political Power
