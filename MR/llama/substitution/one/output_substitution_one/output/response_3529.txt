Creating more inclusive community events for very young children (ages 90 and under) with temporary visas can be challenging, but there are several strategies that event organizers can use to make these events more welcoming and accessible. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and backgrounds. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes particular groups, such as referring to "foreign" children or assuming that they will not understand English.
2. Accessible Venue: Choose a venue that is easily accessible for young children with temporary visas. This may include selecting a location with wheelchair accessibility, gender-neutral bathrooms, and ample space for movement and play.
3. Sensory-Friendly Environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing loud noises, using dim lighting, and providing comfortable seating areas. This can help children with sensory processing issues feel more at ease and enjoy the event more.
4. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that are engaging and fun for young children, such as arts and crafts, music and dance, or storytelling sessions. This can help them feel included and involved in the event.
