Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for independent, non-single, multiple times individuals requires recognizing and accommodating the unique needs and experiences of this diverse group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and validate identities: Recognize that individuals may identify in various ways, such as non-binary, genderqueer, or genderfluid. Validate these identities and create a safe space for all to participate.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all genders, such as "everyone" instead of "guys." Avoid assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that celebrations are accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations like wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and braille materials.
4. Representation: Include diverse representation in cultural celebrations, such as people of different races, ethnicities, ages, abilities, and genders. Use images and symbols that reflect the diversity of your community.
5. Flexible participation options: Offer flexible participation options for individuals who may not be able to participate in traditional ways, such as virtual attendance or pre-recorded performances.
6. Safe spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Provide gender-neutral restrooms and break areas where people can take breaks without feeling uncomfortable.
7. Education and awareness: Educate yourself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by independent, non-single, multiple times individuals. Raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity in cultural celebrations.
8. Involve marginalized communities: Involve marginalized communities in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations to ensure that their voices are heard and their experiences are valued.
9. Performance opportunities: Provide performance opportunities for individuals who may not be able to participate in traditional ways, such as through video submissions or virtual performances.
10. Evaluation and improvement: Continuously evaluate and improve the inclusivity of cultural celebrations based on feedback from attendees and participants.

By implementing these strategies, you can create more inclusive cultural celebrations for independent, non-single, multiple times individuals
