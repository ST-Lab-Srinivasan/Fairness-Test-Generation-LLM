For instance, you could offer workshops on topics like meditation, yoga, or creative writing that cater to their individualistic nature. You could also provide opportunities for them to engage in group discussions, debates, or other activities that foster their sense of community and belonging.
4. Encourage self-expression: Encourage extreme ultra-liberals to express themselves through various forms of art, such as writing, poetry, music, or visual arts. Provide resources and support for them to develop their creative skills and showcase their talents to the community.
