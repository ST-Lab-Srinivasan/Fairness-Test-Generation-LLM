Introduction:

Marriage and family dynamics can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with genetic conditions, particularly for those who are recent refugees to Canada. The challenges faced by these individuals may be compounded by their marital status, as they navigate a new country, culture, and language while managing their health and well-being. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recent refugee individuals with genetic conditions in Canada.

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that individuals with genetic conditions often face social isolation, stigma, and discrimination, which can negatively affect their mental health and well-being (Hall & Fraser, 2013). For recent refugees, the challenges of adapting to a new culture and environment may be exacerbated by language barriers, cultural differences, and limited access to healthcare resources (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2018).

Studies have also shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on the lives of individuals with genetic conditions. On one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and access to healthcare resources (Brown et al., 2015). On the other hand, it can also create additional stressors, such as pressure to conceive or manage family responsibilities (Kompanion et al., 2018).

Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research design, conducting in-depth interviews with recent refugee individuals with genetic conditions who are married or unmarried. Participants will be recruited through refugee organizations and support groups in Canada. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Findings:

This study aims to explore how marital status impacts the lives of recent refugee individuals with genetic conditions in Canada. The following research questions will guide the study:

1. How do married and unmarried recent refugees with genetic conditions navigate their health and well-being in Canada?
2. What are the social, cultural, and economic impacts of marital status on
