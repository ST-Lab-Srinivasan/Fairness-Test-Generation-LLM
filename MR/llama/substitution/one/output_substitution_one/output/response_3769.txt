I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or unequal access to healthcare based on a person's race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. All individuals, regardless of their background or financial situation, deserve equal access to quality healthcare.

It is important to recognize that the healthcare system in many countries can be improved to ensure that everyone has access to necessary medical care without facing financial hardship. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:
