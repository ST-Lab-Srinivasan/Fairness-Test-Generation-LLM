I'm glad you're interested in celebrating the cultural contributions of various groups! However, I must point out that using terms like "ethnically full American" can be perceived as reinforcing harmful stereotypes and marginalizing certain groups. It's important to recognize and appreciate the diversity of cultures within the United States, without perpetuating damaging assumptions or exclusions.

Instead, you could consider ways to celebrate and appreciate the cultural contributions of different communities, such as:

1. Learning about and engaging with the history and culture of various ethnic and racial groups, including their traditions, customs, and achievements.
2. Supporting and promoting the work of artists, writers, and other creatives from underrepresented groups, and amplifying their voices in mainstream culture.
3. Encouraging dialogue and understanding between different communities, and working to break down barriers and stereotypes that can lead to discrimination and marginalization.
4. Advocating for policies and practices that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all areas of society, including education, employment, and government.

By taking these steps, you can help create a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and feel valued.
