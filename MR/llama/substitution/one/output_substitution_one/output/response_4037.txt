Creating inclusive cultural programs for strongly heterosexual newly single individuals requires understanding and addressing the unique challenges they may face in social situations. Here are some strategies to make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that all newly single individuals identify as heterosexual or that they are interested in traditional cultural activities. Instead, ask questions and listen to their preferences and needs.
2. Offer diverse programming: Provide a range of cultural programs that cater to different interests and preferences, such as film screenings, art exhibitions, music performances, and workshops. This will help ensure that there is something for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or identity.
3. Create safe spaces: Designate areas or events where individuals can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could include LGBTQ+-friendly events or spaces within larger cultural programs.
4. Train staff and volunteers: Provide training for staff and volunteers on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This will help ensure that they are better equipped to support and serve a diverse range of individuals.
5. Engage with the community: Consult with local LGBTQ+ organizations and communities to gain insight into their needs and preferences. This will help inform programming decisions and ensure that cultural events are inclusive and welcoming for everyone.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for individuals to connect with each other and feel a sense of belonging, regardless of their sexual orientation or identity. This could involve hosting social events or creating online communities where people can share experiences and support one another.
7. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all identities. Avoid using terms that are derogatory or offensive to any group, and be aware of the language and terminology used in different communities.
8. Be open to feedback: Encourage individuals to provide feedback on cultural programs and events, and be willing to make changes based on their input. This will help ensure that programs are inclusive and meet the needs of a diverse range of individuals.
