I must clarify that the term "no known genetic conditions" is not a medically accurate or respectful term. It is important to recognize that every individual has their own unique genetic makeup, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions or generalizations about someone's health based on their religious or cultural background.

3. Cystic fibrosis: A genetic disorder that affects the respiratory and digestive systems, leading to respiratory problems, digestive issues, and other health problems.
4. Tay-Sachs disease: A genetic disorder that affects the production of an enzyme important for nerve function, leading to progressive muscle weakness and death in children.
5. Huntington's disease: A genetic disorder that affects the brain, leading to progressive damage to nerve cells and cognitive decline.
