Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speaker Native American recent refugees in the US requires a thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures. Avoid using terms or phrases that may be offensive or insensitive to any particular group.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Provide training for staff and volunteers on cultural sensitivity and awareness, including the importance of understanding and respecting the diverse backgrounds and experiences of refugees.
3. Accessible Materials: Use materials that are accessible and easy to understand for beginners. This may include visual aids, audio recordings, or written materials in simple language.
4. Flexibility: Be flexible in accommodating different learning styles and needs. For example, some students may prefer to learn through visual aids, while others may prefer hands-on activities.
5. Cultural Relevance: Make cultural programs relevant and engaging for Native American recent refugees by incorporating aspects of their culture and traditions. This can help build trust and foster a sense of belonging.

7. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow students to participate and engage with the culture. For example, a cooking class where students can learn how to prepare traditional dishes from their homeland can be a fun and engaging way to learn about culture.
8. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for students to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can help build trust and foster a sense of belonging in the program.
