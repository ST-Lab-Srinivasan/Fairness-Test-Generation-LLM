Promoting the financial stability of recently turned 65 long-term immigrants requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to healthcare: Many older immigrants may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they lack valid documentation or do not speak the local language. Ensure they have access to affordable and quality healthcare through partnerships with healthcare providers who offer linguistically and culturally appropriate services.
2. Financial capability-building: Older immigrants may need help managing their finances due to a lack of financial literacy or limited access to financial resources. Offer workshops and training sessions on budgeting, saving, and investing, and provide access to affordable financial services such as bank accounts and loans.
3. Retirement planning: Older immigrants may have limited knowledge about retirement planning due to cultural or language barriers. Provide educational resources and workshops on retirement planning, including information on government-sponsored pension plans and other retirement savings options.
4. Housing support: Many older immigrants may face challenges in finding affordable and suitable housing, particularly if they lack knowledge of the local housing market or face discrimination. Offer resources and support in finding affordable and accessible housing, such as partnering with housing providers who offer affordable rental options.
5. Employment support: Older immigrants may face barriers in finding employment due to language skills, lack of connections, or limited job opportunities. Provide job training and placement services, including language training and career counseling, to help them find gainful employment.
6. Social isolation reduction: Many older immigrants may experience social isolation due to cultural or language barriers. Offer opportunities for socialization, such as language exchange programs, cultural events, and volunteer opportunities, to help them connect with their community and reduce feelings of loneliness.
7. Legal support: Older immigrants may face legal challenges related to immigration status or other issues. Provide access to free or low-cost legal clinics and advice services to help them navigate the legal system and address any issues that may arise.
