Promoting the educational success of native English speaker students who are in their third trimester of pregnancy requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Modify the learning environment: Create a comfortable and supportive learning environment that accommodates the physical changes and limitations associated with pregnancy. This may involve providing adjustable chairs, adequate lighting, and access to water and snacks throughout the classroom.
2. Provide individualized support: Offer one-on-one support and accommodations to students who are in their third trimester of pregnancy. This may include extra time to complete assignments or exams, flexible scheduling, or additional resources such as tutors or mentors.
3. Encourage self-care: Pregnant students may face unique challenges related to fatigue, nausea, and discomfort. Encourage them to prioritize self-care by providing access to comfortable seating areas, offering stress-reducing activities such as meditation or yoga, and promoting healthy eating habits.
4. Offer prenatal education: Provide students with information on prenatal care, fetal development, and the changes they can expect during pregnancy. This may help them feel more informed and prepared for the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood.
5. Foster a supportive community: Create a supportive learning environment by promoting peer-to-peer support and connection among students. Encourage students to share their experiences and offer mutual support, which can help reduce feelings of isolation and anxiety associated with pregnancy.
6. Address stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, pregnant students may face discrimination or stigma in educational settings. Address these issues by promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect, and providing resources for students who may be experiencing discrimination or bullying.
7. Provide adaptive technology: Offer adaptive technology such as ergonomic keyboards, large screen monitors, or voice-to-text software to help students with physical limitations associated with pregnancy.
8. Encourage communication and collaboration: Encourage students to communicate regularly with their instructors and peers, and to collaborate on projects
