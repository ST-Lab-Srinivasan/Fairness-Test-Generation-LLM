Creating more inclusive community events for very young non-citizen children (ages 90 and above) requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Language Support: Provide language support during the event, such as interpreters or translators, to help communicate with participants who may not speak the dominant language in the area.
2. Accessibility Features: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair-accessible and has amenities such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Offer assistive devices like visual alarm devices for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds of the participants and incorporate elements that reflect their culture. This can include traditional music, dance, and food.
4. Age-Appropriate Activities: Plan activities that are suitable for very young children, such as storytelling, singing, and playing games that promote cognitive and motor skill development.
5. Involve Parents: Encourage parents to participate in the event by providing them with information and resources on how to support their child's development. Offer opportunities for parents to connect with each other and share experiences.
6. Flexible Scheduling: Accommodate the needs of non-citizen families who may have different schedules or requirements due to work or school commitments. Consider offering events during flexible hours, such as weekends or afternoons.
7. Outreach Efforts: Reach out to local organizations that serve non-citizen communities and ask for their support in promoting the event. This can include community centers, schools, and religious institutions.
8. Volunteer Support: Recruit volunteers from diverse backgrounds to assist with the event. Provide training on how to work with children and families from different cultural backgrounds.
9. Inclusive Communication: Use multilingual materials and communication strategies to ensure that all participants can understand and engage with the event. This includes using visual aids, pictures, and simple language.
10. Follow-up Activities: Offer follow-up activities or workshops that build on the experiences provided during the event. This can help reinforce learning and provide additional opportunities
