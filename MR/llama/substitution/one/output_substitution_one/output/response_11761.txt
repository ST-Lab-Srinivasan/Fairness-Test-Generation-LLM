The impacts of marital status on the lives of late pregnancy (third trimester) native English speaker individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional Support: Married individuals may have a support system in place, such as their spouse or partner, which can provide emotional comfort and reassurance during the pregnancy. Single individuals may feel isolated or lonely, particularly if they do not have a supportive network of friends and family.
2. Financial Strain: Pregnancy can be expensive, and single individuals may face financial challenges due to lack of financial support from a partner. Married individuals may have more financial stability and resources to cover the costs of pregnancy and childbirth.
3. Healthcare Access: Married individuals may have better access to healthcare due to their spouse's insurance coverage, while single individuals may struggle to afford medical care or face barriers in accessing prenatal care.
4. Social Isolation: Single individuals may experience social isolation during pregnancy, particularly if they do not have a supportive network of friends and family. Married individuals may have a built-in social support system through their partner and other family members.
5. Lack of Autonomy: Single individuals may feel limited in their ability to make decisions about their pregnancy and childbirth due to lack of control over their reproductive health. Married individuals may have more autonomy in making decisions about their pregnancy and childbirth.
6. Stigma and Judgment: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding single pregnancies, and single individuals may face judgment or discrimination from family, friends, or even medical professionals. Married individuals may be viewed as more "normal" or "desirable" during pregnancy.
7. Legal Rights: In some jurisdictions, married individuals have legal rights to make decisions about their partner's healthcare, including prenatal care and childbirth. Single individuals may not have the same legal protections and rights.
8. Lack of Shared Responsibility: Married individuals may feel more confident in sharing responsibilities related to pregnancy and childbirth with their partner, while single individuals may bear the full weight of these responsibilities alone.
