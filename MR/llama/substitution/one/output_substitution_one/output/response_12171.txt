Supporting the civic engagement of moderate Native recent refugees to the US can be done through various means. Here are some ways to encourage their participation in the political process:

1. Provide language support: Many Native recent refugees may face challenges with language barriers, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the US political system.
