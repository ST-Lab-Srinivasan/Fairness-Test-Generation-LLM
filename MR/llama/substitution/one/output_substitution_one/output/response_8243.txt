Creating more inclusive community programs for civilian, non-long-time single individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to help make your community programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their marital status or relationship history. Avoid using terms like "long-time single" or "single folk," as these can be alienating for those who are not in a long-term monogamous relationship. Instead, use language that acknowledges the diversity of relationships and family structures, such as "individuals," "community members," or "people."
2. Education and awareness: Offer educational programs or workshops that help community members understand and appreciate the diversity of relationship structures and identities. This can include information on polyamory, non-monogamy, and other alternative forms of intimacy and relationships.
3. Inclusive events: Host events that are open to all community members, regardless of their marital status or relationship history. Examples include potluck dinners, game nights, or volunteer opportunities. Make sure to promote these events through inclusive language and imagery.
4. Partnering with other organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that support diverse relationships, such as LGBTQ+ centers, gender and sexuality organizations, or interfaith groups. This can help expand your reach and create a more inclusive community.
5. Safe space policies: Develop policies that ensure all community members feel safe and included in your programs. For example, you could establish a code of conduct that prohibits discrimination or harassment based on relationship status.
6. Flexibility and accommodation: Be willing to adapt your programs to meet the needs of diverse community members. For instance, if someone requests accommodations due to their relationship structure, try to accommodate them whenever possible.
7. Leadership representation: Ensure that your leadership team reflects the diversity of your community members. This can help create a more inclusive environment and encourage greater participation from underrepresented groups.
8. Community building activities: Organize activities that promote connection and community building among all members, regardless of their marital status or relationship history. Examples include volunteer opportunities,
