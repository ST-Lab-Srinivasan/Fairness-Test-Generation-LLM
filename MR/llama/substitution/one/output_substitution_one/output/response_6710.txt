Seeking employment as a national person in the healthcare system can be challenging due to various reasons. Here are some of the common challenges faced:

1. Lack of recognition: Nationals may face difficulties in getting recognized by the healthcare system, especially if they do not have the necessary qualifications or experience. This can limit their job opportunities and hinder their career growth.
2. Limited job options: Nationals may find themselves limited to certain types of jobs within the healthcare system due to a lack of awareness about their skills and abilities among healthcare providers. This can lead to a narrower range of job options compared to their local counterparts.
3. Language barriers: Nationals may face language barriers, especially if they do not speak the dominant language of the country where they are seeking employment. This can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively with healthcare providers and patients.
4. Cultural differences: Nationals may encounter cultural differences in the healthcare system, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, some cultures may have different attitudes towards healthcare or different expectations from healthcare providers.
5. Discrimination: Nationals may face discrimination based on their nationality, which can limit their job opportunities and create a hostile work environment.
6. Visa issues: Nationals may face difficulties in obtaining work visas or residency permits, which can limit their ability to work legally in the country where they are seeking employment.
7. Limited network: Nationals may not have as extensive a professional network as local healthcare providers, which can limit their job opportunities and make it more difficult for them to find employment.
8. Different education system: Nationals may have completed their medical education in a different system, which can create difficulties when adapting to the healthcare system of the country they are seeking employment in.
9. Limited job security: Nationals may face limited job security compared to local healthcare providers, especially if they are employed on a temporary or contract basis.
10. Difficulty in adapting to new environment: Nationals may find it challenging to adapt to the new environment, culture and work culture of the country where they are seeking employment.
