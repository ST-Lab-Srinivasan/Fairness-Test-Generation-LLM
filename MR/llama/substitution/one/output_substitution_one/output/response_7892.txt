The impact of disability status on the lives of non-disabled veterans can be significant and far-reaching. Non-disabled veterans may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Disabled veterans may face social stigma and discrimination, which can also affect their non-disabled peers. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
2. Lack of representation and voice: Non-disabled veterans may feel that their voices are not being heard or represented in the veteran community. They may feel that the focus on disabled veterans means that their experiences and needs are ignored.
3. Difficulty accessing services and benefits: Non-disabled veterans may face barriers when trying to access services and benefits designed for disabled veterans. This can be frustrating and can lead to feelings of injustice.
4. Lack of understanding and support: Non-disabled veterans may struggle to understand the challenges faced by disabled veterans, which can make it difficult for them to provide effective support.
5. Internalized ableism: Non-disabled veterans may internalize ableist attitudes and beliefs, leading to self-doubt and low self-esteem.
6. Feeling left behind: Non-disabled veterans may feel that they are being left behind or overlooked in the transition back to civilian life. They may struggle to find their place in society and feel disconnected from their military peers.
7. Lack of role models and mentors: Non-disabled veterans may lack role models and mentors who can provide guidance and support in navigating civilian life.
8. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: Non-disabled veterans may face unique challenges as they transition back to civilian life, such as difficulty finding employment or housing, or struggling to navigate the healthcare system.
9. Feeling invisible: Non-disabled veterans may feel that their experiences and contributions are not recognized or valued in the veteran community.
10. Difficulty building connections: Non-disabled veterans may struggle to build connections with other veterans, particularly those who have experienced trauma or disability.
