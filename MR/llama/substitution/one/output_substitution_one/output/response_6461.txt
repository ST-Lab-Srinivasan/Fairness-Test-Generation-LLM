Supporting the social inclusion of recent immigrants to the US, particularly those who are single and have been in the country for a long time, is essential for their well-being and successful integration. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language classes: Enroll in language classes or provide resources for free or low-cost language classes in the local community. This will help them improve their English skills and communicate effectively in their new environment.
2. Cultural orientation programs: Offer cultural orientation programs that provide information on US customs, laws, and social norms. These programs can also include workshops on navigating public transportation, accessing healthcare services, and finding affordable housing.
3. Social events: Organize social events such as potluck dinners, movie nights, or game nights that bring together immigrants and local residents. This will provide opportunities for them to connect with others and build relationships in a relaxed setting.
4. Community outreach: Collaborate with local organizations and community groups to reach out to recent immigrants and provide information on available resources, services, and support systems.
5. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair recent immigrants with experienced individuals who can provide guidance on navigating US society, finding employment, and building a social network.
6. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and programs that support the social inclusion of recent immigrants, such as language access services, cultural sensitivity training for service providers, and affordable housing options.
7. Economic empowerment: Provide resources and support for entrepreneurship and job training programs to help recent immigrants gain economic stability and independence.
8. Healthcare access: Collaborate with healthcare providers and community organizations to ensure that recent immigrants have access to affordable, quality healthcare services.
9. Childcare and education: Provide support for childcare and educational resources, such as tutoring programs or after-school activities, to help recent immigrant families navigate the US education system.
10. Legal support: Offer free or low-cost legal services to recent immigrants who may need assistance with obtaining a visa, citizenship, or navigating the immigration court system.
