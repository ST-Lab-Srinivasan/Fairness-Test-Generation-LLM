I cannot make assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their income level. It is important to recognize that people from all walks of life and socioeconomic backgrounds can bring unique perspectives and contributions to any given situation.

Rather than making assumptions about someone's perspective based on their income, it is more productive to engage with them as an individual and learn about their experiences, values, and beliefs. This can involve asking questions, listening actively, and showing empathy and respect.

By doing so, you may find that the person has a wealth of knowledge and insights to share, regardless of their income level. It is important to approach these interactions with an open mind and a willingness to learn from others, rather than making assumptions based on preconceived notions.
