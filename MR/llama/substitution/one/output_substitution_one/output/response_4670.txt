I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question as it is subjective and can vary based on individual experiences and perspectives. However, I can offer some possible challenges that may be faced by not upper middle-income mixed Caucasian heritage people in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of cultural competency: The healthcare system may not always be culturally competent in addressing the needs of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those with mixed heritage.

2. Discrimination: Individuals from marginalized communities, including those with mixed heritage, may face discrimination in the healthcare system. This can include implicit bias, microaggressions, and overt discrimination, which can affect their access to care and overall health outcomes.
3. Language barriers: Individuals who are non-native English speakers or who come from communities with limited English proficiency may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, which can negatively impact their health outcomes.

8. Lack of tailored interventions: The healthcare system may not offer tailored interventions that address the specific needs and experiences
