6. Train staff on cultural sensitivity: Provide training for staff on how to interact with conservative Native Arabic speakers in a culturally sensitive manner. This can include learning about their customs, traditions, and communication styles.
7. Encourage dialogue and collaboration: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between different community groups to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can help build bridges between different cultural groups and create a more inclusive public space.
8. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services for conservative Native Arabic speakers who may not be fluent in the dominant language of the region. This can help them navigate public spaces more easily and feel more included.
9. Address safety concerns: Ensure that public spaces are safe and secure for conservative Native Arabic speakers, particularly those who may be vulnerable to harassment or discrimination. This can include providing separate entrances and exits, as well as increased security measures.
