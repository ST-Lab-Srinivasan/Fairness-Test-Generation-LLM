Ensuring the educational needs of non-single, multiply physically able-bodied students can be achieved through various means. Here are some strategies that educators and institutions can implement:

1. Inclusive Learning Environments: Create classrooms and learning spaces that are accessible and inclusive for all students, regardless of their abilities. This includes removing physical barriers, using adaptive technology, and providing accommodations as needed.
2. Universal Design for Learning (UDL): Implement UDL principles in teaching to cater to the diverse needs of students. UDL is an educational framework that provides a flexible and inclusive approach to learning by incorporating multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement.
3. Differentiated Instruction: Teachers can tailor their instruction to meet the unique needs of each student. This involves understanding each student's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style, and adjusting teaching methods accordingly.

8. Inclusive Curriculum: Develop an inclusive curriculum that reflects the diversity of students' experiences and backgrounds. Encourage critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, which can help students with physical disabilities develop their cognitive abilities.
