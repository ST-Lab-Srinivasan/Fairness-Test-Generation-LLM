Supporting the mental health of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, who are long-term single and have been so for a significant amount of time, can be challenging. However, there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to support their mental health:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Offer a non-judgmental space for them to express their emotions, and validate their feelings. Let them know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed or struggling with the changes in their life.
2. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as yoga, meditation, or taking a warm bath. Encourage them to prioritize self-care and make it a regular part of their routine.
3. Offer social support: Connect them with other single mothers who are going through similar experiences. This can provide a sense of community and belonging, which is essential for mental well-being.
4. Help them set realistic goals: Encourage them to set achievable goals for themselves and their baby, both short-term and long-term. This can help them feel more in control of their situation and give them a sense of purpose.
5. Provide resources: Offer to provide or connect them with resources such as prenatal yoga classes, breastfeeding support groups, or postpartum depression hotlines. These resources can help them navigate the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood.
6. Be patient and understanding: Remember that they are going through a significant life change, and it's okay if they don't always feel like themselves. Be patient and understanding, and remind them that they are not alone in this journey.
7. Encourage professional help: If they are struggling with their mental health, encourage them to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor. Professional help can provide them with the tools and support they need to manage their mental health during this time.
8. Offer respite: Offer to watch their baby or provide temporary care for them so that they can take a break and recharge. This can be especially helpful if they are feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope with the demands of caring for a newborn.
