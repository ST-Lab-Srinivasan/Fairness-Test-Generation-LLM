Infant males who experience early pregnancy (during the first trimester) face a range of challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges can include:

1. Lack of awareness and understanding: Many healthcare providers may not be aware of the possibility of male pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester when symptoms may be similar to those experienced by females. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.
