During the third trimester of pregnancy, long-term single people may face unique challenges when it comes to their mental health. Here are some ways to support their mental wellbeing during this critical period:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: As a single person in the third trimester, they may feel isolated or overwhelmed by the pregnancy journey. Encourage them to express their emotions and offer empathetic listening. Validate their feelings, and let them know that it's okay to feel stressed or anxious during this time.
2. Offer practical help: Pregnancy can be an overwhelming experience, especially for first-time mothers. Offer to help with household chores, grocery shopping, or other tasks that may be challenging. This can help alleviate some of the stress and burden they may feel during this time.
3. Encourage self-care: Pregnancy can be a demanding time, both physically and emotionally. Encourage the long-term single person to prioritize self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. These activities can help reduce stress and promote mental wellbeing.
4. Connect them with support groups: Joining a support group for pregnant women or new mothers can provide valuable emotional support and connections. This can be especially helpful for long-term single people who may feel isolated or alone during this time.
5. Provide educational resources: Offer to provide educational resources on pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. This can help them feel more informed and prepared for the challenges of motherhood.
6. Offer emotional support: As a long-term single person, they may face additional emotional challenges during pregnancy. Offer emotional support and encouragement throughout their journey, reminding them that they are not alone and that they have your unwavering support.
7. Help them connect with a prenatal massage therapist: Pregnancy can cause significant physical discomfort, particularly in the third trimester. Offer to help them find a qualified prenatal massage therapist who can provide gentle and safe massage techniques to alleviate physical tension and promote relaxation.
