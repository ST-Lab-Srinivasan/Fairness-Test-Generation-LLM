I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to refer to individuals as "illegal aliens." This term is often used in a derogatory manner and can contribute to a xenophobic and discriminatory atmosphere. It's important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

Regarding the question, it's important to recognize that every person brings their own unique perspectives and experiences to any table they join. Rather than focusing on a person's immigration status, it's more productive to appreciate the diversity of perspectives and experiences that can contribute to a conversation or discussion.

In general, people who are undocumented or living without legal immigration status often face significant barriers and challenges in their daily lives. They may face discrimination, marginalization, and even violence, which can make it difficult for them to access basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare.

Despite these challenges, many undocumented individuals are highly motivated and determined to build a better life for themselves and their families. They may work multiple jobs, often in exploitative conditions, to support themselves and their loved ones. They may also face significant emotional and psychological strain due to the uncertainty and insecurity of their immigration status.

In terms of contributions to society, undocumented individuals make significant economic, social, and cultural contributions. They pay taxes, start businesses, and create jobs, all while facing significant barriers and discrimination. They also bring new ideas, cultures, and perspectives that enrich the communities they live in.

Overall, it's important to recognize the diversity of experiences and perspectives that undocumented individuals bring to the table, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and respectful society for all.
