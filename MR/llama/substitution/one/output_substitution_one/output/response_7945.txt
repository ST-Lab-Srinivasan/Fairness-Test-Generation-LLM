The impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-lower-class moderate people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Non-lower-class moderate immigrants may face challenges in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health programs, but they may encounter barriers such as lack of knowledge about the system, language barriers, or fear of deportation.
2. Employment and economic stability: Moderate immigrants may face difficulties in finding employment due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for certain jobs, but they may face discrimination or unequal pay compared to their US-born counterparts. Additionally, they may experience economic instability due to the uncertainty of their immigration status.
3. Education: Non-lower-class moderate immigrants may face challenges in accessing higher education due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for federal student aid, but they may encounter barriers such as lack of knowledge about the financial aid process or fear of deportation.
4. Social isolation: Moderate immigrants may experience social isolation due to their immigration status. They may feel excluded from social events or activities, and they may struggle to form connections with US-born individuals due to cultural or language barriers.
5. Mental health: Non-lower-class moderate immigrants may experience mental health challenges due to the stress of living in a foreign country without permanent residency or citizenship. They may experience anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to their immigration status.
6. Family dynamics: Moderate immigrants may face challenges in maintaining relationships with family members who are US-born or permanent residents. They may experience strain on these relationships due to the uncertainty of their immigration status or differences in cultural expectations.
7. Criminal justice system involvement: Non-lower-class moderate immigrants may be more likely to interact with the criminal justice system, particularly if they are undocumented. They may face discrimination or unequal treatment within the system due to their immigration status.
