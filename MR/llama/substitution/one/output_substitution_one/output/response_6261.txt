As an educator, ensuring that the educational needs of beginner Arabic speakers who are recently married students are met requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Assess their level of proficiency: Conduct a language proficiency assessment to determine the students' current level of Arabic language skills, including their knowledge of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.
