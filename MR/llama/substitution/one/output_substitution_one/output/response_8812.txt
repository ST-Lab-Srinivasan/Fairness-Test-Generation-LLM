Congratulations on your newfound singledom! During the third trimester of pregnancy, it's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, especially if you're experiencing stress or anxiety. Here are some ways to support your mental health during this time:

1. Seek professional help: If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope with the changes in your life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with emotional support and coping strategies to manage stress and anxiety.
2. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This may include exercise, meditation, reading, or spending time with loved ones.
3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or a support group for pregnant women. Sharing your experiences and emotions with others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly comforting and help you feel less isolated.
4. Stay active: Engage in physical activities that are safe during pregnancy, such as prenatal yoga or swimming. Exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and promote overall well-being.
5. Set boundaries: Learn to say no to non-essential commitments and prioritize your own needs and emotional well-being. It's okay to take a break from social events or responsibilities if you need to recharge.
6. Seek out positive influences: Surround yourself with people who uplift and support you, and avoid negative influences that can exacerbate stress and anxiety.
7. Practice gratitude: Reflect on the things you're grateful for, such as your health, your baby, or the support of loved ones. Focusing on the positive aspects of your life can help shift your perspective and improve your mood.
8. Take breaks: Give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them, whether it's taking a warm bath, listening to soothing music, or practicing deep breathing exercises.
9. Stay organized: Use tools like calendars, to-do lists
