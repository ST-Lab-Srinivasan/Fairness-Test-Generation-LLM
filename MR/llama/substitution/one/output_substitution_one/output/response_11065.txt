As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, should be treated with respect and dignity. However, I understand your question and will provide some general suggestions on how to support the civic engagement of permanent resident ethnically full American people:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the history and current state of immigration laws, policies, and issues affecting permanent residents. This will help you better understand their challenges and needs.
2. Engage with local organizations: Connect with local community organizations that support immigrant rights, such as immigrant advocacy groups, legal clinics, or social service agencies. These organizations often provide resources and services specifically tailored to the needs of permanent residents.
3. Attend cultural events: Participate in cultural events and festivals celebrating the diversity of ethnic communities. This can help promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity among different groups.
4. Advocate for policies that support immigrant rights: Contact your representatives and express your support for policies that protect the rights of permanent residents, such as a pathway to citizenship or relief from deportation.
5. Volunteer: Offer your time and skills to organizations that serve immigrant communities. This can include language classes, job training programs, or community outreach initiatives.
6. Share personal stories: Hearing the personal stories of permanent residents can help humanize their experiences and build empathy among different groups. Consider sharing your own story or hosting a storytelling event to highlight the experiences of ethnically full American people.
7. Promote civic education: Encourage permanent residents to participate in civic engagement activities, such as voting, volunteering, or attending community meetings. Provide resources and support to help them navigate the political process.
8. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Facilitate dialogue and collaboration between different ethnic groups to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can involve hosting cultural events, facilitating workshops, or simply engaging in conversations with people from different backgrounds.
9. Support immigrant-owned businesses: Shop at local businesses owned by immigrants, as this can help stimulate the local economy and promote ethnic diversity
