As a temporary visa holder, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Limited access to legal aid: As a temporary visa holder, you may not be eligible for free or low-cost legal aid services. This can make it difficult for you to find affordable legal representation, particularly if you have a complex legal issue.
2. Unfamiliarity with the legal system: The legal system in Australia can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. As a temporary visa holder, you may struggle to navigate the legal system and understand your rights and obligations.
3. Language barriers: If you do not speak English fluently, you may face challenges communicating with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals. This can make it difficult for you to fully understand the legal process and make informed decisions about your case.
4. Lack of control over legal proceedings: As a temporary visa holder, you may have limited control over the legal proceedings related to your case. For example, you may not be able to choose your lawyer or control the timing of court hearings.
5. Uncertainty about the outcome of legal proceedings: As a temporary visa holder, you may face uncertainty about the outcome of legal proceedings and how they will affect your future in Australia. This can cause stress and anxiety, particularly if you are facing potential deportation or other negative consequences.
6. Limited access to social services: As a temporary visa holder, you may have limited access to social services such as healthcare, housing, and employment support. This can make it difficult for you to access the resources you need to support yourself and your family during legal proceedings.
7. Discrimination and stigma: Unfortunately, some people in Australia may hold negative attitudes towards temporary visa holders. As a result, you may face discrimination or stigma, which can make it difficult for you to access legal services and feel supported during the legal process.
8. Difficulty navigating multiple legal systems: If you are dealing with multiple legal issues related to your temporary visa status, you may find it challenging to navigate different legal systems and understand how they interact.
9. Limited knowledge of legal rights and responsibilities
