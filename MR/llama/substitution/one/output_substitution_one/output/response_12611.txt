Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Native Arabic Speaking Ultra-Democrats

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and values of individuals and communities worldwide. In the case of native Arabic speaking ultra-democrats, cultural heritage is particularly important as it influences their political beliefs, social behaviors, and cultural practices. This research paper aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in the lives of native Arabic speaking ultra-democrats, focusing on its impact on their identity, values, and political beliefs.

Literature Review:
The literature on cultural heritage and its relationship with political beliefs is vast and diverse. Some scholars argue that cultural heritage can act as a source of inspiration for political activism and social change (Haller, 2013). Others suggest that cultural heritage can be used to justify existing power structures and maintain the status quo (Gamson, 1992). However, there is limited research on the specific role of cultural heritage in the lives of native Arabic speaking ultra-democrats.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with native Arabic speaking ultra-democrats living in the Middle East and North Africa. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. The interviews will focus on participants' experiences of cultural heritage and its impact on their political beliefs, values, and identity. Data will be analyzed thematically, using an inductive approach to identify patterns and categories.

Expected Findings:
This study is expected to provide new insights into the role of cultural heritage in the lives of native Arabic speaking ultra-democrats. Specifically, it is anticipated that participants will highlight the following themes:

1. Cultural heritage as a source of political inspiration: Participants may discuss how their cultural heritage has inspired them to engage in political activism and fight for social justice.
