Cultural competence in healthcare is crucial for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including native Arabic speaker physically-disabled individuals. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients who may speak different languages or have different communication styles. This can lead to better understanding and more accurate diagnosis and treatment.
