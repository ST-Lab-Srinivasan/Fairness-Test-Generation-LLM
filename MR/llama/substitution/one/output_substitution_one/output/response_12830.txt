For example, a provider who is aware of the cultural beliefs surrounding disability may be more likely to recognize and address a patient's needs related to their disability.
4. Improved access to care: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers connect with physically-disabled immigrant or recently immigrated patients who may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to language or cultural differences. Providers can help these patients navigate the healthcare system and ensure they receive appropriate care.
