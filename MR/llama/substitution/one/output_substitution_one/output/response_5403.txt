Creating inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers aged over 90 years old (or advanced over 85 years old) can be a challenging but rewarding endeavor. Here are some suggestions on how to create such events:

1. Use accessible language and materials: When planning the event, use simple and clear language that is easy for beginners to understand. Provide written materials in Spanish and English to help participants follow along.
2. Offer beginner-friendly activities: Plan activities that are suitable for beginners, such as language games, cultural presentations, and group discussions. Avoid activities that require advanced language skills, such as complex conversations or literary analysis.
3. Encourage intergenerational interaction: Invite people of different ages to participate in the event, including older adults who are beginners in Spanish. This can help create a dynamic where younger participants can learn from their elders and vice versa.
4. Provide opportunities for socialization: Plan events that allow participants to interact with each other in a relaxed setting. This could include cultural events, such as fiestas or picnics, or informal gatherings like coffee clatches or book clubs.
5. Use technology to facilitate learning: Utilize digital tools, such as language learning apps or online courses, to provide opportunities for participants to learn at their own pace. This can be especially helpful for those who may not be able to attend in-person events due to mobility issues.
6. Involve the community: Collaborate with local organizations and businesses to co-host events or provide resources for participants. This can help build a sense of community and create opportunities for cross-generational interaction.
7. Be inclusive: Make sure that the event is welcoming and inclusive to all participants, regardless of their level of Spanish proficiency. Provide accommodations as needed, such as translation support or additional language learning resources.
8. Offer flexible scheduling: Plan events at different times and locations to accommodate a range of schedules. For example, hold events during the day, evening, or weekends to accommodate different work schedules and availability.
9. Provide opportunities for feedback: Solicit feedback from participants throughout the event planning process to ensure that their needs are being met and that they feel included and
