I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "monastic Hindu native French speaker people" is a bit ambiguous and may not accurately represent a specific group or community. Monks and nuns are individuals who have dedicated their lives to spiritual practices and living in a religious community, regardless of their cultural or linguistic background.

However, if you are looking for ways to support the social inclusion of individuals from diverse backgrounds within a Hindu monastery or spiritual community, here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage diversity and inclusivity: Foster an environment of respect, empathy, and understanding among all members of the community, regardless of their cultural or linguistic background. Promote inclusive practices and policies that ensure everyone feels valued and involved.
2. Provide language support: For native French speakers who may be less proficient in other languages spoken within the monastery, offer language classes or interpretation services to facilitate communication.
3. Celebrate cultural events: Organize events that celebrate the diverse cultural traditions of the community members, such as festivals, workshops, or lectures. This can help build bridges between different cultures and foster a sense of shared identity.
4. Offer mentorship programs: Pair newcomers with experienced members of the community who can provide guidance and support in navigating the monastery's rules, customs, and practices.
5. Create opportunities for socialization: Organize social events or gatherings that bring together community members from different backgrounds, such as potlucks, game nights, or volunteer activities.
6. Provide access to resources: Ensure that all community members have access to the resources they need to thrive, including language learning materials, cultural event listings, and support services.
7. Encourage active listening: Teach community members the skill of active listening, which involves fully concentrating on what the other person is saying, without interrupting or judging. This can help build trust and understanding between individuals from different backgrounds.
8. Develop cultural competence training: Offer workshops or training sessions that teach community members about different cultures and how to interact with people from diverse backgrounds.
9. Foster intergenerational relationships: Encourage older and younger community members to connect and learn from
