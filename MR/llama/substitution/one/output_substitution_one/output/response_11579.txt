I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality, including the economic empowerment of a specific racial or ethnic group at the expense of others. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, deserve equal opportunities and resources to thrive and succeed.

It is important to recognize that the concept of an "upper middle class" is subjective and can be defined and experienced differently by various individuals and communities. Moreover, it is not appropriate to imply that any particular racial or ethnic group is inherently more deserving of economic empowerment than others.

Instead, I suggest focusing on strategies that promote equitable access to resources and opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and inequalities, such as discrimination, unequal access to education and job training, and limited economic mobility.

Some potential strategies for promoting equitable economic empowerment include:

1. Investing in education and job training programs that provide opportunities for individuals from underrepresented groups to acquire new skills and advance in their careers.
2. Implementing policies and practices that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, such as targeted hiring initiatives and mentorship programs.
3. Providing financial support and resources to individuals and communities that have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged, such as low-income families, people of color, and indigenous communities.
4. Advocating for policies that address systemic inequalities and promote greater economic mobility, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing initiatives, and social safety nets.

Ultimately, the goal should be to create a more equitable and inclusive society where all individuals have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
