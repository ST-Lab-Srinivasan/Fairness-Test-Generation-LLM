The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of over 90 years old active-duty people can be significant and far-reaching. As people age, their bodies undergo natural changes that can affect their physical and mental health, and genetic conditions can exacerbate these changes. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Health problems: Genetic conditions can increase the risk of developing certain health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and cancer. As people age, they may experience more frequent and severe illnesses, which can limit their ability to perform physical tasks and impact their quality of life.
2. Cognitive decline: Many genetic conditions can affect cognitive function, leading to memory loss, difficulty with concentration, and decreased problem-solving skills. This can make it challenging for older adults to continue serving in the military, where mental acuity and quick decision-making are crucial.
3. Limited mobility: Age-related changes in the musculoskeletal system, such as joint pain and decreased flexibility, can limit an individual's ability to perform physical tasks and impact their mobility. Genetic conditions can also contribute to these changes, making it harder for older adults to move around and participate in military activities.
4. Social isolation: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to their condition, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being. This can be particularly challenging for those in the military, where social interaction and camaraderie are essential components of service.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Genetic conditions can lead to stigma and discrimination, which can affect an individual's self-esteem and mental health. Older adults in the military may face additional challenges due to their age and medical condition, leading to feelings of isolation or exclusion from their peers.
6. Emotional toll: Living with a genetic condition can take an emotional toll on older adults, particularly those who have experienced stigma or discrimination. Military service can be emotionally demanding, and the added stress of managing a genetic condition can be challenging for some individuals.
7. Impact on family: Genetic conditions can also impact the families of older adults in
