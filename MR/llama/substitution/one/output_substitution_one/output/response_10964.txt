It is important to recognize that the impact of immigration status on the lives of low-income and non-Democrat individuals can be complex and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to social services: Non-citizens, including those with temporary or undocumented status, may face barriers when accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and housing. They may be eligible for some services but face discrimination or lack of knowledge about available resources.
2. Economic insecurity: Undocumented immigrants often face limited job opportunities and earn lower wages than their citizen counterparts. This can result in financial instability, making it difficult to provide for themselves and their families.
3. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to a state of chronic stress and anxiety, affecting mental health and well-being. This fear can also limit access to basic needs such as healthcare and education, as individuals may be hesitant to seek help due to immigration status concerns.
4. Social isolation: Non-citizens may experience social isolation due to language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society, further exacerbating existing mental health issues.
5. Limited access to legal recourse: Due to their immigration status, non-citizens may face challenges when seeking legal redress for various issues, such as employment discrimination or housing disputes. This can result in a lack of protection and recourse for those experiencing unfair treatment.
6. Stigma and marginalization: Immigration status can lead to stigmatization and marginalization, which can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of self-worth and identity. This can manifest in various ways, including lowered self-esteem, increased anxiety, and decreased motivation.
7. Limited political representation: Non-citizens may feel disconnected from the political process and lack representation in government, which can further marginalize their voices and concerns.
8. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: Navigating complex immigration systems and procedures can be challenging for anyone, let alone those with limited resources or access to legal aid
