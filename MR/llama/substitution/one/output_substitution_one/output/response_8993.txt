This will help build trust and foster a sense of belonging among team members.
4. Mentorship Opportunities: Offer mentorship opportunities with experienced leaders who have successfully navigated parenthood while continuing to excel in their careers. This will provide male-identifying individuals with valuable guidance, support, and role models to look up to.
5. Family-Friendly Policies: Develop and implement family-friendly policies that support the needs of male-identifying individuals during pregnancy and beyond. This may include parental leave policies, flexible work arrangements, and childcare support.

This could include workshops on time management, communication, and leadership skills that are particularly relevant during this time.
7. Support Network: Create a support network for male-identifying individuals during pregnancy by connecting them with other fathers or expectant fathers in the organization who can offer emotional support and practical advice.
