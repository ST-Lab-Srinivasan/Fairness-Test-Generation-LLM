Supporting recently arrived refugee communities, particularly those in the US, can be a challenging but rewarding endeavor. Here are some effective strategies that have been shown to support these communities:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Providing cultural competency training for service providers and community members can help build bridges between the refugee population and the broader community. This training can cover topics such as cultural norms, customs, and practices, as well as the unique challenges faced by refugees.
