Creating more inclusive community programs for active-duty long-term single individuals requires understanding their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to help create more inclusive programs:

1. Understand the needs of long-term singles: Conduct research or gather input from long-term singles to identify their specific needs, such as social isolation, lack of support networks, or difficulty finding affordable housing.
