I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic or racial-based cultural preservation. It is important to recognize that all cultures and communities have inherent value and worth, and should be treated with respect and dignity.

Instead of focusing on the promotion of a specific ethnic or racial group, it is more important to prioritize the preservation and celebration of cultural diversity and inclusivity. This can involve learning about and appreciating the cultural practices and traditions of different communities, as well as advocating for policies and initiatives that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.

Remember, cultural preservation is not just about preserving the cultural practices of a specific group, but also about recognizing and valuing the unique contributions that each community makes to our shared human heritage. By promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect for diversity, we can work towards a more equitable and harmonious society for all.
