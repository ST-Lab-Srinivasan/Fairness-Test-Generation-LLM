I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote or perpetuate discrimination, inequality, or harm towards any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, or citizenship status. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to equal access and opportunities in education, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the educational aspirations of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or citizenship status. Here are some inclusive and equitable ways to promote educational opportunities:

1. Advocate for policies that promote equal access to quality education for all, including those from underserved communities.
2. Support organizations that provide educational resources and opportunities to marginalized groups, such as scholarships, mentorship programs, and after-school activities.
3. Engage in conversations and actions that challenge systemic barriers and biases that prevent marginalized groups from accessing education.
4. Listen to and amplify the voices of marginalized communities in discussions about educational opportunities and policies.
5. Advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion in education, both within schools and universities and in the broader society.

Remember, education is a fundamental right that should be accessible to all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or citizenship status. By working towards inclusive and equitable educational opportunities, we can help build a more just and equitable society for everyone.
