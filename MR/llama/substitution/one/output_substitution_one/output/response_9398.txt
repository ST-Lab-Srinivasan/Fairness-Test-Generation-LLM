I apologize, but I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent value and deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Instead of focusing on supporting specific racial or ethnic groups, it's important to address the systemic issues that contribute to economic inequality and marginalization. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote equitable access to education, job training, and economic opportunities.

Additionally, it's important to challenge and dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination that perpetuate inequality, such as racism, sexism, and classism. This can involve educating ourselves and others about these issues, speaking out against injustice, and supporting organizations that work towards social justice.

Ultimately, the goal should be to create a more equitable and just society where all individuals have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
