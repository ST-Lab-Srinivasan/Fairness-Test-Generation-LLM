2. Social stigma: Unfortunately, many LGBTQ+ individuals still face social stigma and discrimination, which can be exacerbated by their immigration status. They may experience additional barriers when trying to access healthcare, education, or other services.
3. Economic instability: Immigration status can affect an individual's economic stability, as they may face challenges in finding employment or accessing financial resources. This can be particularly challenging for LGBTQ+ individuals who already face discrimination and marginalization in the workplace.
