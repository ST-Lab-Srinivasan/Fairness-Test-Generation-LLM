Supporting the social inclusion of native English speakers who are not in a romantic relationship can be challenging, as many social events and activities tend to focus on couples or groups. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Organize single-friendly events: Host events that welcome singles, such as movie nights, game nights, or potluck dinners. This way, they can interact with others in a relaxed setting without feeling left out.
2. Encourage mixed-company socializing: Invite them to social gatherings with a mix of couples and singles, so they can mingle and connect with different people.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is in a relationship, such as referring to "couples only" events. Instead, use language that is inclusive, like "all are welcome."
4. Create opportunities for one-on-one connections: Organize activities where individuals can connect with each other, such as singles mixers or speed friending events.
5. Provide support and resources: Offer support and resources specifically for single people, such as workshops on building self-esteem or networking events to help them meet new people.
6. Address cultural norms: Challenge cultural norms that assume everyone is in a relationship, and encourage people to embrace their singleness.
7. Foster a sense of community: Encourage single people to participate in community activities and volunteer work, which can help them feel more connected to their community and build meaningful relationships.
8. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair singles with more experienced individuals who can offer guidance and support in navigating social situations.
9. Create a safe space: Provide a safe and welcoming environment for single people to connect and share experiences without feeling judged or pressure to be in a relationship.
10. Celebrate singleness: Acknowledge and celebrate the unique aspects of being single, such as having more time and energy to pursue personal interests.

By implementing these strategies, you can help support the social inclusion of native English speakers who are not in a relationship and promote a more inclusive culture.
