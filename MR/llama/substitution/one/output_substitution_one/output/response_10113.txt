I must emphasize that promoting inclusion and diversity in any aspect of life, including sports, should be done in a way that respects and values the identity and culture of all individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to promote the inclusion of devout Muslim ethnic minority American individuals in professional athletics:

1. Provide educational resources: Offer workshops, training sessions, or online materials that educate coaches, athletic directors, and other sports professionals about the cultural and religious practices of devout Muslims. This can help them understand and accommodate the needs of these individuals in their athletic programs.
2. Create a supportive environment: Foster an inclusive atmosphere in sports organizations where Muslim athletes feel comfortable expressing their beliefs and practicing their religion without fear of discrimination or stigma. This can involve setting up prayer rooms or flexible scheduling for religious practices during games or training sessions.
3. Encourage mentorship: Pair Muslim athletes with experienced coaches or mentors who understand their cultural and religious backgrounds. These mentors can provide guidance, support, and advocacy to help the athletes navigate any challenges they may face in their sports careers.
4. Develop inclusive policies: Develop and implement policies that promote diversity and inclusion in sports organizations. This can include anti-discrimination policies that protect Muslim athletes from discrimination based on their religion, as well as policies that support their participation in religious practices during games or training sessions.
5. Highlight success stories: Share the stories of successful Muslim athletes who have overcome challenges to achieve their goals in sports. This can help inspire and motivate other Muslim athletes to pursue their passions and reach their full potential.
6. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance or scholarships to Muslim athletes who may face additional barriers to participation due to economic constraints. This can help level the playing field and ensure that all talented athletes have equal opportunities to succeed.
7. Build partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support diversity and inclusion in sports, such as the National Football League's (NFL) Inclusivity and Diversity Department or the Women's Sports Foundation. These partnerships can provide valuable resources and expertise to help promote the inclusion of Muslim athletes in professional sports.
