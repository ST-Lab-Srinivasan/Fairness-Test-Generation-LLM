Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are experiencing deep poverty, especially those who have been single and multi-times, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and provides support for these individuals to improve their economic stability and well-being. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Address systemic issues: Poverty is often caused by systemic issues such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources and opportunities. Policymakers must address these underlying issues through policies that promote equity and inclusion.
2. Provide access to education and job training: Education and job training programs can help individuals acquire new skills and knowledge that can lead to better-paying jobs and improved economic stability.
3. Increase access to affordable housing: Affordable housing can provide a stable living environment for individuals and families, which is essential for breaking the cycle of poverty. Policymakers can create incentives for developers to build more affordable housing units or provide subsidies for low-income households.
4. Improve healthcare access: Ensuring access to quality healthcare can help individuals manage chronic conditions and avoid unnecessary medical expenses that can push them deeper into poverty. Policymakers can expand Medicaid coverage, increase funding for community health clinics, or provide financial assistance for low-income households.
5. Provide mental health support: Poverty can have a significant impact on mental health, and individuals who are experiencing deep poverty may need additional support to manage stress and anxiety. Policymakers can provide funding for mental health services or create programs that address the emotional and psychological needs of low-income individuals.
6. Encourage community involvement: Building a strong social safety net requires involvement from the entire community. Policymakers can encourage community members to volunteer their time or donate resources to organizations that support low-income individuals.
7. Offer financial assistance: Providing financial assistance, such as cash transfers or vouchers, can help individuals cover basic needs like food, clothing, and housing. Policymakers can also offer subsidies for transportation costs, childcare expenses, or other necessities that can help individuals get back on their feet.
