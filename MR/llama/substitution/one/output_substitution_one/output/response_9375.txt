Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deep-in-poverty Mexican people are met is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that could be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: Deep-in-poverty populations often face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of providers in their area. Increasing the number of community health workers, mobile clinics, and telemedicine services can help bridge these gaps and improve access to care.
2. Improve health literacy: Many deep-in-poverty individuals may lack the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complex healthcare system or make informed decisions about their health. Providing culturally appropriate health education materials, workshops, and training programs can help improve health literacy and empower individuals to take charge of their health.
3. Address social determinants of health: Poverty, lack of access to nutritious food, inadequate housing, and limited opportunities for education can all have a profound impact on an individual's health. Addressing these social determinants through community-based programs and policies can help improve overall health outcomes.
4. Build partnerships between healthcare providers and local organizations: Collaborating with local organizations that serve deep-in-poverty populations, such as food banks, schools, and community centers, can help identify unmet health needs and develop targeted interventions to address them.
5. Incorporate a trauma-informed approach: Many individuals living in poverty have experienced trauma, which can impact their mental and physical health. Implementing trauma-informed care practices, such as training healthcare providers in cultural competency and sensitivity, can help create a safe and supportive environment for these individuals.
6. Focus on prevention: Addressing the root causes of poverty and social determinants of health through policy changes and community-based interventions can help prevent illnesses and injuries before they occur. This can include initiatives to improve access to affordable housing, education, and job training.
7. Leverage technology: Telemedicine, mobile health applications, and other digital health techn
