Creating more inclusive recreational activities for permanent residents in the upper-upper middle-income group can be achieved by considering their unique needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help make recreational activities more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that recreational facilities and activities are accessible to all, regardless of physical ability. This can include providing ramps, elevators, and adaptive equipment for people with disabilities.
2. Variety of activities: Offer a range of recreational activities that cater to different interests and preferences. For example, offer sports, arts, music, dance, and other activities that appeal to different segments of the population.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in marketing materials and communication to avoid alienating any group. Avoid using language that assumes a specific gender or socio-economic status.
4. Scholarships and financial assistance: Provide scholarships or financial assistance to help make recreational activities more accessible to people from lower-income backgrounds.
5. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and partnership with local organizations to promote diversity and inclusion in recreational activities.
6. Cultural sensitivity: Be culturally sensitive when designing recreational activities that cater to diverse communities. For example, be mindful of religious or cultural practices that may affect participation.
7. Inclusive programming: Develop programming that caters to the unique needs and interests of different groups. For example, develop sports programs that cater to people with disabilities or older adults who may have different fitness needs.
8. Partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve diverse communities to promote recreational activities and provide access to underrepresented groups.
9. Education and training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included.
10. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism that allows participants to provide input on their experiences and suggestions for improvement, ensuring that recreational activities are inclusive and cater to the needs of all groups.

By implementing these strategies, recreational facilities and activities can become more inclusive and appealing to a wider range of people, including those from upper-upper
