Ensuring that the voices of native Spanish speakers, including recent refugees to the US, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and social justice. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create opportunities for participation: Organizations and institutions should provide opportunities for native Spanish speakers and recent refugees to participate in decision-making processes. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, community meetings, or other forms of outreach.
2. Build trust and rapport: It is essential to build trust and rapport with the community before expecting them to participate in decision-making processes. This can be achieved by establishing long-term relationships, providing culturally sensitive services, and demonstrating a commitment to their well-being.
3. Provide language support: Many native Spanish speakers may not be fluent in English, which can create barriers to participation. Providing language support, such as interpreters or translated materials, can help ensure that everyone has equal access to information and decision-making processes.
4. Use culturally appropriate methods: Decision-making processes should be adapted to the cultural context of the community being served. This may involve using traditional forms of communication, such as oral storytelling, or incorporating cultural practices into the decision-making process.
5. Foster collaboration and partnership: Collaboration with local organizations, community groups, and other stakeholders can help ensure that the voices of native Spanish speakers are heard in decision-making processes. By working together, organizations can pool their resources and expertise to better serve the needs of the community.
6. Advocate for policy change: Organizations can advocate for policies that promote the inclusion of native Spanish speakers in decision-making processes. This may involve working with government agencies, non-profit organizations, or other stakeholders to push for changes in laws and regulations.
7. Provide training and education: Offering training and educational programs can help native Spanish speakers develop the skills and knowledge they need to participate effectively in decision-making processes. This may involve teaching leadership skills, civic engagement, or other forms of professional development.
8. Use technology to facilitate participation: Technology can be used to facilitate participation from remote locations or to reach underserved communities
