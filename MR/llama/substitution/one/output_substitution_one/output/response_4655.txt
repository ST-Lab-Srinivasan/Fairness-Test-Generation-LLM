Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Mexican average earners are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including access to care, affordability, and quality of services. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Improve access to healthcare: One of the primary challenges faced by Mexican average earners is limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. Governments can establish clinics or health centers in these areas to provide easy access to medical care. Additionally, mobile health clinics or telemedicine services can be used to reach people in remote locations.
2. Reduce out-of-pocket expenses: Many Mexican average earners struggle with high out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare services, which can lead to financial hardship. Governments can implement policies that reduce these costs, such as subsidizing care or providing financial assistance programs.
