I must emphasize that creating cultural celebrations that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations, is essential. It is important to recognize that cultural celebrations should be a time for community building and bringing people together, rather than promoting divisive ideologies.

That being said, here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for right-leaning separated individuals:

1. Understand and respect individual beliefs and values: It is crucial to understand that each person has their own set of beliefs and values, and it is important to respect those differences. Avoid making assumptions about individuals based on their political beliefs or affiliations.
2. Involve a diverse group of people in the planning process: Involving a diverse group of people in the planning process can help ensure that the cultural celebration is inclusive and representative of all individuals. This can include people from different backgrounds, cultures, and political beliefs.
3. Focus on shared values and traditions: Rather than focusing on political differences, focus on the shared values and traditions that bring people together. This can help create a sense of community and inclusivity.
4. Avoid politically charged language or imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups of people. Instead, use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals.
5. Provide accommodations for different beliefs and practices: Be mindful of the diverse beliefs and practices of individuals, and provide accommodations where necessary. For example, if someone does not eat meat, make sure there are vegetarian options available.
6. Encourage open dialogue and mutual respect: Encourage open dialogue and mutual respect among all individuals involved in the cultural celebration. This can help create a sense of community and inclusivity.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of any power dynamics at play during the cultural celebration, and work to address any issues that may arise. For example, if there are those who hold more power or influence than others, make sure to give all individuals a voice and an equal opportunity to participate.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultures, beliefs, and practices that exist
