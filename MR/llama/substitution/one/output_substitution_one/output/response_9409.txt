The protection of legal rights for non-conservative devout Hindus in India is essential to ensure their ability to practice and express their religion freely without fear of discrimination or persecution. Here are some ways to protect the legal rights of non-conservative devout Hindus:

1. Constitutional guarantees: The Indian Constitution provides for the right to freedom of religion under Article 25(1).
