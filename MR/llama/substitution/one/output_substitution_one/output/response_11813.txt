Promoting the educational success of recent refugees in Canada, particularly those who are pregnant or have young children, can be challenging but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some recommendations:

1. Provide language support: Many recent refugees may struggle with the English language, which can make it difficult for them to succeed in school. Offer language support programs, such as ESL (English as a Second Language) classes or tutoring, to help them improve their language skills.
2. Address cultural barriers: Refugees may come from different cultures and backgrounds, which can affect their educational experience. Provide cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff to help them understand the needs of diverse students and create an inclusive learning environment.
3. Foster a welcoming environment: Create a welcoming atmosphere in schools by promoting diversity and inclusion. Encourage students to share their experiences and cultures, and provide opportunities for them to connect with peers from different backgrounds.
4. Offer individualized support: Refugees may have experienced trauma or loss, which can impact their academic performance. Provide individualized support, such as counseling or mentoring, to help them cope with these challenges and succeed in school.
5. Connect them with resources: Refugees may face many challenges outside of school, such as finding housing, accessing healthcare, and navigating social services. Connect them with local organizations that provide support for these needs, which can help reduce stress and improve their overall well-being.
6. Provide flexible learning options: Many recent refugees may have irregular schedules or conflicting responsibilities due to their family situation. Offer flexible learning options, such as online courses or part-time study, to help them balance their academic and personal obligations.
7. Celebrate their contributions: Refugees bring unique perspectives and experiences to their communities. Celebrate their contributions and achievements in school events, assemblies, or exhibitions to promote a sense of belonging and motivation.
8. Advocate for policy changes: Advocate for policies that support the educational success of refugee students, such as increased funding for language support services, cultural sensitivity training for teachers, and flexible learning options.
9. Collaborate with community organizations:
