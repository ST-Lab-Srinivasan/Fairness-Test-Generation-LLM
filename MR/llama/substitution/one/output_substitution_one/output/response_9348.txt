Title: Inclusive Support for Non-Democratic Early Pregnancy Athletes

Introduction:
Early pregnancy (within the first trimester) is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life, particularly for professional athletes. While there are various support systems in place for pregnant athletes, those who experience non-democratic early pregnancy may face additional challenges. This essay aims to explore ways to promote the inclusion of non-democratic early pregnancy individuals in professional athlete populations.

A. Definition and prevalence
Non-democratic early pregnancy refers to instances where an individual becomes pregnant without their consent or through coercive means, such as rape or incest. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1 in 5 women worldwide have experienced sexual and reproductive rights violations, including forced pregnancy.
B. Health risks and challenges
Non-democratic early pregnancy can lead to various health complications, such as miscarriage, premature birth, and low birth weight. The individuals affected may also experience emotional distress, social stigma, and limited access to prenatal care and support services.

Professional athletes face additional challenges when experiencing non-democratic early pregnancy, including:
1. Stigma and discrimination
Athletes may be subject to negative attitudes and behaviors from teammates, coaches, and fans due to the perceived "inconvenience" or "burden" of their pregnancy.
2. Lack of support structures
Athletes may struggle to find adequate prenatal care, childcare options, and postpartum recovery resources within athletic settings.

Pregnant athletes may face pressure to terminate their pregnancy or risk losing their athletic career, due to the perceived impact on their sporting performance and reputation.
