I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or perpetuate discrimination or harm towards any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or immigration status. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status.

I would like to clarify that the term "not able-bodied nominal Hindu" is problematic as it can be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and discrimination against people based on their religion, race, or ethnicity. It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to provide helpful and accurate information.
