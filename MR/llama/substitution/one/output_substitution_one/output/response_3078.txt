1. Financial Planning and Budgeting: Encourage expectant mothers to create a comprehensive budget that accounts for the additional expenses that come with pregnancy, such as prenatal care, baby supplies, and maternity clothes.

2. Health Insurance: Ensure that the expectant mothers have adequate health insurance coverage to cover any medical expenses related to pregnancy, labor, and delivery. This can include purchasing a separate maternity insurance policy or adding a rider to their existing health insurance plan.
3. Emergency Fund: Encourage expectant mothers to create an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses that may arise during pregnancy, such as hospital bills or medical emergencies.
