Creating more inclusive cultural programs for strong Hindu individuals who are not high-income professionals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Make the cultural programs accessible to everyone, regardless of their income level. Offer scholarships or financial aid to those who cannot afford the program fees.

7. Cultural sensitivity: Be culturally sensitive when creating and presenting cultural programs. Avoid stereotyping or appropriating Hindu traditions without proper understanding or permission.
8. Education and training: Provide education and training to cultural program staff on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Encourage staff to engage in ongoing self-reflection and professional development.
9. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from community members on the cultural programs. Use this feedback to make improvements and ensure that the programs are inclusive and representative of diverse Hindu communities.
10. Community ownership: Encourage community members to take ownership of the cultural programs by involving them in the planning, implementation, and evaluation processes. This can help build trust and ensure that the programs are responsive to local needs and preferences.
