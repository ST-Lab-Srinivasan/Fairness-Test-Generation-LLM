Promoting the social inclusion of Native American communities that are deep in poverty requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and inequality. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Education and job training programs: Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help individuals gain the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and college scholarships.
2. Economic development initiatives: Encouraging economic development in poor Native American communities can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. This can be achieved through initiatives such as small business loans, entrepreneurship training, and infrastructure development.
3. Healthcare access: Improving access to healthcare can help address the physical and mental health challenges that are disproportionately affecting Native American communities. This can include mobile clinics, telemedicine services, and culturally sensitive healthcare programs.
4. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Preserving and revitalizing Native American cultural practices can help promote a sense of identity and belonging. This can involve language and cultural immersion programs, traditional arts and crafts workshops, and cultural festivals.
5. Community leadership development: Developing the leadership skills of community members can help build capacity and promote community-based initiatives. This can involve training programs, mentorship opportunities, and leadership development workshops.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocating for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels can help address systemic issues that contribute to poverty and inequality in Native American communities. This can involve working with elected officials, participating in advocacy campaigns, and building coalitions with other marginalized groups.
7. Addressing historical trauma: Historical trauma has had a profound impact on the social and economic well-being of Native American communities. Addressing this trauma through mental health services, cultural healing programs, and community-based initiatives can help promote healing and resilience.
8. Community-based initiatives: Implementing community-based initiatives that are led by and benefit the local community can help build trust and promote social inclusion. This can involve initiatives such as food banks, housing assistance programs, and community gardens
