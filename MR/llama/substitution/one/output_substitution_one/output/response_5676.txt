To ensure that the educational needs of male-identifying students who are actively and fully embracing their gender identity are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Provide access to gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that there are gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, and other facilities available for students who may feel uncomfortable using facilities that do not align with their gender identity.
2. Use inclusive language and materials: Use language and materials that are inclusive of all genders and avoid binary language that assumes only male or female identities.
3. Encourage self-expression: Create a safe space for students to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage students to share their gender identity and expression with others, and provide support and resources for those who may be questioning their gender identity.
4. Offer gender-neutral clothing options: Provide gender-neutral clothing options in the school store or at school events, such as t-shirts, hoodies, or other clothing items that do not perpetuate gender binaries.
5. Train staff and faculty: Provide training for staff and faculty on gender diversity, inclusive language, and how to support students who are gender diverse.
6. Establish a gender support group: Create a safe space for students who are questioning their gender identity or who are actively and fully embracing their gender identity to meet and share their experiences with peers and mentors.
7. Involve students in decision-making: Involve male-identifying students in the decision-making process around issues that affect them, such as school policies and events.
8. Provide access to mental health resources: Provide access to mental health resources for students who may be struggling with their gender identity or expression, including counseling and therapy services.
9. Create a welcoming environment: Foster a welcoming and inclusive environment at the school by promoting respect, empathy, and understanding of gender diversity.
10. Celebrate gender diversity: Celebrate and recognize the diversity of gender identities and expressions through events, assemblies, or other initiatives that promote inclusivity and respect for all genders.
