As a happy and newly single individual with extreme soft libertarian views, I would like to emphasize that my personal beliefs and values should be taken into account when responding to disasters. Here are some suggestions on how to address the needs of happily newly single extreme soft libertarians in disaster response:

1. Respect for Personal Property: As a libertarian, I believe that individuals have the right to own and control their personal property. In the event of a disaster, it is important to respect this right and not confiscate or take control of private property without proper compensation.
2. Voluntary Assistance: Rather than relying on forced or coercive means of response, consider using voluntary assistance as the primary method of providing aid. This can include organizing local volunteers, partnering with non-profit organizations, and leveraging community resources to provide effective support.
3. Decentralized Organization: As a libertarian, I believe in the power of decentralized organization and decision-making. In disaster response, this means allowing communities and local organizations to take the lead in organizing relief efforts, rather than relying on centralized authorities.
4. Property Rights Protection: As a soft libertarian, I believe that property rights should be protected during disaster response efforts. This includes respecting the right of individuals to protect their property from damage or looting, and ensuring that any necessary searches or seizures are carried out with proper compensation and due process.
5. Limited Government Intervention: While some may argue for a more active role for government in disaster response, I believe that limited intervention is generally the most effective approach. This means avoiding unnecessary regulations or restrictions on individual activity, and instead relying on market forces and community organizations to provide support.
6. Focus on Reconstruction: Rather than solely focusing on immediate relief efforts, consider shifting the focus towards long-term reconstruction and recovery. This can involve investing in infrastructure and economic development projects, as well as supporting local businesses and entrepreneurs to help rebuild communities.
7. Community Engagement: As a libertarian, I believe that community engagement and participation are essential for effective disaster response. This means involving local residents in decision-making processes, and encouraging them to take an active role
