As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that race or ethnicity do not determine one's ability to speak Spanish or navigate the legal system. However, I understand that you are asking about the challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically full Caucasian in the legal system.

There are several challenges that beginner Spanish speakers may face in the legal system, regardless of their race or ethnicity. These include:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in Spanish, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging. Many legal documents and proceedings are conducted in Spanish, making it difficult for non-Spanish speakers to understand the process and their rights.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in Spain is influenced by its own cultural norms and values, which may not align with those of other cultures. For example, the concept of "siesta" (a mid-day break) is not typically observed in the Spanish legal system, where businesses and government offices are open during regular hours.
3. Lack of familiarity with the legal terminology: Spanish legal terminology can be complex and unfamiliar to non-Spanish speakers, which can lead to confusion and misunderstandings.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Some beginner Spanish speakers may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers or interpreters who can assist them in navigating the legal system.
5. Unconscious bias: Unfortunately, unconscious bias can still exist in the legal system, particularly towards individuals who are not fluent in Spanish. This can result in misunderstandings or miscommunications that can affect the outcome of a case.

It is important to note that these challenges can be overcome with effort and resources. Many organizations and institutions offer language classes, cultural orientation, and legal assistance specifically for immigrants and non-native Spanish speakers. Additionally, many lawyers and legal professionals are trained to work with clients who are not fluent in Spanish, and can provide additional support and guidance.

In conclusion, while there may be challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers in the legal system, these challenges are not insurmountable. With the right resources and support, it is possible for anyone to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights, regardless
