Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including beginner French speakers who are recent refugees to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these individuals:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients who may have different communication styles or language barriers.
