Promoting the Educational Success of Formerly Newly Single Gender-Nonconforming Students:

Introduction:
Educational institutions play a vital role in promoting the academic success of students, including those who identify as formerly newly single gender-nonconforming (FSGNC). These students may face unique challenges due to their gender identity or expression, which can impact their educational experience. This paper discusses the strategies and practices that educational institutions can adopt to promote the educational success of FSGNC students.

Understanding FSGNC Students:
FSGNC students are individuals who were previously identified as male or female based on their biology but now identify as non-binary, genderqueer, or a different gender entirely. These students may experience gender dysphoria, which can result in distress and impaired academic performance. It is essential to recognize that FSGNC students have the right to express their gender identity freely and without fear of discrimination or marginalization.

Creating Inclusive Environments:
To promote the educational success of FSGNC students, educational institutions must create inclusive environments where these students feel valued and supported. This can be achieved by implementing the following strategies:

1. Gender-neutral policies and practices: Educational institutions should develop gender-neutral policies and practices that respect and recognize the diversity of gender identities. This can include using gender-neutral language, avoiding gendered assumptions or expectations, and providing gender-neutral options for students' preferred names and pronouns.
2. Safe spaces: Educational institutions should create safe spaces where FSGNC students can express themselves without fear of harassment or discrimination. This can include designated gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, or other gendered spaces.
3. Training for staff and faculty: Educational institutions should provide training for staff and faculty on how to support FSGNC students, including understanding their experiences and challenges, and recognizing the importance of creating inclusive environments.
4. Support services: Educational institutions should offer support services specifically designed for FSGNC students, such as counseling or mental health resources, to help them navigate any challenges they may face due to their gender identity.
