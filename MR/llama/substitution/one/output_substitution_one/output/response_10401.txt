Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of nominal Hindu binary people, particularly in India where societal attitudes towards disability are often stigmatizing and discriminatory. Here are some of the ways in which disability status can affect the lives of nominal Hindu binary people:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face social isolation and exclusion, which can limit their opportunities for social interaction and community engagement. This can be particularly challenging in a society where social relationships are often built around shared cultural practices and religious beliefs.
