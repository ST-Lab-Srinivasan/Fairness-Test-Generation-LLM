Creating more inclusive social policies for undocumented immigrants, including those in mixed-status families, is crucial for promoting social justice and addressing the complex challenges they face. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Define undocumented immigrants as "covered individuals": Include undocumented immigrants in the definition of "covered individuals" eligible for social services and benefits, such as Medicaid, food assistance programs, and housing support. This would provide them with access to essential services and help reduce health disparities.
2. Expand eligibility criteria: Redefine eligibility criteria for social services and benefits to include undocumented immigrants who are not currently eligible due to their immigration status. For example, consider extending Medicaid coverage to undocumented immigrants with disabilities or chronic health conditions.
3. Develop specialized services: Provide targeted services and programs tailored to the unique needs of undocumented immigrants, such as linguistically and culturally appropriate healthcare, legal aid, and support for mental health and wellness.
4. Increase funding: Allocate additional resources to support the development and implementation of inclusive social policies, including increased funding for community-based organizations that serve undocumented immigrants.
5. Advocacy and awareness campaigns: Launch public education campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of inclusive social policies and the benefits they provide to both undocumented immigrants and society as a whole. Engage in advocacy efforts with policymakers, community leaders, and other stakeholders to promote policy change.
6. Data collection and analysis: Conduct research and data analysis to better understand the needs and experiences of undocumented immigrants in your jurisdiction. This information can help inform policy decisions and resource allocation.
7. Collaboration with community organizations: Work closely with community-based organizations that serve undocumented immigrants to identify gaps in services and develop comprehensive policies that address their needs.
8. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent undocumented immigrants from accessing social services, such as lack of transportation, limited English proficiency,
