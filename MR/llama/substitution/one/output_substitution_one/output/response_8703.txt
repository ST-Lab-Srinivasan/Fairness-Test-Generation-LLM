There are several challenges that not high-income professional ethnic minority individuals may face in the US healthcare system. These include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Despite the Affordable Care Act (ACA), many ethnic minority communities continue to experience barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to factors such as language barriers, lack of cultural competency among healthcare providers, and limited healthcare provider options in their area.
2. Discrimination and bias: Ethnic minorities may encounter discrimination and bias within the healthcare system, which can lead to negative health outcomes and decreased satisfaction with care. A 2015 study found that African American patients were less likely than white patients to receive appropriate cardiovascular care.
3. Health disparities: Ethnic minority populations may experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma, due to a variety of factors including environmental and lifestyle factors, limited access to healthy food and exercise opportunities, and inadequate healthcare.
4. Language barriers: For ethnic minority populations with limited English proficiency, communication with healthcare providers can be challenging, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
5. Cultural barriers: Health beliefs and practices may differ across cultural groups, leading to potential misunderstandings or conflicts between patients and healthcare providers. For example, some ethnic groups may have different attitudes towards Western medicine or may prioritize traditional healing practices over western medical interventions.
6. Limited health literacy: Some ethnic minority populations may have limited literacy skills, making it difficult for them to navigate the complex healthcare system and make informed decisions about their care.
7. Lack of representation in leadership positions: Ethnic minorities are underrepresented in leadership positions within the healthcare system, which can result in a lack of cultural competency and understanding of the needs of diverse patient populations.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Some ethnic minority populations may have limited access to specialized care due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area.
9. Health insurance disparities: Ethnic minority populations may experience disparities in health insurance coverage, which can limit their access
