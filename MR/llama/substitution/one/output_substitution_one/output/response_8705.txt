It is important to acknowledge that there are various challenges faced by non-high-income professional ethnic Caucasians in the healthcare system. While they may not face the same level of discrimination and marginalization as historically oppressed groups, such as people of color, they may still encounter barriers and biases within the healthcare system. Here are some of the challenges that non-high-income professional ethnic Caucasians may face:
