Addressing the Needs of Not Recently Single Independent Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disaster response and recovery efforts often focus on meeting the immediate needs of affected populations, including food, shelter, and medical care. However, there are also important considerations for not recently single independent individuals (NRSI) who may face unique challenges during and after a disaster. This article will explore how disaster responders can better address the needs of NRSI individuals, including those who identify as LGBTQ+ or have other underrepresented identities.

Understanding NRSI Individuals:
NRSI individuals are those who have been independent for at least six months and do not have a spouse or partner. This group may include young adults, seniors, or individuals who have chosen to remain independent due to various reasons such as personal beliefs, career goals, or financial independence. NRSI individuals may face specific challenges during disaster response and recovery, including:

1. Lack of representation: Disaster response efforts often prioritize families and children, leaving NRSI individuals feeling overlooked or underrepresented.
2. Limited access to resources: Depending on their living situation, NRSI individuals may struggle to access essential goods and services such as food, water, and medical care.
3. Social isolation: Disasters can disrupt social networks and support systems, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation among NRSI individuals.
4. Stigma and discrimination: NRSI individuals may face additional challenges due to their identity, including LGBTQ+ individuals who may face discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Addressing the Needs of NRSI Individuals:
To better address the needs of NRSI individuals during disaster response and recovery, consider the following strategies:

1. Inclusive messaging: Use language and messaging that acknowledges and includes NRSI individuals in disaster response efforts. This can help to reduce feelings of isolation and marginalization.
2. Accessible resources: Ensure that essential goods and services are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their living situation or identity. This may involve adapting distribution methods or providing additional support for those who need it.
3. Social support networks: Facilitate the creation and maintenance of social support
