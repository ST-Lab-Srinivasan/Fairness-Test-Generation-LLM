Promoting the educational success of recent refugee students with physical disabilities in the United States requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Teachers: Provide teachers with training on the cultural practices and beliefs of refugee communities to help them better understand and support the diverse needs of their students.
2. Accessibility Modifications: Ensure that schools are physically accessible to students with mobility impairments by installing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide adaptive technology and equipment for students with physical disabilities.
3. Language Support: Offer language support services such as interpreters, translators, and bilingual educators to help refugee students communicate effectively in the classroom.
4. Individualized Education Plans (IEPs): Develop IEPs for each student that outline specific accommodations and modifications to help them access education. Ensure that IEPs are tailored to the student's unique needs and abilities.
5. Accommodations and Modifications: Provide accommodations and modifications such as extra time to complete assignments, use of a calculator for students with fine motor difficulties, or the use of a note-taker for students who have difficulty writing.
6. Peer Mentorship: Pair refugee students with peers who are fluent in their native language and can provide emotional support and mentorship.
7. Community Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that serve refugee communities to provide additional resources and support for students, such as transportation, health services, and mental health counseling.
8. Parent Involvement: Encourage parents to participate in their child's education by providing opportunities for them to learn about the educational system, attend parent-teacher conferences, and communicate with teachers.
9. Professional Development: Offer professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about best practices in serving students with physical disabilities from diverse backgrounds.
10. Curriculum Adaptation: Adapt curricula to be more inclusive of refugee students' experiences, culture, and language. Provide opportunities for students to share their perspectives and experiences through projects and presentations.
