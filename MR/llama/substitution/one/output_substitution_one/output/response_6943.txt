Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are not recently married. Early pregnancy can be a challenging time for any woman, and immigration status can exacerbate these challenges. This study aims to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of people in their first trimester of pregnancy who are not recently married.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that immigration status can have a profound impact on an individual's mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic well-being (1-3). For example, studies have found that undocumented immigrants experience higher levels of stress and anxiety compared to documented immigrants (4). Additionally, unmarried immigrant women are more likely to experience sexual and reproductive health problems compared to their married counterparts (5).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, specifically thematic analysis, to explore the experiences of 18-35 year old not recently married individuals in their first trimester of pregnancy. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers that serve immigrant populations. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants, and data will be analyzed using thematic analysis.

Significance:
This study will provide valuable insights into the experiences of immigrant women in their first trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who are not recently married. The findings will shed light on the impacts of immigration status on mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic well-being during this critical time. The study's results can inform the development of targeted interventions and policies that address the specific needs of this population.

Conclusion:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of immigrant women in their first trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who are not recently married. This study will provide valuable insights into the experiences of these individuals and inform the development of targeted interventions and policies that address their specific needs.
