As a neutral AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "conservative beginner Chinese speaker" is quite broad and may encompass a wide range of individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. However, I will do my best to provide general information on the challenges faced by beginners in the legal system, without making any assumptions or stereotypes based on their political beliefs or language proficiency.

In China, there are several challenges that beginner Chinese speakers may face within the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: As a non-native Chinese speaker, it can be difficult to navigate the legal system in China, especially for those who are not fluent in Chinese. Many legal documents and proceedings are conducted in Mandarin, which can make it hard for beginners to understand and participate effectively.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique cultural context that may not be familiar to foreigners or non-native speakers. Understanding the local customs, traditions, and social norms is crucial for navigating the legal system successfully.
3. Lack of legal knowledge: Beginners in the Chinese legal system may lack knowledge about the country's laws, regulations, and judicial procedures. This can make it difficult to navigate the system and understand their rights and obligations.
4. Limited access to legal resources: In some areas of China, there may be limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or government agencies that provide legal assistance. This can further exacerbate the challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers in the legal system.
5. Gender and socioeconomic barriers: Women and marginalized groups may face additional challenges within the legal system, including discrimination, limited access to resources, and social stigma.
6. Lack of trust in the legal system: Beginners may have limited trust in the legal system due to past experiences or perceived biases, which can affect their ability to navigate the system effectively.
7. Limited legal literacy: Many beginner Chinese speakers may lack basic legal knowledge and skills, such as understanding court procedures, legal terminology, and how to interact with legal professionals.
8. Difficulty in finding legal aid: Finding legal aid or representation can be challenging
