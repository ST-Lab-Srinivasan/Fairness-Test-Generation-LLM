Creating more inclusive social policies for devout Hindu trans individuals requires a deep understanding of their experiences, challenges, and cultural context. Here are some recommendations:

1. Consult with the Transgender Community: The most important step is to consult with the transgender community in India, particularly those who identify as devout Hindus. This will help ensure that policies are tailored to their specific needs and experiences.
2. Recognize Gender Identity: Recognize that gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity, and that it is separate from their sex assigned at birth. This recognition is critical for creating inclusive policies that respect the identities of trans individuals.
3. Address Discrimination: Address the systemic discrimination faced by trans individuals in India, particularly those who are devout Hindus. This can be done by implementing anti-discrimination laws and policies that protect the rights of trans individuals.
4. Provide Access to Healthcare: Ensure that trans individuals have access to appropriate healthcare, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and gender-affirming surgeries. This is critical for their physical and mental well-being.
5. Create Inclusive Spaces: Create spaces that are inclusive of trans individuals, such as public restrooms and changing rooms. This can help reduce feelings of discomfort and marginalization.
6. Address Language Barriers: Address language barriers by providing translations and interpretations in the languages spoken by trans individuals. This will help ensure that they have access to information and services that are tailored to their needs.
7. Promote Education and Awareness: Promote education and awareness about gender identity and expression, particularly among devout Hindus. This can help reduce stigma and discrimination and promote a more inclusive society.
8. Support Networks: Support networks of trans individuals, including those who are devout Hindus. These networks can provide emotional support, advocacy, and other forms of assistance.
9. Advocate for Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and national levels to ensure that trans individuals are protected from discrimination and have access to the services they need.
10. Engage in Dialogue: Engage in dialogue
