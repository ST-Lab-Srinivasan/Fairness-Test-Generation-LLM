The impact of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) not single for a long time people can be significant, particularly in countries with strict immigration policies and laws. Here are some potential impacts:

6. Fear of Separation: Undocumented immigrants may experience fear of being separated from their partner or children, which can lead to anxiety and depression during pregnancy. This can also impact the mother's ability to access prenatal care and other resources.
7. Lack of Empowerment: Undocumented immigrants may feel a lack of empowerment and control over their lives due to their immigration status.
