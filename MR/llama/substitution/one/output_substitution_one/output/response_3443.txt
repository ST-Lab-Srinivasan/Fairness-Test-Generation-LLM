Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for late 30s native Caucasian speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these events more welcoming and representative of diverse communities:

1. Involve diverse planning committees: Ensure that the planning committee represents a diverse range of cultures, ages, genders, and backgrounds. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of different perspectives and needs.
2. Offer multilingual communication: Provide interpreters or translation services for attendees who may not speak the dominant language of the event. This can include sign language interpretation for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Incorporate diverse performers and entertainment: Book musicians, dancers, and other performers from diverse backgrounds to provide a more inclusive lineup. Consider featuring performances that highlight different cultures and traditions.
4. Provide accessible seating and accommodations: Ensure that the event venue is wheelchair accessible and has designated areas for individuals with accessibility needs. Offer assistive listening devices or captioning for attendees who may have difficulty hearing or seeing.
5. Offer a variety of food options: Provide a range of food options that cater to different dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian, gluten-free, and halal. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and able to participate in the celebration.
6. Create a safe space for marginalized communities: Designate specific areas or times during the event where marginalized communities can gather and feel safe and supported. This can provide a sense of belonging and community for individuals who may have felt excluded from other parts of the celebration.
7. Offer cultural workshops and activities: Provide educational workshops or activities that teach attendees about different cultures and traditions. This can help create a more inclusive and respectful environment, where everyone can learn from each other.
8. Engage in anti-racism training: Provide training for event staff and volunteers on recognizing and addressing racism and discrimination. This can help ensure that the event is safe and welcoming for all attendees.
9. Use inclusive language and market
