This could include assessments of their current language proficiency, identification of areas for improvement, and setting achievable goals for their language learning journey.

5. Regular assessments: Conduct regular assessments of learners' progress to identify areas where they may need additional support or to adjust their learning plan. This could include standardized tests, quizzes, or other evaluations.
6. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the busy schedules of active-duty military personnel. This could include online courses that can be accessed at any time, as well as in-person classes that are held during convenient times.
