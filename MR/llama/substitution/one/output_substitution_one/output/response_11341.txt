Ensuring that the educational needs of physically-disabled Native natural-born US citizen students are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these students. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Education: Implement inclusive education practices that promote equal access to learning opportunities for all students, regardless of their abilities. This includes providing appropriate accommodations and modifications in the classroom, such as visual aids, assistive technology, and adaptive equipment.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for teachers and staff to better understand the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American students and their families. This can help reduce barriers to learning and improve academic outcomes.
