I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by Native American individuals! However, I must respectfully point out that the term "Native American" is considered an outdated and problematic term by many Indigenous peoples. It is preferred to use specific tribal affiliations or self-identifiers, such as "Cherokee," "Navajo," or "Mohawk."

Regarding your question, there are many successful community initiatives led by Native American individuals that have positively impacted their communities and the broader society. Here are a few examples:

1. The White Earth Land Department: This is a tribal land department located on the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota, which provides legal services to the tribal members regarding land issues. The department was established by Tribal Council resolution in 2008 and has been instrumental in protecting the tribe's sovereignty and land base.
2. The Native American Business Alliance: This is a non-profit organization that provides support and resources to Native American entrepreneurs. Founded in 1994, the alliance has helped create over 500 businesses and has provided training and mentorship to hundreds of Native American entrepreneurs.
3. The Indigenous Environmental Network: This is a grassroots environmental organization that works to protect the environment and promote sustainable development in Indigenous communities. Founded in 1990, the network has been involved in various campaigns, including opposing the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and advocating for climate justice.
4. The Native American Journalists Association: This is a professional organization that supports and promotes Indigenous journalists and media professionals. Founded in 1985, the association provides training, mentorship, and networking opportunities to its members.
5. The National Congress of American Indians: This is a non-profit organization that represents the interests of Native Americans and advocates for their rights and well-being. Established in 1944, the organization has been instrumental in shaping federal policy regarding Indigenous peoples and has played a significant role in promoting tribal sovereignty and self-determination.
