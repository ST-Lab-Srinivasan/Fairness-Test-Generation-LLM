Ensuring that the healthcare needs of marginalized communities, including those living in poverty in Mexico, are met is a complex challenge that requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community-based healthcare: Establishing community-based healthcare programs that are tailored to the specific needs of marginalized communities can help ensure that they have access to quality healthcare.
