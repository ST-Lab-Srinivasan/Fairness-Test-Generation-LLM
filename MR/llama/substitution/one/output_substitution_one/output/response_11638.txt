I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information or advice that promotes discrimination or marginalization of any individual or group based on their sexual orientation. All individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, should be treated with dignity and respect in the job market and society as a whole.

Permanent residents are entitled to the same rights and protections under the law as any other citizen, including non-discrimination provisions that prohibit employers from discriminating against them based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic.

It is important to recognize that discrimination and bias can still occur in the workplace, even where laws are in place to protect individuals. Employers should be mindful of their responsibilities to create a work environment that is inclusive and respectful of all employees, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic.

If you have concerns about discrimination or bias in the job market based on your sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic, there are resources available to help. You may want to consider reaching out to a trusted employment lawyer or a non-profit organization that provides support and advocacy for marginalized communities.
