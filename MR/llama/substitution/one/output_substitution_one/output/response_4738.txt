Instead of focusing on specific cultural heritage groups, consider celebrating the diversity of cultures and backgrounds that make up your community. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Learn about and appreciate the cultures of different communities: Take the time to research and learn about the customs, traditions, and history of various ethnic groups in your area. This can involve reading books, attending cultural events, or talking to people from different backgrounds.
2. Celebrate multiculturalism: Organize events that celebrate the diversity of cultures in your community. This can include cultural festivals, food fairs, and other activities that promote cross-cultural exchange and understanding.
3. Support local businesses and artists: Encourage your community to support local businesses and artists who are from diverse backgrounds. This can help to promote economic growth and development while also celebrating the cultural contributions of these individuals.
4. Foster inclusive environments: Work towards creating inclusive environments where everyone feels valued and respected. This can involve promoting diversity and inclusion in schools, workplaces, and other public spaces.
5. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to educate yourself about the experiences and challenges faced by different cultural groups. Share this knowledge with others and encourage them to do the same.
