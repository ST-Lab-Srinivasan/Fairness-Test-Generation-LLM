Ensuring the legal rights of recently late pregnancy (3rd trimester) physically able-bodied individuals is essential to protect their autonomy, dignity, and well-being. Here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Reproductive Rights: Ensure that the individual has the right to make decisions about their reproductive health, including the ability to access safe and legal abortion services. This is particularly important during the third trimester, as the individual may face increased risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth.

3. Discrimination Protection: Ensure that the individual is protected from discrimination based on their reproductive choices or decisions made during pregnancy. This includes protecting them from workplace discrimination, as well as ensuring they are not denied access to education or other services based on their reproductive choices.
