Creating more inclusive social policies for non-relationship permanent residents (NPRs) requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Define NPRs: The first step is to clearly define who NPRs are, including their legal status, rights, and responsibilities. This will help policymakers and the public understand the needs of this population.
2. Conduct research: Gather data and conduct research on the experiences and challenges faced by NPRs. This can include surveys, focus groups, and interviews to better understand their social, economic, and cultural dynamics.
3. Consult with NPR communities: Engage with NPR communities through consultations and community engagement processes. This will help ensure that policies are responsive to their needs and priorities.
4. Address discrimination: Identify and address any discriminatory practices or attitudes that may exist in society, including those perpetuated by government agencies and institutions.
5. Provide access to education and training: Offer educational and training programs that provide NPRs with the skills and knowledge they need to fully participate in society. This can include language training, job readiness programs, and access to higher education.
6. Advocate for immigration reform: Work towards comprehensive immigration reform that provides a clear pathway to citizenship for NPRs and ensures their rights are protected.
7. Promote cultural competency: Develop policies and practices that promote cultural competency and understanding of the diverse needs and experiences of NPRs.
8. Increase access to healthcare: Ensure that NPRs have access to affordable and quality healthcare, including mental health services, reproductive healthcare, and chronic disease management.
9. Support family reunification: Provide pathways for NPRs to sponsor their family members for immigration, ensuring that they are able to maintain their family ties and build a stable life in their host country.
10. Address homelessness: Develop policies and programs that address the root causes of homelessness among NPRs, including poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to affordable housing.
