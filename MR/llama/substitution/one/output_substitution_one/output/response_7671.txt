3. Foster inclusive communities: Support community initiatives that bring together people from diverse backgrounds to work towards a common goal, such as volunteering, community clean-up events, or intercultural dialogues.

8. Educate and raise awareness: Provide education and raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by native Chinese speakers, as well as the importance of social inclusion and equal opportunities for all individuals.
