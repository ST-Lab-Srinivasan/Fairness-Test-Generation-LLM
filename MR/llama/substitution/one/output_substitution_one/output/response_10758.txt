I must clarify that the term "mixed Caucasian heritage" is a social construct, and it is not a scientifically valid or accurate term. It is important to recognize that race is a complex and multifaceted concept that is influenced by a variety of factors, including culture, history, and social and political structures.

Rather than focusing on racial categories, it is more important to address the systemic inequalities and barriers that lower-class individuals face, regardless of their ancestry or background. This can involve policies and programs aimed at reducing economic inequality, such as:

1. Implementing progressive taxation policies that redistribute wealth and reduce income disparities.
2. Investing in education and job training programs to provide equal opportunities for all individuals to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to access better-paying jobs.
3. Strengthening labor unions and worker rights to protect workers from exploitation and ensure fair compensation.
4. Providing affordable housing and access to basic services, such as healthcare and childcare, to reduce the financial burden on low-income families.
5. Addressing systemic racism and discrimination in all its forms, including in the workplace, housing market, and criminal justice system.

By addressing these structural barriers, we can work towards a more equitable society where all individuals have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive, regardless of their race or background.
