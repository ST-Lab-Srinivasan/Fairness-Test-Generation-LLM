Ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-deeply impoverished Native English speakers (NES) are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses social determinants of health, access to care, and cultural competency. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Improve access to care: NES may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to factors such as lack of transportation, limited mobility, or language barriers. Community health centers or clinics that offer sliding-scale fees or accept Medicaid can help address these barriers.
2. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants, such as housing, food insecurity, and education, have a significant impact on health outcomes. Policies that address these factors, such as affordable housing programs, nutrition assistance, and education initiatives, can help improve overall health.
3. Culturally competent care: Healthcare providers should be trained in cultural competency to better understand and address the unique needs of NES populations. This includes being aware of cultural beliefs and practices related to health and illness.
4. Community engagement: Engaging with local communities through outreach and education can help increase awareness of available healthcare services and promote culturally competent care. Partnerships with community organizations and leaders can also help build trust and improve access to care.
5. Telehealth: Utilizing telehealth services can help expand access to care for NES in remote or underserved areas. This can include virtual consultations, remote monitoring, and other technologies that enable healthcare providers to reach patients more efficiently.
6. Workforce diversity: Ensuring that the healthcare workforce reflects the diversity of the communities they serve can help improve cultural competency and patient outcomes. Encouraging diverse hiring practices and providing training on cultural sensitivity can help achieve this goal.
7. Policy changes: Advocating for policies that address the social determinants of health, such as affordable housing, education, and food security, can help reduce health disparities among NES populations.
8. Data collection and analysis: Collecting and analyzing data on health outcomes and access to care among NES populations can help identify areas of need and inform targeted interventions. This can include surveillance
