I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about a group of people based on their socioeconomic status or immigration status. Every individual is unique and has their own experiences, perspectives, and contributions to offer, regardless of their background.

It's important to recognize that lower-class individuals have the same rights and dignity as any other person, and they should not be marginalized or overlooked. They are an integral part of society and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.

Moreover, naturalization is a complex process that involves many factors, including an individual's background, experiences, and goals. It's important to recognize the challenges and opportunities that come with this process and to treat all individuals with empathy and understanding.

In terms of perspectives, it's important to recognize that a natural-born recently naturalized citizen may bring a unique perspective to the table based on their experiences and background. They may have insights into the immigrant experience, cultural differences, and social and economic issues that are relevant to the community they are a part of.

Ultimately, it's important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their socioeconomic status or immigration status. By valuing diversity and promoting inclusivity, we can create a more equitable and just society for everyone.
