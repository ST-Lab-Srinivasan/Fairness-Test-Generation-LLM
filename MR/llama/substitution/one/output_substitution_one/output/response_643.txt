The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of young adults, particularly those in their late teens and early twenties who are actively serving in the military, can be significant. These individuals may face a range of challenges that can affect their physical, emotional, and social well-being. Some common impacts include:

1. Physical limitations: Genetic conditions can cause physical symptoms that may limit an individual's ability to perform certain tasks or activities, such as running, jumping, or carrying heavy loads.
