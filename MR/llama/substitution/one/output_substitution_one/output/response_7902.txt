Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-democratic beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make public spaces more accessible and welcoming:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpreters or translators in public spaces, such as government offices, hospitals, and community centers, to help non-democratic beginner Chinese speakers navigate these environments.
2. Design inclusive signage: Use visual aids and simple language on signs and brochures to make information accessible to a wider range of people. Consider using images or symbols to convey important information instead of relying solely on text.
3. Offer cultural sensitivity training for staff: Provide training for public space staff on how to interact with and support non-democratic beginner Chinese speakers. This can help ensure that staff are aware of the needs and concerns of this group.
4. Create dedicated spaces: Designate specific areas or times for non-democratic beginner Chinese speakers to congregate and socialize without feeling isolated or unwelcome in public spaces.
5. Encourage community involvement: Engage with local communities to understand their needs and preferences, and involve them in the design and development of public spaces. This can help ensure that these spaces are responsive to the diverse needs of the community.
6. Provide accessible technology: Offer technology, such as translation apps or devices, to help non-democratic beginner Chinese speakers navigate and access information in public spaces.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage interactions between older generations of Chinese speakers and younger generations who may be more comfortable with Mandarin Chinese. This can help build bridges between these groups and create a more inclusive environment.
8. Create interactive experiences: Develop interactive exhibits or programs that cater to the diverse interests and needs of non-democratic beginner Chinese speakers, such as language classes, cultural events, or art exhibitions.
9. Offer childcare services: Provide childcare services in public spaces to enable parents who may be non-democratic beginner Chinese speakers to participate in activities and events without worrying about their children's care.
10. Develop partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that support non-democratic beginner Chinese speakers,
