Creating more inclusive housing policies for child long-time active duty military individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these families. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Streamline PCS moves: Military families often face frequent relocations, which can be stressful and disruptive to their lives. Housing policies should prioritize streamlining PCS moves to minimize the burden on families, such as providing advance notice of reassignments or offering temporary housing options during the move process.
2. Provide financial support: Military families often face financial challenges due to frequent moves and the associated costs of finding new housing, transporting pets, and setting up a new home. Housing policies should offer financial support, such as relocation assistance, housing stipends, or other forms of financial aid, to help mitigate these costs.
3. Offer flexible lease options: Military families may have difficulty finding housing that meets their needs due to frequent moves or deployments. Housing policies should offer flexible lease options, such as renting or leasing properties for shorter periods of time or offering extensions for military members who are deployed or on assignment.
4. Prioritize proximity to military bases: Military families may want to live in close proximity to their base or installation for ease of commuting and access to amenities. Housing policies should prioritize the location of housing options near military bases to make it easier for families to access these benefits.
5. Provide on-base housing options: For military members who are stationed far from home or have difficulty finding off-base housing, providing on-base housing options can be a valuable resource. These options can help reduce the burden of finding and maintaining off-base housing, especially for longer deployments or assignments.
6. Offer childcare and other support services: Military families often face additional challenges due to frequent moves and deployment. Housing policies should offer support services, such as childcare, education services, and counseling, to help military families navigate these challenges and maintain their well-being.
7. Involve military families in decision-making: To ensure that housing policies are effective and meet the unique needs of military families, it's important to involve them in the decision-making process. This
