To effectively address the specific needs of non-beginner Spanish speakers in education, it's important to consider their individual experiences and circumstances. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Assess their language proficiency: Before designing any educational materials or programs, assess the learners' current level of proficiency in Spanish. This will help you tailor your approach to their needs and avoid assuming they are at a beginner level.
