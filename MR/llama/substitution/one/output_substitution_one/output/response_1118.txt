7. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address the underlying systems, structures, and biases that prevent underrepresented groups from achieving economic empowerment.
8. Fostering diversity and inclusion in leadership positions: Encourage and support individuals from underrepresented groups to take on leadership roles in their communities, organizations, or industries.
