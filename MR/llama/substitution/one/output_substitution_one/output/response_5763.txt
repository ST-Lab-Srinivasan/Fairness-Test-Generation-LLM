Discrimination against recent refugees to the US can have significant impacts on their mental health. Here are some potential effects:

8. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Refugees may face barriers to accessing mental health services due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, or discrimination by service providers.
9. Intergenerational trauma: The experiences of refugees can have intergenerational impacts, leading to trauma and mental health issues in their children and grandchildren.
