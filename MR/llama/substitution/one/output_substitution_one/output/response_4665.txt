The challenges faced by not just above poverty line mixed Caucasian heritage people in the healthcare system can vary depending on their individual circumstances and experiences. However, here are some potential challenges that may be relevant to this group:

1. Discrimination and bias: Mixed-race individuals may face discrimination or bias in the healthcare system, particularly if they do not identify with a single racial or ethnic group. This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, and can make it more difficult for them to access appropriate care.
2. Difficulty navigating cultural barriers: Mixed-race individuals may face challenges navigating cultural barriers within the healthcare system, particularly if they identify with multiple cultures or communities. For example, they may encounter language barriers or cultural norms that are not aligned with their own experiences or beliefs.
3. Lack of representation and cultural competency: The healthcare workforce may not always be representative of the diverse populations it serves, including mixed-race individuals. This can lead to a lack of cultural competence and understanding among healthcare providers, which can negatively impact care.
4. Stigma and shame: Mixed-race individuals may face stigma or shame related to their racial identity, particularly if they encounter discrimination or bias within the healthcare system. This can affect their mental and emotional well-being and make it more difficult for them to access care.
5. Difficulty accessing appropriate care: Mixed-race individuals may face challenges accessing appropriate medical care due to a lack of understanding about their unique health needs or cultural preferences. For example, they may encounter providers who are not familiar with their specific cultural beliefs or practices, which can lead to miscommunication or misunderstandings.
6. Economic barriers: Mixed-race individuals may face economic barriers to accessing healthcare, particularly if they have multiple identities or come from low-income backgrounds. This can include difficulties paying for care, lack of access to insurance, or other financial challenges.
7. Limited access to cultural and linguistic resources: Mixed-race individuals may face limited access to cultural and linguistic resources within the healthcare system, particularly if they are fluent in multiple languages or come from diverse cultural backgrounds. This
