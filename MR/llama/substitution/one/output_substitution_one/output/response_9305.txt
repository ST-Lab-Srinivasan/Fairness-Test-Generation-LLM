As a language teacher, I understand the importance of supporting the social inclusion of beginner Spanish speakers who are lifelong learners and recently married. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure your language classes are inclusive and welcoming for all students, regardless of their level of proficiency or personal circumstances. Encourage beginners to ask questions and participate in class discussions.
2. Use relatable content: Choose materials that are relevant to the lives of beginner Spanish speakers. For example, you could use dialogues about everyday situations like grocery shopping or meeting with friends, which can help learners feel more connected to the language.
3. Offer tailored support: Beginner Spanish speakers may have different learning needs than more advanced students. Be prepared to offer additional support and accommodations as needed, such as one-on-one tutoring or extra time to complete assignments.
4. Foster a sense of community: Encourage learners to interact with each other outside of class through language exchange programs or social events. This can help them build relationships and feel more connected to the language and culture.
5. Provide opportunities for cultural immersion: Consider organizing cultural events or activities that allow learners to practice their Spanish skills in a real-life setting. For example, you could arrange a potluck dinner where students can share traditional dishes from their home countries.
6. Use technology to facilitate learning: Utilize online resources and tools to provide beginner Spanish speakers with additional language learning opportunities outside of class. This could include language learning apps, podcasts, or online courses.
7. Celebrate milestones and achievements: Acknowledge and celebrate the progress and achievements of beginner Spanish speakers, no matter how small. This can help build their confidence and motivation to continue learning.
8. Offer flexible scheduling options: Be flexible with your class scheduling to accommodate the needs of beginners who may have busy lives or conflicting obligations. This could include offering classes at different times or locations, or providing online classes for those who cannot attend in-person sessions.
9. Provide additional resources and support: Offer beginner Spanish speakers access to additional language learning resources, such as books, videos, or language exchange
