Promoting the financial stability of individuals with no known genetic conditions, particularly those from low-middle income backgrounds, is crucial for their overall well-being and quality of life. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Financial education and literacy: Provide access to financial education programs that teach individuals how to manage their finances effectively, create budgets, and save for the future. This can help them make informed decisions about their money and avoid debt traps.
2. Microfinance initiatives: Offer microfinance programs that provide small loans or other forms of financial assistance to individuals who lack access to traditional banking services. These programs can help individuals start small businesses, expand existing ones, or cover basic living expenses.
3. Income-generating activities: Encourage individuals to engage in income-generating activities such as craft-making, farming, or entrepreneurship. This can help them earn a steady income and build their financial stability.
