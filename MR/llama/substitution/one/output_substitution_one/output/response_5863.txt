Introduction:
Marriage and gender identity are two complex social constructs that can significantly impact an individual's life. In the context of Arabic language learners, their marital status can affect their learning experience and identity formation. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker actively partially identifying as male identifying individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative effects on language learning. On the one hand, married individuals may have more opportunities for language practice and exposure due to their partner's support and encouragement. On the other hand, married individuals may face challenges such as time constraints, conflicting priorities, and societal expectations that can hinder their language learning progress (El-Rayess & Ghanem, 2017).

Gender identity is another important factor to consider in the context of Arabic language learners. Research has shown that individuals who identify as male or female may experience different levels of motivation and confidence in their language learning abilities (Meara & Meara, 2013). Additionally, societal expectations and cultural norms can influence an individual's gender identity and affect their language learning experience (Hamdi, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. A total of 30 beginner Arabic speaker actively partially identifying as male identifying individuals will be recruited for the study. Participants will complete a demographic questionnaire and participate in semi-structured interviews to gather qualitative data on their language learning experiences, marital status, and gender identity. Quantitative data will be collected through a language proficiency test and a learner autonomy scale.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on language learning and gender identity by investigating the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker actively partially identifying as male identifying individuals. The findings will provide valuable insights into how societal expectations and cultural norms affect an individual's language learning experience and gender identity.

Conclusion:
The proposed study will investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic
