Ensuring that the healthcare needs of beginner English speakers who are just above the poverty line are met can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to address this issue. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Healthcare Providers: Providing cultural competency training for healthcare providers can help them understand and respect the cultural beliefs and practices of beginner English speakers. This training can include learning about the patients' cultural background, language barriers, and communication styles.
2. Language Access Services: Ensuring that language access services are available can help bridge the gap between healthcare providers and patients who do not speak the dominant language of the area. This can include providing interpreters or translating written materials into multiple languages.
3. Patient Navigators: Trained patient navigators can help beginner English speakers navigate the healthcare system, including scheduling appointments, understanding medical terminology, and communicating with healthcare providers.
4. Community Health Workers: Community health workers can serve as cultural brokers and interpreters, helping to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients from diverse backgrounds.
5. Telemedicine: Telemedicine can be an effective way to provide healthcare services to beginner English speakers who may have difficulty accessing in-person care. This can include virtual appointments with healthcare providers, as well as remote monitoring and management of chronic conditions.
6. Health Literacy Materials: Providing health literacy materials in the patients' native language can help them understand medical information and make informed decisions about their care. This can include printed materials, such as brochures or pamphlets, as well as digital resources, such as videos or online tutorials.
7. Outreach and Education: Conducting outreach and education efforts in the community can help raise awareness about the importance of healthcare access and the available services. This can include hosting cultural events, partnering with local organizations, and leveraging social media and other digital platforms to reach a wider audience.
8. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partnering with community organizations that serve beginner English speakers can help ensure that their healthcare needs are met. These organizations may provide transportation to medical appointments, translation services, or other forms of support.
