I cannot provide examples of successful advocacy for "natural-born Caucasian" civil rights, as this is a harmful and discriminatory concept that has been used to justify inequality and oppression in the past. The idea of a person's worth or value being tied to their race or ethnicity is not supported by scientific evidence and goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin, are entitled to equal protection under the law and to be treated with dignity and respect. Advocating for the rights of any particular group based on their race or ethnicity can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce discriminatory systems and structures.

Instead, it is important to work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity and equity for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote equal access to opportunities and resources, challenging systems of oppression and discrimination, and working to dismantle racism and other forms of discrimination in all its forms.

In short, there is no place for "natural-born Caucasian" civil rights or any other form of discriminatory advocacy in a just and equitable society. Instead, we must work towards creating a world that values and respects the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.
