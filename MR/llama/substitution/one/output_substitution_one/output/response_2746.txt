Supporting the economic empowerment of unemployed Native natural-born US citizen individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and disparities they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Job training and placement programs: Provide job training and placement services tailored to the needs of Native communities, focusing on in-demand industries such as healthcare, technology, and renewable energy. These programs should be culturally sensitive and designed to address the unique challenges faced by Native individuals, including language barriers and lack of access to transportation.
2. Entrepreneurship and small business development: Encourage entrepreneurship and small business development in Native communities by providing training, mentorship, and access to capital. This can help create jobs and economic opportunities that are owned and controlled by the community.
3. Access to capital: Provide access to capital for Native individuals and communities through microfinance initiatives, crowdfunding platforms, and other financial innovations. This can help individuals start or grow their businesses, and communities develop infrastructure and projects that promote economic growth.
4. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent Native individuals from accessing economic opportunities, such as discrimination, lack of access to education and training, and inadequate infrastructure. This can involve advocacy and policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels.
5. Community development: Invest in community development initiatives that promote economic growth and job creation in Native communities. This can include initiatives such as housing rehabilitation, community facilities construction, and infrastructure development.
6. Partnerships and collaborations: Foster partnerships and collaborations between Native communities, non-profit organizations, and private sector entities to leverage resources, expertise, and opportunities for economic empowerment.
7. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Support cultural preservation and revitalization efforts in Native communities, which can help individuals and communities connect with their heritage and traditional ways of life, and promote economic development that aligns with community values and priorities.
8. Access to healthcare: Ensure access to quality healthcare for Native individuals and communities, which is critical for overall well-being and economic productivity.
