5. Create job opportunities: Work with employers to create job opportunities specifically for beginner English speakers. This can include temporary or part-time work, internships, or apprenticeships.
6. Provide housing support: Offer financial assistance or resources to help beginner English speakers find affordable housing. This can include down payment assistance, mortgage insurance, or rental subsidies.
7. Encourage savings habits: Promote the importance of saving and encourage beginner English speakers to set aside a portion of their income each month. This can be done through financial education programs or by providing access to high-yield savings accounts.
