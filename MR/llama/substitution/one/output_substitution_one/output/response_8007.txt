Having diverse perspectives from civilian non-democrat people in leadership roles can bring numerous benefits to an organization or government. Here are some of the key advantages:

1. Fresh ideas and innovation: Non-democratic civilians can offer unique viewpoints and ideas that may not have been considered by democratically elected leaders. Their outside perspective can lead to innovative solutions and approaches that can help drive growth and progress.
2. Access to a broader talent pool: By appointing non-democratic civilians to leadership roles, organizations can tap into a wider pool of skilled and experienced individuals who may not have been eligible for democratic office. This can lead to more diverse and effective leadership teams.
3. Expertise in specific areas: Non-democratic civilians often have specialized knowledge and expertise in areas such as technology, finance, or international relations. Their input can help inform policy decisions and strategic planning.
4. Enhanced accountability: By involving non-democratic civilians in leadership roles, organizations can increase their accountability to the public. This is because non-democratic civilians are not beholden to special interest groups or political parties, allowing them to make decisions based solely on what they believe is best for the organization and society as a whole.
5. Reduced potential for corruption: Non-democratic civilians may be less susceptible to corrupt practices such as nepotism or cronyism, as they are not beholden to personal relationships or political favors.
6. Increased representation of marginalized groups: By appointing non-democratic civilians to leadership roles, organizations can ensure that the voices and interests of marginalized groups are better represented in decision-making processes.
7. Improved decision-making: Non-democratic civilians can provide a checks-and-balances system on democratically elected leaders, helping to ensure that decisions are well-informed and based on a broad range of perspectives.
8. Enhanced credibility: Appointing non-democratic civilians to leadership roles can lend greater legitimacy to an organization or government, as it demonstrates a commitment to diversity and inclusivity.
