Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native English speakers involves understanding their needs and preferences, and designing spaces that cater to them. Here are some strategies for creating more inclusive public spaces:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people of all abilities by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable individuals with disabilities to fully participate in public life.
2. Signage: Provide clear and visible signage in multiple languages to help non-native English speakers navigate the space. This can include maps, directions, and information about amenities and services.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Consider the cultural backgrounds of the moderate native English speakers when designing the public space. For example, provide seating areas or quiet rooms for individuals who may need a break from the hustle and bustle of the space.
4. Language support: Offer language support services such as interpreters or translated materials to help non-native English speakers access information and services.
5. Community outreach: Engage with local communities to understand their needs and preferences when designing the public space. This can involve conducting surveys, holding community meetings, or partnering with local organizations.
6. Inclusive programming: Offer a range of programs and activities that cater to the diverse needs and interests of moderate native English speakers. This can include cultural events, language classes, and recreational activities.
7. Flexible spaces: Design public spaces that are flexible and adaptable to different uses and user groups. For example, provide multi-use spaces that can be converted into different configurations depending on the needs of the users.
8. Technology integration: Incorporate technology such as digital displays, interactive kiosks, or mobile apps to provide information and services in a variety of formats and languages.
9. Access to nature: Provide access to green spaces or natural areas within the public space to promote well-being and relaxation for all users.
10. Collaborative design: Involve diverse stakeholders in the design process, including moderate native English speakers, to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account. This can involve holding co-design workshops or engaging in ongoing consultation with community
