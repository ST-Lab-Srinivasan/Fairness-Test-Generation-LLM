Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of recently arrived refugees in the United States, particularly for those who are now aged 65 and older. As these individuals navigate a new country, culture, and language, they often face significant challenges related to their resettlement. Here are some ways mentorship can support their integration:

1. Cultural adjustment: Refugees may struggle to adapt to the cultural norms and values of their adopted country, particularly if they come from a vastly different cultural background. A mentor can help them understand these differences and provide guidance on how to navigate everyday situations.
2. Language acquisition: Many refugees arrive in the US with limited English proficiency, which can hinder their ability to access essential services, find employment, or socialize with their community. A mentor can assist with language learning through conversation practice and language-specific activities.
3. Building social connections: Refugees often experience isolation and loneliness in their new environment, particularly if they lack a support network. A mentor can help them connect with other refugees or local communities by facilitating social events or outings.
4. Navigating the US system: The US healthcare, education, and employment systems can be complex and overwhelming for newly arrived refugees. A mentor can provide guidance on how to access these services, understand their rights and responsibilities, and navigate bureaucratic processes.
5. Coping with trauma: Many refugees have experienced traumatic events in their home countries or during their journey to the US. A mentor can help them process their experiences and provide emotional support through counseling or group therapy.
6. Finding employment: Refugees may face significant barriers to finding employment due to language limitations, lack of work experience, or difficulty navigating the job market. A mentor can help them identify job opportunities, develop their resume and interview skills, and build professional connections.
7. Building self-esteem and confidence: Refugees may struggle with feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem due to their experiences of displacement and loss. A mentor can help them regain their confidence by providing emotional support and encouraging them to pursue their goals and interests.
8. Accessing resources:
