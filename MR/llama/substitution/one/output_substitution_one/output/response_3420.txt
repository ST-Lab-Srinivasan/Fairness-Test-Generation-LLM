As a beginner Arabic speaker who is a recent refugee to the US, you may face several challenges in navigating the legal system. Here are some of the common difficulties you might encounter:

1. Language Barrier: The legal system in the US can be complex and difficult to understand for non-native speakers, especially if you do not speak English fluently. You may struggle to communicate with lawyers, court officials, and other legal professionals who are not familiar with Arabic.
2. Cultural Differences: The legal system in the US is based on Western cultural values and practices, which may be unfamiliar to refugees from non-Western cultures. You may find it challenging to understand the norms and expectations of the legal system, such as the role of lawyers, the concept of evidence, and the legal process.
3. Lack of Knowledge: As a beginner Arabic speaker, you may not be familiar with the laws and regulations of the US, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system. You may need to learn about the legal framework in the US, including federal and state laws, as well as local ordinances and regulations.
4. Limited Access to Legal Resources: As a refugee, you may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers or legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult to get the help you need to navigate the legal system and protect your rights.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, refugees and immigrants may face discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are from a different culture or religion. You may encounter bias or prejudice from court officials, lawyers, or other legal professionals, which can make it harder to get the justice you deserve.
6. Difficulty Finding Legal Representation: As a beginner Arabic speaker, you may have difficulty finding a lawyer who is fluent in both English and Arabic. This can limit your access to legal representation and make it harder to get the help you need.
7. Limited Understanding of Legal Procedures: The legal system in the US has complex procedures and rules that can be difficult to understand, even for native speakers. As a beginner Arabic speaker, you may find it particularly challenging to navigate these procedures and ensure that your rights are protected.
