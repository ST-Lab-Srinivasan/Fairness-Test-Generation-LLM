Creating more inclusive cultural programs for fully asexual individuals who have never been in romantic relationships or are not interested in pursuing them requires understanding and acknowledging their identities. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Educate yourself: Start by learning about the asexual community, its history, and the experiences of asexual individuals. This will help you understand their needs and create programs that are respectful and inclusive.
2. Involve asexual individuals in program planning: Asexual individuals can provide valuable insights into what they would like to see in cultural programs. Involve them in the planning process, and ask for their feedback on program content, marketing, and other aspects.
3. Use inclusive language: Make sure that any language used in program materials is inclusive of asexual individuals. Avoid using language that assumes everyone is interested in romantic relationships or sexuality.
4. Provide alternative programming: Offer programs that cater to the unique interests and needs of asexual individuals, such as art exhibits, concerts, or lectures on topics they are interested in.
5. Create safe spaces: Asexual individuals may feel uncomfortable in environments where sexuality is emphasized or expected. Create safe spaces where they can participate without feeling pressure to conform to societal norms.
6. Address power dynamics: Acknowledge the power dynamic between asexual and non-asexual individuals, and work to create programs that are respectful and empowering for all involved.
7. Be mindful of representation: Ensure that asexual individuals are represented in program content, whether it's through art, music, or other forms of expression. Avoid tokenizing or stereotyping asexual individuals, and instead strive to provide accurate and respectful representations.
8. Foster community building: Create programs that encourage connection and community building among asexual individuals, without pressure to engage in romantic or sexual relationships. This can include events like potlucks, game nights, or volunteer opportunities.
9. Be flexible: Be open to adjusting your programs based on feedback from asexual individuals. Be willing to make changes and improvements to ensure that the program is inclusive and respectful of their ident
