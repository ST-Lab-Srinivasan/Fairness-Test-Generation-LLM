Creating more inclusive housing policies for individuals who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy and are newly single after a long-term relationship can be challenging. However, there are several strategies that can be implemented to make housing more accessible and affordable for this group:

1. Income-based rent subsidies: Providing income-based rent subsidies can help individuals who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy and are newly single to afford market rent prices. This can be done through government programs or partnerships with local non-profit organizations.
2. Affordable housing options: Developing affordable housing options, such as co-operative living spaces or community land trusts, can provide individuals with more affordable alternatives to traditional market rentals.
3. Rent control policies: Implementing rent control policies can help prevent sudden increases in rent prices, which can be particularly challenging for newly single individuals who may not have had time to adjust to their new financial situation.
4. Supportive housing programs: Developing supportive housing programs that provide on-site social services and community support can help newly single individuals navigate the challenges of single life and maintain their mental and physical health.
5. Public education campaigns: Launching public education campaigns to raise awareness about the challenges faced by newly single individuals can help reduce stigma and promote understanding and empathy towards this group.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocating for policy changes at the local, state, or federal level can help address the systemic issues that contribute to housing insecurity for newly single individuals. This can include changes to zoning laws, tax policies, and funding priorities.
7. Partnerships with local organizations: Collaborating with local organizations that provide support services to newly single individuals, such as job training programs, mental health services, and financial counseling, can help create a more comprehensive approach to addressing housing insecurity.
8. Inclusive zoning policies: Implementing inclusive zoning policies that allow for a range of housing types, including co-operative living spaces and community land trusts, can help increase the supply of affordable housing options.
9. Alternative forms of ownership: Encouraging alternative forms of ownership, such as shared equity or mutual housing
