Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers with mixed Caucasian heritage can be achieved by incorporating elements that cater to their unique experiences and backgrounds. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural program includes a variety of viewpoints and experiences, including those of individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. This can be done by incorporating stories, music, and art from different cultures and traditions.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is offensive or insensitive to any particular group. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and included. Encourage participation from all individuals, regardless of their cultural background.
4. Provide opportunities for cultural exchange: Organize events or activities that allow participants to share their cultural practices and traditions with one another. This can help build bridges between different cultures and foster a sense of mutual respect.
5. Address stereotypes and biases: Be aware of any unconscious biases or stereotypes that may be present in the program, and address them directly. Encourage participants to challenge their own assumptions and biases, and promote a more nuanced understanding of different cultures.
6. Incorporate technology: Utilize digital tools and platforms to reach a wider audience and make cultural programs more accessible. For example, create online courses or virtual events that can be participated in from anywhere in the world.
7. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local community organizations that cater to diverse populations to help promote cultural understanding and exchange. This can help amplify the reach of the program and attract a more diverse audience.
8. Provide resources for language learning: Offer resources such as language classes, dictionaries, or other study materials to help participants improve their Chinese language skills. This can be especially helpful for those with limited exposure to the language.
9. Create intercultural dialogue: Organize events that facilitate intercultural dialogue and exchange between participants from different cultural backgrounds. This can help foster mutual understanding and respect, and promote a more inclusive cultural environment.
