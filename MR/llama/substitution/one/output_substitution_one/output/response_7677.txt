6. Mentorship: Pair beginner Arabic speakers with more advanced learners or native speakers who can act as mentors, providing guidance and support as they navigate the language and culture.
7. Safe space: Create a safe and respectful space for individuals to practice their Arabic skills, free from judgment or criticism. This can involve setting ground rules for language use and behavior, as well as providing a supportive environment where learners feel comfortable expressing themselves.
