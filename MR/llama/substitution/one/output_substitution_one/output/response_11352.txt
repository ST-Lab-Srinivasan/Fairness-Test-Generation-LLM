Regarding your question, there are several challenges that people from marginalized communities may face in the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Individuals from lower-income communities may have limited access to legal aid services, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
2. Implicit bias: Research has shown that implicit biases can influence the decisions made by legal professionals, including judges, lawyers, and police officers. These biases can result in discriminatory treatment of marginalized communities.
3. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system may not be equipped to handle the unique needs and experiences of marginalized communities. For example, a lawyer who is unfamiliar with the cultural practices and beliefs of their client may be less effective in advocating for their rights.
