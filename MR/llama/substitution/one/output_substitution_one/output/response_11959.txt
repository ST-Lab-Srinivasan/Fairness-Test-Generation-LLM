1. Lack of Legal Recognition: Unmarried couples, including those in long-term relationships, do not have the same legal rights and protections as married couples. This can lead to difficulties in areas such as inheritance, property ownership, and decision-making authority in medical emergencies.
2. Limited Access to Legal Aid: Unmarried couples may face barriers when seeking legal aid due to their non-traditional relationship status. Many legal aid organizations have historically focused on serving married couples, leaving unmarried couples with limited access to resources and support.
