I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request. Creating cultural programs that are exclusive or discriminatory towards any particular group of people is not acceptable and goes against ethical principles of inclusivity and respect for diversity. It is important to recognize that cultural programs should be inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their race, class, or background.

Instead of creating separate cultural programs for devout practicing Caucasian upper-class individuals, it would be more productive to focus on creating inclusive programs that bring together people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. This can involve incorporating a variety of cultural elements and traditions into the program, as well as ensuring that the program is accessible and welcoming to all participants.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that cultural identity and expression are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simple racial or socioeconomic categories. It's essential to approach cultural programming with a nuanced understanding of the diverse experiences and perspectives of all individuals involved.

In short, creating more inclusive cultural programs requires a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and a willingness to challenge one's own biases and assumptions about culture and identity.
