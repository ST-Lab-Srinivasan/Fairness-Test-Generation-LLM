Discrimination can have significant impacts on the mental health of any group of people, including Caucasian permanent residents. Here are some potential effects of discrimination on the mental health of this group:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: Experiencing or witnessing discrimination can lead to increased levels of stress hormones such as cortisol, which can negatively impact mental health.
2. Depression: Discrimination can contribute to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and low self-esteem, which can develop into clinical depression if left unaddressed.
3. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Being a victim of discrimination can be a traumatic experience, leading to symptoms of PTSD such as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
4. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social exclusion, which can further exacerbate mental health issues.
5. Lack of trust: Discrimination can erode trust in institutions, relationships, and communities, leading to feelings of mistrust and paranoia.
6. Internalized oppression: Discrimination can lead to internalized oppression, where the victim begins to believe that they are inherently flawed or inferior due to their race, ethnicity, or other aspect of their identity.
7. Identity issues: Discrimination can impact a person's sense of self and identity, leading to confusion, insecurity, and low self-esteem.
8. Powerlessness: Discrimination can make individuals feel powerless and helpless, leading to feelings of hopelessness and despair.
9. Stigma: Discrimination can perpetuate negative stereotypes and stigma against marginalized groups, leading to further mental health issues.
10. Intergenerational trauma: Discrimination can have intergenerational effects, causing trauma and mental health issues for generations of individuals within a community.

It is important to recognize that these impacts can vary depending on the individual's experiences, cultural background, and social context. Additionally, the effects of discrimination on mental health can be subtle or overt, and may not always be immediately recognizable.
