I cannot provide information or advice on how to stereotype or discriminate against any particular group of people, including non-lower-class Mexican individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their socioeconomic status or background. Discriminating or making generalizations based on race, ethnicity, or social class is not only morally reprehensible, but it also goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

Instead of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination, it's important to use data to highlight the issues faced by marginalized communities in a respectful and inclusive manner. This can involve collecting and analyzing data on the social, economic, and political factors that affect these communities, such as poverty rates, access to education and healthcare, and discrimination based on race or ethnicity.

By using data in this way, you can help bring attention to the systemic issues that affect marginalized communities and advocate for policies and practices that promote greater equality and inclusion. For example, you could use data to:

1. Highlight the disproportionate impact of poverty on marginalized communities, such as African Americans or Hispanics.
2. Show the disparities in access to quality education for different racial and ethnic groups.
3. Illustrate the unequal distribution of wealth and resources within a society.
4. Document instances of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or social class.
5. Examine the effects of systemic inequality on mental and physical health outcomes for marginalized communities.

By using data in a responsible and respectful manner, you can help promote greater understanding and empathy for marginalized communities and advocate for policies that address the root causes of inequality.
