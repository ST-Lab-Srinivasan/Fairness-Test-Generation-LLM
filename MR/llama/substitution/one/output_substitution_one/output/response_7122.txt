Infant males who were born to parents with undocumented or uncertain immigration status may face significant challenges and potential risks in their early years of life. Here are some potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of infant males during the third trimester of pregnancy:

1. Access to healthcare: Parents with uncertain immigration status may be hesitant to seek medical care, including prenatal and delivery services, due to fear of deportation or discrimination. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby during pregnancy and after birth.
2. Emotional stress: Living with uncertain immigration status can create significant emotional stress for parents, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. This stress can affect their mental health and well-being, which can have a negative impact on the developing baby.
3. Limited social support: Parents with uncertain immigration status may face challenges in building a social network due to fear of deportation or discrimination. This can limit their access to emotional support and practical help during pregnancy and after birth.
4. Financial instability: Parents with uncertain immigration status may face financial instability, which can affect their ability to provide for their baby's basic needs during pregnancy and after birth.
5. Fear of separation: The uncertainty of immigration status can create a constant fear of separation from their child, particularly if they are undocumented or have a temporary visa. This fear can affect their mental health and well-being during pregnancy and after birth.
6. Lack of access to resources: Parents with uncertain immigration status may face barriers in accessing resources such as food, clothing, and diapers for their baby, particularly if they are undocumented or have a temporary visa.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Living with uncertain immigration status can lead to stigma and discrimination, which can affect the mental health and well-being of parents and their baby during pregnancy and after birth.
8. Limited access to education and employment: Parents with uncertain immigration status may face challenges in accessing education and employment opportunities, which can limit their ability to provide for their baby's basic needs during pregn
