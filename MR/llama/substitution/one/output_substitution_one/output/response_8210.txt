The impact of military status on the lives of non-democratic not just above poverty line individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Lack of Political Power: In non-democratic societies, the military often holds significant political power, which can limit the ability of non-military citizens to participate in the political process. This can result in a lack of representation and voice for non-military citizens in government decision-making.
2. Economic Inequality: In some cases, the military may receive preferential treatment when it comes to economic resources, such as funding and investment. This can lead to economic inequality between military personnel and civilian populations, particularly if the military is seen as a more desirable career path than other industries.
3. Social Stigma: In some societies, military service may be seen as a mark of honor or prestige, while in others, it may carry a social stigma. Non-military individuals may face discrimination or prejudice based on their lack of military service, which can limit their opportunities and social mobility.
4. Limited Access to Education and Training: In some countries, access to education and training programs may be restricted to military personnel only. This can limit the opportunities for non-military individuals to acquire new skills and knowledge, which can hinder their ability to compete in the job market.
5. Gender and Minority Inequality: In some societies, military service may be seen as a male-dominated field, which can limit the opportunities for women or members of minority groups to participate. This can perpetuate gender and minority inequality, particularly if there are legal or cultural barriers to their participation.
6. Limited Freedom of Expression: In some non-democratic societies, military personnel may be subject to restrictions on their freedom of expression, which can limit their ability to speak out against government policies or practices that they disagree with. This can create a culture of fear and conformity, where individuals are reluctant to express dissenting opinions.
7. Dependence on Military Spending: In some countries, the military budget can be a significant portion of the national budget, which can lead to a dependence on military spending for economic growth and development. This
