I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that there is a fixed and distinct group of "permanent resident mixed Caucasian heritage people." The concept of race is a social construct, and it does not reflect any inherent or biological differences between people. Additionally, the term "mixed race" can be problematic as it reinforces the idea that race is something that can be reduced to a single category or label.

Instead, I suggest using terms like "multiracial," "mixed-race," or "of diverse descent" to describe individuals who have multiple ethnic backgrounds. This language is more inclusive and respectful of the diversity of experiences and identities within racial and ethnic groups.

Regarding your question, there are many ways to support civic engagement among people of any racial or ethnic background. Here are some suggestions:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize events or campaigns to register eligible voters, particularly in communities where voting rights have been historically suppressed or marginalized.
2. Civic education: Provide opportunities for people to learn about their rights and responsibilities as citizens, including how to vote, run for office, or participate in advocacy efforts.
3. Community organizing: Support local initiatives that bring people together to address social, economic, or political issues affecting their communities. This can involve advocacy, activism, or community-based projects.
4. Leadership development: Identify and support emerging leaders from underrepresented groups, providing them with training, mentorship, or networking opportunities to help them advance in their careers or pursue civic engagement efforts.
5. Advocacy campaigns: Collaborate with organizations that advocate for policies and practices that promote equity, inclusion, and social justice. This can involve lobbying elected officials, participating in public protests or rallies, or using social media to raise awareness about important issues.
6. Community events: Organize cultural festivals, town hall meetings, or other community gatherings that celebrate diversity and promote civic engagement among people of all backgrounds.
7. Nonpartisan voter guides: Create nonpartisan resources that provide information on candidates, ballot measures,
