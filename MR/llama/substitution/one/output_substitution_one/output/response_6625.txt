Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and growth of individuals, regardless of age. However, for older adults over the age of 85, mentorship can be particularly important as they may face physical, cognitive, or social challenges that can impact their daily lives. Here are some ways mentorship can benefit advanced older adults (over 85) who are ultra-conservative:

1. Preserving cultural and religious values: Many ultra-conservative individuals place great importance on their cultural and religious beliefs and practices. A mentor who shares these values can help guide them in preserving their traditions and practices, even as they age.
2. Building social connections: Advanced older adults may experience social isolation or feel disconnected from their communities due to physical limitations or mobility issues. A mentor can provide emotional support and help facilitate social interactions, such as volunteering or joining clubs or organizations that align with their interests.
3. Encouraging lifelong learning: Older adults are never too old to learn new things! A mentor can encourage advanced older adults to pursue new hobbies, interests, or educational opportunities, such as taking courses or attending workshops. This can help keep their minds active and engaged.
4. Providing practical support: As advanced older adults may face physical challenges, a mentor can offer practical support with daily tasks, such as grocery shopping, meal preparation, or light housekeeping. This can help them maintain their independence and quality of life.
5. Fostering emotional support: Older adults often experience emotional challenges related to aging, such as anxiety, depression, or grief. A mentor can offer emotional support and a listening ear, helping advanced older adults cope with these challenges in a healthy and constructive way.
6. Encouraging independence: While it's important for advanced older adults to receive support when needed, a mentor can also encourage them to maintain their independence by offering guidance on how to manage daily tasks and responsibilities. This can help build confidence and self-esteem.
7. Facilitating intergenerational connections: A mentor can help advanced older adults connect with younger generations,
