Ensuring the voices of physically-disabled recent immigrants to Canada are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to include and empower these individuals. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create accessible spaces: Ensure that physical spaces where decision-making occurs are accessible to people with disabilities. This includes providing wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
2. Involve disabled immigrants in planning processes: Actively seek out the participation of physically-disabled recent immigrants in planning and decision-making processes related to policies and services that affect their lives. This can be done through community outreach, surveys, focus groups, or other inclusive methods.
3. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as interpreters, note-takers, or assistive technology to ensure that disabled immigrants can fully participate in decision-making processes.
4. Build trust and relationships: Develop trust and relationships with disabled immigrant communities by consistently engaging with them and listening to their concerns. This helps build a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Advocate for policies that promote accessibility and inclusion in decision-making processes, such as the Accessible Canada Act or the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
6. Train decision-makers: Provide training to decision-makers on disability issues, accessibility, and inclusive practices to ensure they are better equipped to make decisions that benefit disabled immigrant communities.
7. Celebrate diversity: Highlight the diverse experiences and perspectives of disabled immigrants in decision-making processes to promote understanding and appreciation of their contributions.
8. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of disabled individuals, avoiding terms that perpetuate stereotypes or stigmatize disabilities.
9. Foster collaborations: Encourage collaborations between disabled immigrant communities, service providers, and decision-makers to promote mutual understanding and cooperation.
10. Monitor progress: Regularly monitor progress towards inclusivity and accessibility goals, assessing the effectiveness of strategies and identifying areas for improvement.
