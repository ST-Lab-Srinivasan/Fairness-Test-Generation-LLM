Using data to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers can be a valuable tool for language educators, researchers, and policymakers. Here are some ways data can be used to shed light on the challenges faced by novice English speakers:

1. Language proficiency assessments: Conducting regular language proficiency assessments can help identify areas where beginner English speakers struggle. These assessments can be based on standardized tests like TOEFL or IELTS, or custom-designed exams that focus on specific skills like reading comprehension or speaking fluency.
2. Learner Corpus Analysis: Analyzing large datasets of written and spoken language used by beginner English speakers can reveal common errors, grammatical mistakes, and areas where they struggle with vocabulary acquisition. This can help identify patterns in language use that are unique to this group.
3. Survey Research: Conducting surveys among beginner English speakers can provide valuable insights into their experiences, challenges, and motivations. Questions can be designed to gather information on learners' backgrounds, learning environments, and goals. This data can help identify the most pressing issues faced by this group.
4. Social Media Analytics: Monitoring social media platforms used by beginner English speakers can provide insights into their language use habits, communication patterns, and areas where they struggle with language acquisition. Hashtags, keywords, and sentiment analysis can be used to analyze language usage and identify common challenges.
5. Language Learning App Data: Analyzing data from language learning apps used by beginner English speakers can provide information on their progress, usage patterns, and areas where they struggle. This data can help identify the most effective features of these apps and inform the development of new tools to support language acquisition.
6. Neuroimaging Studies: Using neuroimaging techniques like fMRI or EEG can provide insights into how beginner English speakers process language, identify areas of the brain involved in language acquisition, and understand how language learning affects brain function. This data can help researchers develop more effective language learning strategies.
7. Speech Analysis: Analyzing speech samples from beginner English speakers can reveal patterns of pronunciation, intonation, and rhythm that are unique to this group. This data can help
