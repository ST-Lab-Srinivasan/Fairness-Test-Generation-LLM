I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or perpetuate discrimination or harm towards any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, immigration status, or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize that every person has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discriminating or treating individuals unfairly based on their immigration status can have severe consequences, including mental and physical health problems, social isolation, and decreased access to essential services such as healthcare and education.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to support and uplift marginalized communities, including those who are not deep in poverty but face other forms of discrimination or exclusion. This can involve advocating for policies that promote inclusivity, equity, and social justice, such as affordable housing, education and job training programs, and mental health services. Additionally, supporting community-based organizations that serve marginalized populations can help to address the root causes of poverty and inequality.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or any other personal characteristic. Let's work towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society for all.
