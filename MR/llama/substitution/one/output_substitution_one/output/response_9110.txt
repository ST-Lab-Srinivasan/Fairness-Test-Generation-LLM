To highlight the issues faced by beginner English speaker native French speakers, you could use data to identify common challenges and trends in their language learning journey. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Analyze language proficiency levels: Use standardized tests or self-assessed proficiency scales to determine the overall level of English proficiency among beginner learners. This can help identify areas where they struggle, such as grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation.
2. Track progress over time: Monitor learners' progress over a set period, such as several months or a year. This can help identify improvements and areas where learners need more practice or support.
3. Compare language use in different contexts: Analyze how learners use English in different situations, such as in formal writing, informal conversations, or during presentations. This can help identify areas where they struggle with language use in specific contexts.
4. Examine learner attitudes and motivation: Use surveys or interviews to gather data on learners' attitudes towards English learning and their motivation levels. This can help identify factors that affect their language learning progress, such as lack of motivation or self-doubt.
5. Investigate cultural differences: Examine how cultural differences between France and the Anglophone world may impact learners' language learning experience. For example, you could analyze how cultural norms around communication styles or learning preferences may influence learners' progress.
6. Compare learner profiles: Create learner profiles based on demographic data (age, gender, education level, etc.) and language proficiency levels. Analyze these profiles to identify patterns or trends that could inform instructional design or teaching strategies.
7. Monitor learner engagement: Track learners' engagement with English learning materials, such as the number of hours spent practicing English or the frequency of use. This can help identify areas where learners may be struggling to stay motivated or engaged.
8. Analyze error patterns: Use error analysis to identify common mistakes made by beginner English speakers and track how these errors change over time. This can help inform instructional design and teaching strategies to address these issues.
9. Investigate the impact of instructional approaches: Compare the effectiveness of different
