2. Access to Education and Training: Offer training and education programs that cater to the needs of married individuals, particularly those in their 30s and 40s. This can include vocational training, language courses, and professional certifications that can help them upskill and reskill in a rapidly changing job market.
3. Childcare Support: Provide affordable and high-quality childcare options to support married couples who need to balance work and family responsibilities. This can include government-subsidized daycare centers, parental leave policies, and flexible working arrangements.
4. Healthcare Support: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and affordable for all married individuals, regardless of their income level. This can include subsidies for medical procedures, mental health support, and wellness programs that promote overall health and well-being.
5. Retirement Planning: Encourage married couples to plan for their retirement by offering tax incentives for retirement savings, employer-matched retirement accounts, and financial planning resources.
