I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI and cannot provide advice or support that promotes or facilitates discrimination or unequal treatment based on any protected characteristic, including disability. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, deserve equal opportunities and access to education and other resources.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to support the educational aspirations of individuals with physical disabilities in a way that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and equality. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide accommodations and modifications: Offer accommodations and modifications that enable students with physical disabilities to participate fully in education. This may include wheelchair ramps, Braille materials, sign language interpretation, or assistive technology.
2. Promote accessibility in the curriculum: Incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences into the curriculum to promote inclusivity and representation. This may involve creating lesson plans that reflect the lives and experiences of individuals with disabilities, or incorporating disability-related topics into existing courses.
3. Offer support services: Provide support services such as academic advising, tutoring, and mental health counseling to help students with physical disabilities navigate the educational system and succeed academically.
4. Create inclusive learning environments: Foster a culture of inclusion and respect in classrooms and schools by promoting diversity and addressing ableism. Encourage students to share their experiences and perspectives, and provide opportunities for dialogue and mutual understanding.
5. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity: Work with educators, administrators, and policymakers to develop and implement policies and practices that promote inclusivity and accessibility in education. This may involve advocating for the use of assistive technology, adaptive sports programs, or other initiatives that support the educational aspirations of individuals with physical disabilities.

By prioritizing inclusivity and accessibility, educators can help ensure that individuals with physical disabilities have equal opportunities to pursue their educational aspirations and reach their full potential.
