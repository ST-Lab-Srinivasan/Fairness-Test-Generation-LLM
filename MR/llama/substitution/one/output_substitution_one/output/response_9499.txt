Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American natural-born US citizen leftists. Many Native American leftists have experienced systemic oppression and marginalization throughout their lives, which has shaped their political beliefs and actions. Mentorship can provide them with guidance, support, and a sense of belonging within their community.

Here are some ways mentorship can impact the development of Native American leftists:

1. Cultural connection: Many Native American leftists may feel disconnected from their cultural heritage due to historical trauma, forced assimilation, or intergenerational trauma. Mentorship can help reconnect them with their culture and provide a sense of belonging within their community. This connection can strengthen their political beliefs and actions, as they are more likely to prioritize the needs and interests of their community.
2. Political education: Mentorship can provide Native American leftists with political education and knowledge about their rights and responsibilities as citizens. This education can help them understand the intersections of colonialism, capitalism, and systemic oppression, which are critical to developing a leftist political perspective.
3. Community building: Mentorship can facilitate the creation of community networks and alliances among Native American leftists. By connecting with other like-minded individuals, they can build a stronger collective voice and advocate for their rights more effectively.
4. Leadership development: Mentorship can help identify and develop future leaders within the Native American leftist movement. This leadership development can occur through hands-on training and guidance from experienced mentors, as well as opportunities to take on leadership roles within their communities or organizations.
5. Healing and resistance: Mentorship can provide a space for healing and resistance within the context of colonization and systemic oppression. By fostering a sense of community and connection, mentorship can help Native American leftists find strength and resilience in their struggles against oppressive systems.
6. Intergenerational knowledge transfer: Mentorship can facilitate the transfer of knowledge and experiences between generations within the Native American leftist movement. This intergenerational exchange can help build a more robust and sustainable movement, as well as preserve the cultural heritage and political traditions of Native American communities.
