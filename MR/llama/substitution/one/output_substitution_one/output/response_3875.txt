Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of Native American recent refugees to the US who lean towards the right politically. These individuals face unique challenges as they navigate their new environment, culture, and political landscape. Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Cultural understanding: As a Native American refugee, it's essential to have someone who understands your cultural background and can offer guidance on how to navigate the complexities of American society. A mentor who is familiar with Native American culture can provide valuable insights and support in adapting to a new environment.
2. Political education: Many recent refugees may not be aware of the political landscape in the US, which can lead to confusion and disorientation. A mentor who is knowledgeable about politics can help educate them on the different political ideologies, parties, and issues, allowing them to make informed decisions.
3. Networking opportunities: A mentor can introduce you to their professional and social networks, providing valuable connections that can help you advance in your career or personal life. This can be especially important for recent refugees who may not have established connections in the US yet.
