Non-upper-class refugees to the US face several challenges in accessing quality healthcare. Here are some of the main obstacles they encounter:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: Refugees often have difficulty obtaining health insurance, as many employers do not offer coverage to undocumented workers or those with temporary status. This can result in delayed or foregone care, exacerbating existing conditions and creating new health problems.
2. Language Barriers: Many refugees face language barriers when trying to navigate the complex US healthcare system. Limited English proficiency can make it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers, understand medical instructions, and access necessary resources.
3.
