Provide them with information about available resources and support services, such as counseling, job training, and social events.

Advocate for the rights of mentally able-bodied Hindu communities and encourage their participation in decision-making processes.

These networks can be organized around shared cultural values and practices, and can help build a sense of belonging and identity.
