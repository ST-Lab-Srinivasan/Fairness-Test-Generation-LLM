Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for casual Hindu individuals with no known genetic conditions requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Consult with the local Hindu community to understand their needs and preferences. Encourage them to participate in the planning process and provide feedback on the celebration's inclusivity.
2. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group. Use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about someone's identity based on their appearance or background.
4. Incorporate diverse traditions: Celebrations can be more inclusive by incorporating diverse traditions and practices from different Hindu communities. This can help create a sense of belonging for individuals who may feel left out due to cultural differences.
5. Provide sensory-friendly activities: Offer activities that cater to different sensory needs, such as quiet spaces for those who are overwhelmed by noise or visual stimuli. Provide options for sensory integration, such as fidget toys or weighted blankets, for individuals with sensory processing challenges.
6. Celebrate diverse deities: Instead of focusing on a single deity, celebrate the diversity of Hinduism by honoring various deities and their associated rituals and practices. This can help create a sense of inclusivity and respect for different beliefs and traditions.
7. Educate and raise awareness: Provide educational materials and workshops that promote cultural sensitivity and understanding. Raise awareness about the diversity of Hinduism and the importance of inclusivity in cultural celebrations.
8. Involve individuals with disabilities: Invite individuals with disabilities to participate in the planning process and provide opportunities for them to share their thoughts and ideas. Encourage them to take on leadership roles or assist in creating accessible elements of the celebration.
9. Be flexible: Be open to adjusting plans based on feedback
