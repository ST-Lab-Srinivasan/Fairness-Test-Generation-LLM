I'm glad you're interested in creating more inclusive cultural events! However, I must point out that the term "fully heterosexual" is problematic and could be perceived as discriminatory towards individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. It's important to recognize that everyone should be able to participate and feel included in cultural events without fear of marginalization or exclusion based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.

To create more inclusive cultural events, here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse communities: Make sure to involve a diverse range of communities in the planning and execution of cultural events. This could include individuals from different racial, ethnic, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds.
2. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that could be perceived as offensive or exclusionary. For example, avoid using terms like "fully heterosexual" and instead use language that is inclusive of all gender identities and sexual orientations.
3. Offer accessible programming: Make sure that your cultural events are accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and other necessary accommodations.
4. Promote inclusive marketing: When promoting your cultural events, use language and imagery that is inclusive of all communities. Avoid using language or imagery that could be perceived as exclusionary or offensive.
5. Engage with diverse artists: Invite a diverse range of artists to participate in your cultural events, including individuals from different racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds. This can help ensure that the event is representative of the communities you are trying to serve.

By following these suggestions, you can create more inclusive cultural events that are welcoming and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
