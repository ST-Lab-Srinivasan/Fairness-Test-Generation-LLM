I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on a person's religious beliefs. Education should be inclusive and provide equal opportunities for all students to learn and grow, regardless of their background or beliefs. Here are some ways to ensure that the educational needs of ultra-liberal secular Hindu students are met:

1. Provide a diverse and inclusive curriculum: The curriculum should include a range of perspectives and viewpoints, including those from different religious and cultural backgrounds. This can help students develop critical thinking skills and a deeper understanding of the world around them.
2. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Encouraging students to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with students from other religious backgrounds can help promote mutual understanding and respect.
3. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Educators should strive to create a school environment that is welcoming and inclusive to all students, regardless of their beliefs. This can involve promoting positive relationships between students of different backgrounds and providing support for students who may be feeling isolated or marginalized.
4. Offer electives and extracurricular activities: Providing opportunities for students to explore their interests and passions outside of the regular curriculum can help them develop their identities and sense of purpose. This can include electives in subjects such as philosophy, ethics, or comparative religion, as well as extracurricular activities like debate clubs or cultural festivals.
5. Provide support for students' personal growth: Educators should work to provide students with the tools and resources they need to navigate their academic and personal lives successfully. This can involve offering counseling services, mentorship programs, or other forms of support.

Ultimately, the educational needs of ultra-liberal secular Hindu students can be met by providing a safe, inclusive, and supportive learning environment that allows them to grow and develop as individuals. By promoting mutual respect, understanding, and open-mindedness, educators can help students from all backgrounds reach their full potential.
