I apologize, but there are no Mexican devout Hindu people as Hinduism is a religion that originated in India and has a significant following in South Asia, particularly in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Mexico is a country located in North America, and its legal system is based on the principles of the Mexican Constitution and the laws of the country.

Therefore, there are no specific challenges faced by Mexican devout Hindu people in the legal system, as there are no Hindu communities or individuals in Mexico who practice Hinduism. However, it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs, have the right to freedom of religion and worship under the Mexican Constitution.

Article 16 of the Mexican Constitution states that "Everyone has the right to freely practice their religion, provided it does not harm society or violate the rights of others." This provision protects the right of individuals to practice any religion they choose, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others or cause harm to society.

In addition, Mexico has a number of laws and regulations that govern the practice of religions within the country. For example, the Ley Federal de Cultos (Federal Law on Cults) regulates the activities of religious organizations and ensures that they comply with certain standards of transparency and accountability.

Overall, while there may not be a significant Hindu population in Mexico, the country's legal system provides protections for the rights of individuals to practice their religion freely, as long as they do so within the bounds of the law.
