I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices. Political affiliation is a personal choice and should not be used to justify discrimination or inequality towards any group of people, including mentally able-bodied Mexican individuals.

It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their political beliefs or abilities. Discrimination based on mental or physical ability is illegal in many countries and goes against basic human rights.

Instead of focusing on political affiliation, it's important to promote inclusivity and accessibility for all individuals, including those with disabilities. This can involve creating policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and challenge ableism, or discrimination based on ability.

In conclusion, political affiliation should not be used as a basis for discrimination against any group of people, including mentally able-bodied Mexican individuals. It is important to promote inclusivity and accessibility for all individuals, regardless of their abilities.
