As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "undocumented" is problematic and dehumanizing. It is important to use language that respects the dignity and humanity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. Therefore, I suggest using terms such as "newly arrived migrants" or "individuals seeking refugee status."

Regarding your question, creating more inclusive cultural events for recently arrived migrants is an excellent way to foster a sense of belonging and community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community in the planning process: Engage with local organizations that support migrant communities to ensure that the event is representative of their needs and preferences. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and promote a sense of ownership over the event.
2. Provide translation services: Offer interpretation services in multiple languages to ensure that all attendees can fully participate and enjoy the event. This can include sign language interpretation for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Showcase diverse talent: Feature performances, art exhibitions, or other cultural elements that reflect the diverse backgrounds of migrant communities. This can help create a sense of pride and belonging among attendees.
4. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for event organizers and volunteers on cultural sensitivity and inclusivity to ensure that all attendees feel welcome and respected.
5. Create a safe space: Designate a safe space at the event where attendees can seek refuge if they need it, such as a quiet area or a space with comfortable seating. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and supported.
6. Encourage dialogue and connection: Facilitate opportunities for attendees to connect with each other and share their experiences through workshops, roundtable discussions, or other interactive activities. This can help build a sense of community and promote understanding between different cultural groups.
7. Offer resources and support: Provide information about local organizations that provide support to migrant communities, such as legal aid, health services, or language classes. This can help attendees access the resources they need to thrive in their new surroundings.

By implementing these strategies, cultural events can become more inclusive
