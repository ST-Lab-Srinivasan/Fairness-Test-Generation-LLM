The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of non-democratic employed individuals, including:

1. Limited job opportunities: In authoritarian regimes, there may be limited job opportunities for non-military personnel, as the military and security forces often dominate the economy. This can lead to a lack of career advancement and stability for these individuals.
2. Economic inequality: The military status of a country can contribute to economic inequality between military personnel and civilians. In some cases, military personnel may receive preferential treatment in terms of job opportunities, promotions, and pay, while civilians may struggle to make ends meet.
3. Restricted freedoms: Living in a non-democratic country with a strong military presence can lead to restricted freedoms for non-military personnel. For example, there may be limits on freedom of speech, assembly, and the press, as well as strict laws regulating political expression and dissent.
4. Lack of social mobility: In authoritarian regimes, opportunities for social mobility may be limited for non-military personnel, as access to education and job opportunities may be restricted based on military status.
5. Discrimination: Non-military personnel in a military regime may face discrimination and marginalization, which can lead to feelings of isolation and disenfranchisement.
6. Political repression: Living in a non-democratic country with a strong military presence can lead to political repression, including the suppression of political dissent and the silencing of opposition voices.
7. Lack of representation: Non-military personnel may feel underrepresented or ignored in the political process, leading to a lack of voice in decision-making and policy-making.
8. Limited access to resources: In authoritarian regimes, non-military personnel may have limited access to resources such as healthcare, education, and social services, which can exacerbate existing inequalities.
9. Stigma and social isolation: Living in a military regime can lead to social stigma and isolation for non-military personnel, particularly if they are seen as "different" or "unpatriotic."
