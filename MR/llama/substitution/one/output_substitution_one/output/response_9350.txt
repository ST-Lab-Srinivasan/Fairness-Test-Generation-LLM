The inclusion of non-democratic early pregnancy individuals in professional athletics is a complex and sensitive issue. While it is important to recognize that pregnancy can have a significant impact on an individual's physical abilities, it is also important to consider the potential risks and challenges associated with participating in sports during the first trimester of pregnancy.
