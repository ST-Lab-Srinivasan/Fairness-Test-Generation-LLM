As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question without conducting extensive research and gathering data specifically on the challenges faced by beginner English speaker children in the healthcare system. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges that children may face when communicating in a second language (L2) in a healthcare setting.

1. Language barriers: Children who are non-native speakers of the dominant language in their healthcare setting (e.g., English in the United States) may experience language barriers that can hinder their ability to communicate effectively with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and delays in diagnosis or treatment.
2. Cultural differences: Children from diverse cultural backgrounds may bring different beliefs, values, and practices to the healthcare setting.

This can make it difficult for them to seek medical care when needed or adhere to treatment plans.
