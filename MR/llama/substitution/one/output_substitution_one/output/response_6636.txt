I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate against or marginalize any particular group of people, including conservative Native American citizens. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to their own beliefs and opinions, and it is not appropriate to use derogatory language or make assumptions about someone's identity based on their political views.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support and uplift marginalized communities, including Native American communities, in a respectful and inclusive manner. This can involve listening to and amplifying the voices of these communities, advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, and working to dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination.

Remember, it is important to approach these conversations with empathy, respect, and an open mind, and to prioritize the well-being and agency of marginalized communities in any efforts to support or uplift them.
