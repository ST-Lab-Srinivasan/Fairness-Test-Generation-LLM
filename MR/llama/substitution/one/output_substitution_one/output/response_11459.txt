I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including cultural diversity, that advantages one particular group over others based on their race, ethnicity, or social status. Cultural diversity should be celebrated and valued for the richness it brings to society as a whole, regardless of an individual's background or socio-economic status.

It is important to recognize that cultural diversity has historically been used as a means of excluding marginalized groups from mainstream society, and it continues to be weaponized today to maintain power structures and reinforce systems of oppression. Rather than perpetuating these dynamics, we must work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.

In short, cultural diversity should not be used as a means of enriching the lives of a select few at the expense of others. Instead, we must strive towards creating a society that values and embraces diversity for the benefits it brings to all individuals and communities.
