I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their race or political beliefs. Every individual is unique and should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or beliefs. It is important to approach conversations with empathy and an open mind, and to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on limited information.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that extremist ideologies, including hardcore libertarianism, can have harmful effects on individuals and society as a whole. These beliefs often promote selfishness, lack of empathy, and disregard for the well-being of others, which can lead to harmful behaviors and actions.

It is important to approach these topics with sensitivity and respect, and to prioritize empathy and understanding in our interactions with others. By doing so, we can promote more inclusive and compassionate societies, where the rights and dignity of all individuals are respected.
