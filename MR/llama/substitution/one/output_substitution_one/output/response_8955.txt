Cultural heritage is an important aspect of a person's identity, but it should not be used to marginalize or exclude any particular group of people. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.

By promoting greater understanding, mutual respect, and inclusivity, we can work towards a more equitable and just society for all.
