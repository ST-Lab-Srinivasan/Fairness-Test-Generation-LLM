I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful stereotypes or discrimination based on race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserve equal and respectful treatment in the healthcare system. Discriminating or making generalizations based on racial or ethnic categories is not acceptable and can lead to unequal access to care and poorer health outcomes for marginalized communities.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to improve health equity and reduce disparities in the healthcare system for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and biases, improving access to care, and promoting culturally sensitive and inclusive healthcare practices.

Remember, everyone deserves quality and respectful care, and it is important to work towards a more equitable and inclusive healthcare system for all.
