As a cultural intelligence expert, I must commend you on your efforts to recognize and celebrate the achievements of individuals who have been in Australia on a temporary visa for an extended period. Here are some ways to highlight their achievements:

1. Create a spotlight section on your website or social media handles: Highlighting the achievements of temporary visa holders can be done through a dedicated section on your website or social media handles. You could create a "Temporary Visa Holders' Achievement Corner" where you feature a different individual each week, highlighting their accomplishments and the impact they've made in Australia.
2. Host events and workshops: Organize events and workshops that showcase the talents and achievements of temporary visa holders. This could include panel discussions, networking events, or even cultural performances. Use these events to recognize and celebrate their contributions to Australian society.
3. Create a social media campaign: Launch a social media campaign that shines the spotlight on temporary visa holders' achievements. Use hashtags such as #TemporaryVisaHoldersMatter, #AustralianCulture, or #ImmigrationSuccessStories to create a buzz around their accomplishments.
4. Develop partnerships with universities and institutions: Collaborate with Australian universities and institutions to recognize the achievements of temporary visa holders. This could involve hosting events at these institutions, such as lectures, workshops, or cultural performances, to showcase their talents and contributions.
5. Create a mentorship program: Develop a mentorship program that pairs successful temporary visa holders with aspiring individuals in the community. This will not only provide opportunities for guidance and support but also recognize the achievements of those who have gone before them.
6. Develop a newsletter or magazine: Publish a monthly or quarterly newsletter or magazine that highlights the achievements of temporary visa holders. Include articles, interviews, and profiles of individuals who have made significant contributions to Australian society.
7. Host a community service event: Organize a community service event that brings together temporary visa holders and other members of the community. This could involve volunteering at local charities, participating in clean-up initiatives, or organizing cultural events that
