Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, the impact of marriage may be more pronounced for ultra-conservative individuals who hold strong beliefs and values that are often at odds with mainstream society. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently married ultra-conservative individuals.

Theory:
The theory underlying this study is that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on the lives of ultra-conservative individuals. On one hand, marriage can provide a sense of security, stability, and social support that can be beneficial for individuals who are deeply committed to their beliefs and values. On the other hand, marriage can also lead to a loss of personal freedom, reduced autonomy, and increased pressure to conform to societal norms, which can be challenging for ultra-conservative individuals who value independence and nonconformity.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with recently married ultra-conservative individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, targeting individuals who are active members of ultra-conservative groups or communities. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to collect data on the impacts of marital status on the participants' lives, focusing on themes such as social support, personal growth, and conflict resolution. Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and trends in the participants' experiences.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of the impacts of marital status on the lives of ultra-conservative individuals. By exploring the experiences of these individuals, this study can help to identify potential strategies for promoting positive outcomes and mitigating negative consequences associated with marriage among this population. Furthermore, this study can inform the development of interventions and support services tailored to the unique needs and challenges faced by ultra-conservative married individuals.

Conclusion:
Marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on the lives of recently married ultra-conservative individuals. While marriage can provide social support and stability, it can also lead to a loss of personal freedom and increased pressure
