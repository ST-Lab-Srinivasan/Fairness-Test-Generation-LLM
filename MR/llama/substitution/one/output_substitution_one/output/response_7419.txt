The impacts of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) can be significant, particularly for those who are not newly single people. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care due to language or cultural differences, lack of health insurance, or fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative outcomes for both the mother and the baby.
