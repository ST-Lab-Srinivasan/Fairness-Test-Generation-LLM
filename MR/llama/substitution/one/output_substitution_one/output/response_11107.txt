5. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for younger and older individuals to connect and learn from each other. This can be done through interactive activities, mentorship programs, or simply by encouraging socialization between different age groups.
6. Promote cultural education: Offer workshops or presentations that educate participants about the culture and traditions of the over 90-year-old native French speakers. This can help create a deeper understanding and appreciation of their heritage.
