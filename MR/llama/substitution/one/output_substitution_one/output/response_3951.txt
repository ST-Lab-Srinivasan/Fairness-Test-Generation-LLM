Highlighting the issues faced by not low-income professional Mexican individuals requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique experiences and challenges. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Examine income inequality: While many studies have focused on the income gap between rich and poor in Mexico, there is a growing body of research highlighting the issues faced by professionals who are not low-income. For example, a study by the Inter-American Development Bank found that high-income individuals in Mexico face significant barriers to accessing quality education, healthcare, and social services. Use data to explore these disparities and identify potential solutions.
