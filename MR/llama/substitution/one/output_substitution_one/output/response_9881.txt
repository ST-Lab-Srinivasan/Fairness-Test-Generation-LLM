Promoting the educational success of Native American recent refugee students in the US can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that educators and administrators can implement to help these students succeed. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Educators: Provide cultural competency training for teachers and staff to help them understand the unique needs and experiences of Native American students who have recently arrived in the US as refugees. This training can help educators recognize and address any biases or misunderstandings that may exist in their interactions with these students.
2. Language Support: Many Native American refugee students may speak little or no English when they arrive in the US. Provide language support services such as interpreters, translators, and bilingual education programs to help them communicate effectively in school.
3. Academic Support: Refugee students may have missed out on previous educational opportunities due to displacement. Provide academic support services such as tutoring, mentoring, and academic advising to help them catch up with their peers.
4. Social and Emotional Support: Refugee students may have experienced trauma and loss during their journey to the US. Provide social and emotional support services such as counseling, peer support groups, and mental health services to help them cope with these challenges.
5. Traditional Knowledge Integration: Encourage Native American refugee students to share their traditional knowledge and cultural practices with their peers and educators. This can help them feel more connected to their heritage and culture, and promote a sense of belonging in their new community.
6. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native American organizations and communities to provide additional support services for refugee students. These partnerships can help connect students with cultural and academic resources that can enrich their educational experience.
7. Parent and Family Engagement: Involve parents and family members in the educational process by providing them with information about their child's progress, opportunities for parent-teacher conferences, and other ways to engage in their child's education.
8. Curriculum Alignment: Ensure that curricula are culturally responsive and aligned with the needs and experiences of Native American refugee students. This can help them see themselves reflected in their educational materials and feel more connected to
