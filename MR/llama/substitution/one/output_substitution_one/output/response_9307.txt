The social inclusion of native Spanish speakers who have recently gone through a divorce or separation can be challenging, especially if they have been married multiple times. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Allow them to express their emotions and concerns without judgment. Listen actively and empathetically, and validate their feelings to help them feel heard and understood.
2. Encourage social activities: Suggest social activities that they might enjoy, such as joining a book club, playing sports, or participating in hobby groups. This can help them meet new people and build friendships outside of their existing social circle.
3. Help them connect with others: Introduce them to other single friends or acquaintances who have gone through similar experiences. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to a supportive community.
4. Offer practical support: Help them with practical tasks such as childcare, household chores, or errands, which can help reduce their stress levels and give them more time to focus on their own well-being.
5. Respect their boundaries: Be sensitive to their needs and respect their boundaries if they don't feel comfortable socializing or discussing certain topics. Allow them to process their emotions at their own pace, without pressure to "get over it."
6. Provide a safe space: Create a safe and non-judgmental space where they can express themselves freely, without fear of criticism or rejection. This can help them feel more comfortable opening up about their feelings and experiences.
7. Encourage self-care: Support them in practicing self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, or creative pursuits. These activities can help them manage stress and improve their overall well-being.
8. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that healing from a divorce or separation takes time, and be patient with them as they navigate this process. Understand that they may need time to heal and reflect on their experiences before they are ready to socialize again.
9. Offer resources: Provide them with resources such as counseling services, support groups, or books that can help them cope with the challenges of divorce or separation.
10. Be a positive influence: Surround them with positive influences and support
