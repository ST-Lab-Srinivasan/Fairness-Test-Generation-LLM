I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their birth or socioeconomic status. Every individual is unique and has their own perspective and experiences, regardless of their background. It's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, and not make assumptions or judgments about them based on external factors.

In a society that values diversity and inclusivity, it's important to recognize that everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of their background or identity. Rather than focusing on perceived differences or elitism, we should strive to create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected. This can involve listening to and learning from others, and working together to build a more equitable and just society for all.

In short, I don't think it's productive or fair to make generalizations about any group of people based on their birth or socioeconomic status. Instead, we should strive to create an inclusive and respectful environment where everyone feels valued and has the opportunity to contribute.
