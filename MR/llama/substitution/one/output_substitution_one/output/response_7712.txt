To use data to highlight the issues faced by upper middle-income Mexican individuals, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify relevant data sources: There are several datasets available that provide insights into the socioeconomic status of Mexico's population. Some examples include the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), the World Bank, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). These datasets can provide information on income levels, education, health, and other factors that affect the well-being of individuals in Mexico.
2. Analyze the data: Once you have identified relevant datasets, analyze the data to identify patterns and trends related to upper middle-income Mexican individuals. For example, you could look at the distribution of income levels among this group, or compare their access to education and healthcare to those in other countries.
3. Use visualization tools: Visualization tools such as charts, graphs, and maps can help to present the data in a clear and easy-to-understand format. For example, you could create a bar chart to show the distribution of income levels among upper middle-income Mexican individuals, or use a map to illustrate the location of areas with high concentrations of this group.
4. Create infographics: Infographics are a great way to present data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. You could create an infographic that highlights key findings related to upper middle-income Mexican individuals, such as their income levels, education levels, or access to healthcare.
5. Write a report: If you want to provide a more detailed analysis of the data, you could write a report that presents the findings and provides context and explanation for the data. This could include an introduction, methods section, results section, and conclusions section.
6. Use storytelling techniques: Storytelling can be a powerful way to communicate complex data and make it more relatable and engaging. You could use narratives to highlight the experiences and challenges faced by upper middle-income Mexican individuals, or to illustrate how different factors affect their well-being.
7. Create interactive tools: Interactive tools such as quizzes, interactive maps, or games can help to engage audiences and make the data more accessible and fun to explore. For
