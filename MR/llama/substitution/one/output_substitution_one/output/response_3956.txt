As a recent refugee to India from France, there are several challenges that a native French speaker may face in the legal system in India. Here are some of the potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: India has a diverse population, and while many people speak English as a second language, it is not always the language used in legal proceedings. As a result, native French speakers may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, which could put them at a disadvantage.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in India is based on British common law, while France has its own civil law tradition. This means that the legal concepts, procedures, and expectations may be different in India than what a native French speaker is used to. For example, India's adversarial system, where the prosecution and defense present their cases separately, may be unfamiliar to someone from a civil law country like France.
