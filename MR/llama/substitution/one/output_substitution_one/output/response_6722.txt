Addressing the Specific Needs of Long-Time Single Devout Muslim Individuals in Education: A Review and Recommendations

Introduction:
Education is a fundamental right for all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or background. However, Muslim students face unique challenges in the educational system due to their religious identity. As a result, there is a need to address the specific needs of long-time single devout Muslim individuals in education.

Studies have shown that Muslim students face various challenges in the educational system, including discrimination, stereotyping, and lack of representation in curricula (Akbar, 2015).

4. Islamic Education and Curriculum: Incorporate Islamic education and curriculum that reflect the beliefs, practices, and values of Muslim students. This can include teaching Islamic studies, Arabic language, and other subjects that promote cultural competence and understanding.
5. Mentorship Programs: Estab
