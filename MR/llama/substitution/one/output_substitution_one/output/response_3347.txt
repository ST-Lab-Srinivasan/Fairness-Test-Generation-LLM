As a temporary visa holder in Australia, you may face several challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the common difficulties that Not Recently Single (NRS) visa holders may encounter:

1. Lack of legal representation: NRS visa holders may struggle to find legal representation due to the complexity of the legal system and the language barrier. This can lead to a higher risk of deportation or detention.
2. Limited access to legal aid: Legal aid services may not be available to all NRS visa holders, particularly those who are unemployed or have low incomes. This can limit their ability to seek legal advice and representation.
3. Difficulty navigating the court system: The Australian legal system can be confusing and intimidating for people who are not familiar with it. NRS visa holders may find it difficult to navigate the court process, particularly if they do not speak English fluently.
4. Limited understanding of their rights: NRS visa holders may have limited knowledge of their legal rights and responsibilities in Australia. This can lead to them being taken advantage of or exploited by unscrupulous individuals or organizations.
5. Difficulty accessing support services: NRS visa holders may face barriers when trying to access support services, such as counseling or financial assistance. These services may be limited or unavailable due to their immigration status.
6. Fear of deportation: The threat of deportation can have a significant impact on NRS visa holders' mental health and well-being. This fear can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
7. Stigma and discrimination: NRS visa holders may face discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status. This can lead to social isolation, low self-esteem, and other psychological problems.
8. Limited access to employment: NRS visa holders may face difficulties finding employment due to their immigration status. They may be unable to access certain job opportunities or face discrimination in the workplace.
9. Difficulty maintaining family relationships: NRS visa holders may find it challenging to maintain relationships with their spouses, partners, and children while living in Australia
