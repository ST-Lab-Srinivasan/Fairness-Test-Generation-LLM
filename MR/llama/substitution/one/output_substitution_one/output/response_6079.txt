Creating more inclusive cultural events for partnered active-duty individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies to make these events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Understand the needs of military partners: It's essential to understand the unique challenges faced by military partners, such as frequent moves, deployment, and stress. Consider their needs when planning cultural events, and offer accommodations where possible.
2. Provide childcare options: Many cultural events may not be suitable for children, but providing childcare options can help ease the burden on parents who want to attend. Consider partnering with local organizations that provide childcare services during events.
3. Offer flexible attendance options: Military partners may have limited time off due to deployment or training schedules. Offer flexible attendance options, such as virtual events or pre-recorded content, to make it easier for them to participate.
4. Incorporate military-themed elements: Incorporating elements of military culture, such as flag displays or patriotic music, can help make the event more inclusive for military partners. This can also help create a sense of community and belonging.
5. Provide accessible venues: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair-accessible and has adequate parking and transportation options. This can help ensure that all attendees, including those with disabilities, can fully participate in the event.
6. Offer inclusive programming: Incorporate a variety of activities and entertainment options to cater to different interests and preferences. This can include musical performances, dance classes, or art exhibitions that reflect the cultural diversity of the military community.
7. Encourage participation: Encourage military partners to participate in event planning and decision-making processes. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and make them feel more invested in the event's success.
8. Provide resources for deployment support: Military partners may face unique challenges during deployment. Offer resources such as counseling services, deployment support groups, or online forums where they can connect with other military partners who are going through similar experiences.
9. Celebrate military culture: Incorporate elements of military culture, such as uniforms, medals, or military history,
