I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions that may promote discrimination or inequality towards any particular group of people, including devout Hindu heterosexual students. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to equal opportunities and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on creating an inclusive and supportive educational environment for all students, regardless of their background or beliefs. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, such as:

1. Providing training and resources for teachers and staff to recognize and address biases and discrimination.
2. Creating safe spaces for students to express themselves and feel supported.
3. Offering diverse and inclusive curricula that reflect the experiences and perspectives of all students.
4. Encouraging student involvement in decision-making processes and leadership opportunities.
5. Fostering a culture of respect, empathy, and understanding towards differences.

By promoting these values, educational institutions can help ensure that all students feel valued, included, and empowered to succeed, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
