Ensuring that the voices of native Spanish speakers, including recent refugees to the US, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide language accessibility services such as interpreters, translators, and bilingual staff in government agencies, community organizations, and healthcare settings. This will enable refugees to fully participate in decision-making processes, regardless of their proficiency in English.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training for government officials, community leaders, and service providers. This will help them understand the unique needs and experiences of native Spanish speakers and refugees, enabling them to provide more effective support and representation.
3. Community Engagement: Foster a culture of community engagement by involving native Spanish speakers and refugees in decision-making processes through mechanisms such as community advisory boards, focus groups, and surveys. This will ensure that their voices are heard and valued in the development of policies and programs.
4. Advocacy and Leadership Development: Support the advocacy and leadership development efforts of native Spanish speakers and refugees through training, mentorship, and networking opportunities. This can help build their capacity to effectively advocate for their rights and interests within decision-making processes.
5. Collaborative Partnerships: Establish collaborative partnerships between government agencies, community organizations, and native Spanish speakers and refugees. These partnerships can help ensure that the voices of these groups are heard and valued in decision-making processes, and can promote more inclusive policies and programs.
6. Public Education Campaigns: Implement public education campaigns targeting native Spanish speakers and refugees to raise awareness about their rights and entitlements, as well as the resources available to them. This can help increase their participation in decision-making processes by ensuring they are informed and empowered.
7. Capacity Building: Provide capacity building opportunities for native Spanish speakers and refugees to enhance their skills and knowledge in areas such as leadership, advocacy, and community organizing. This can help them become more effective in influencing decision-making processes and promoting their rights.
