Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American recent refugees to the US, as it provides a sense of connection to their ancestors and traditional ways of life. For many Native Americans, cultural heritage is an essential aspect of their identity, and it helps them maintain a sense of continuity with their past and cultural traditions.

However, for recent refugees who have been displaced from their homelands due to conflict or persecution, cultural heritage can be particularly important in helping them find a sense of belonging and identity in their new surroundings. It can provide a sense of familiarity and comfort in an unfamiliar environment, and it can help them maintain a connection to their cultural roots despite the challenges they may face in their new home.

For agnostic individuals who have been displaced from their homelands, cultural heritage can also play a role in shaping their identities. While religion may not be a central aspect of their identity, cultural heritage can provide a sense of connection to their ancestors and traditional ways of life, which can be an important source of comfort and strength in the face of displacement.

In both cases, cultural heritage can help individuals maintain a sense of identity and belonging, even in the face of significant challenges and disruptions. It can provide a sense of continuity and connection to the past, which can be especially important for those who have been forced to leave their homelands and start anew in a foreign land.
