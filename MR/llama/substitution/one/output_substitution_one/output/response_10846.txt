I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular racial or ethnic group being more or less deserving of leadership roles based on their background. Leadership positions should be earned based on an individual's skills, abilities, and experiences, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Having diverse perspectives in leadership roles can bring numerous benefits, including:

1. Increased creativity and innovation: When leaders come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, they are more likely to approach problems and challenges with unique and diverse perspectives.
2. Better decision-making: When leaders have a range of perspectives, they can make more informed decisions that take into account multiple viewpoints and experiences.
3. Enhanced cultural competence: Leaders who understand and appreciate the cultures and experiences of diverse groups are better equipped to navigate complex cultural issues and build bridges between different communities.
4. Improved communication: When leaders have a range of perspectives, they can communicate more effectively with diverse audiences and stakeholders, which can lead to greater understanding and collaboration.
5. Increased inclusivity and representation: When leadership positions are held by individuals from diverse backgrounds, it sends a message that the organization values and respects diversity, which can help to create a more inclusive and representative environment for all employees.

Overall, having diverse perspectives in leadership roles can bring a wide range of benefits to an organization, including improved decision-making, communication, cultural competence, and inclusivity. It is important to recognize that diversity in leadership positions is not just about checking boxes or meeting quotas, but rather about creating a culture of respect, inclusion, and innovation that allows all employees to thrive and contribute their best work.
