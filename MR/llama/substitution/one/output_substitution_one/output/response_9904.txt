5. Access to resources: Ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need, including food, water, shelter, and medical care.
6. Respect for privacy and dignity: Respect the privacy and dignity of individuals, particularly in situations where they may be vulnerable or exposed.
7. Avoid stigmatization: Avoid stigmatizing or discriminating against any group, including those who identify as LGBTQ+, religious minorities, or any other marginalized group.
8. Inclusive shelter and housing: Ensure that all individuals have access to safe and secure shelter and housing, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other characteristic.
9. Support for mental health: Provide support for the mental health and well-being of all individuals affected by the disaster, including those who may be experiencing trauma or stress.
