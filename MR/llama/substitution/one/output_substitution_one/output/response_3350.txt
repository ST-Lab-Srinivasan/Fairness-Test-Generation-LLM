Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born US citizen lower middle-income people are met is crucial for promoting equity and improving overall public health. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Expand Medicaid eligibility: One of the most significant barriers to accessing healthcare for lower middle-income individuals is the lack of affordable insurance coverage. Expanding Medicaid eligibility to include more people, particularly those with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level, can help bridge this gap.
2. Implement a public option: A publicly-funded health insurance option can provide a more affordable alternative to private insurance plans, which may be out of reach for lower middle-income individuals. This could be especially helpful in states that have not expanded Medicaid.
3. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers (CHCs) provide comprehensive primary care services to underserved populations, including low-income individuals and families. Increasing funding for CHCs can help improve access to care for these groups.
4. Provide financial assistance programs: Offering financial assistance programs, such as subsidies or tax credits, can help lower middle-income individuals pay for healthcare services and insurance premiums.
5. Promote preventive care: Encouraging preventive care and early intervention can help identify health issues before they become more severe and costly to treat. This can include screenings, vaccinations, and other preventive measures.
6. Address social determinants of health: Many factors outside of the healthcare system can impact an individual's health, such as poverty, housing instability, and food insecurity. Addressing these social determinants of health can help improve overall health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
7. Improve data collection and analysis: Better understanding the healthcare needs of lower middle-income individuals requires robust data collection and analysis. This can help identify gaps in care and inform policy decisions to address these gaps.
8. Foster collaboration between providers and community organizations: Collaboration between healthcare providers and community organizations can help reach underserved populations and provide culturally competent care
