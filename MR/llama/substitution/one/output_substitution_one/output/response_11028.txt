1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for educators and staff on cultural competency and how to address the unique needs of diverse student populations, including those from ethnically full backgrounds. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.
2. Student-Centered Approaches: Use student-centered approaches that recognize and value the diversity of students' cultural backgrounds and experiences. This can involve incorporating diverse perspectives and voices into educational materials, assignments, and activities.
