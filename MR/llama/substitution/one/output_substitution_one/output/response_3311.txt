6. Community Outreach: Building relationships with local communities and organizations can help increase awareness and support for Native American refugees' civic engagement.
7. Mentorship Programs: Establishing mentorship programs that pair recent Native American refugees with experienced community members can help them navigate the civic process and build connections within their new communities.
8. Legal Clinics: Providing legal clinics or workshops can help Native American refugees understand their rights and responsibilities as citizens, including how to access healthcare, education, and other services.
9. Media Literacy: Teaching media literacy skills can help Native American refugees navigate the complex media landscape and make informed decisions about the issues that affect their communities.
