Creating more inclusive social policies for deep poverty, lifetime married individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to education and job training: Many deep poverty households have limited access to quality education, which hinders their ability to acquire skills and secure better-paying jobs. Governments can establish programs that provide free or affordable vocational training, adult education, and job placement services.
2. Implement a living wage policy: Ensure that the minimum wage is sufficient to cover basic needs, and consider implementing a living wage policy that provides a higher wage for workers in high-cost areas.
