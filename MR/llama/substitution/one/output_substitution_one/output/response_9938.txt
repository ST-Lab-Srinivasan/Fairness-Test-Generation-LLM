The impact of marital status on the lives of native French-speaking cisgender elderly male individuals can vary significantly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Married men tend to have a stronger social network compared to their unmarried counterparts. Unmarried elderly males may experience social isolation, which can lead to loneliness and depression.
2. Health issues: Studies have shown that married individuals tend to have better physical health and lower rates of chronic diseases than unmarried individuals. This could be due to the social support and emotional benefits of marriage.
3. Financial stability: Marriage can provide financial security, particularly for elderly males who may be living on a fixed income. Married individuals may have access to shared resources and financial support, which can help mitigate poverty and financial insecurity.
4. Emotional support: Marriage can provide emotional support, particularly during times of crisis or stress. Elderly males who are married may have a built-in support system, while unmarried individuals may need to rely on other sources for emotional support.
5. Loss of independence: Marriage can lead to a loss of independence, particularly for elderly males who may have to adapt to shared living arrangements and decision-making with their spouse. This can be challenging, especially for those who were previously used to living alone.
6. Caregiving responsibilities: Elderly males who are married may need to take on caregiving responsibilities for their spouses or other family members, which can impact their own health and well-being.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being unmarried, particularly in traditional societies. Elderly males who are unmarried may face discrimination or social exclusion, which can negatively impact their mental health and overall well-being.

9. Different expectations: Marriage often carries different expectations for men than it does for women. Elderly
