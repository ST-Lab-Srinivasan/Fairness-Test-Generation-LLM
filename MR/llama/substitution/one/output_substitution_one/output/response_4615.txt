As a beginner Spanish speaker and a recent refugee to the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system. Here are some potential difficulties:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for refugees is the language barrier. Many court processes and documents are only available in English, which can make it difficult for those who do not speak English fluently to navigate the system.
2. Lack of cultural knowledge: Refugees may be unfamiliar with the legal processes and customs in the US, which can lead to confusion and misunderstandings.
3. Limited access to resources: Refugees may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, interpreters, and translations of important documents.
4. Difficulty navigating the immigration court system: The immigration court system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with the process.
5. Lack of trust in the system: Refugees may have had negative experiences with the legal system in their home country or during their journey to the US, which can make it difficult for them to trust the system and feel comfortable seeking help from legal professionals.
6. Difficulty understanding the legal terminology: Legal terms and concepts may be unfamiliar to refugees who are not fluent in Spanish, which can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and responsibilities in the legal system.
7. Limited access to social services: Refugees may have limited access to social services such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities, which can impact their ability to navigate the legal system.
8. Difficulty navigating the criminal justice system: Refugees who are also undocumented immigrants may be at risk of deportation and detention if they interact with law enforcement agencies.
9. Lack of knowledge about their rights: Refugees may not know their legal rights and responsibilities, which can lead to difficulties in navigating the legal system.
10. Trauma and stress: Refugees may have experienced trauma and stress during their journey to the US, which can impact their ability to navigate the legal system and access necessary resources.

It's important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the individual's circumstances and experiences. However
