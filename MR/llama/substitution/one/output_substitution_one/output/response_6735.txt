Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-long-time single individuals requires understanding and addressing the unique needs and experiences of this demographic. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Be aware of the language used: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is in a romantic relationship or has family. Use inclusive language that acknowledges the diversity of relationships, such as "significant other" instead of "spouse."
2. Involve non-long-time single individuals in planning and decision-making processes: Encourage non-long-time single individuals to participate in event planning and decision-making to ensure their needs are met.
3. Offer options for participation: Provide opportunities for non-long-time single individuals to participate in cultural celebrations, such as attending events alone or with friends, or creating their own cultural experiences.
4. Avoid reinforcing traditional gender roles: Be mindful of how cultural celebrations may perpetuate traditional gender roles and stereotypes. Encourage gender-neutral activities and give individuals the freedom to express themselves in ways that feel authentic to them.
5. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that all individuals feel welcome and included during cultural celebrations. This can be achieved by providing clear instructions on how to participate, being sensitive to cultural differences, and creating a safe and inclusive space for everyone.
6. Highlight the diversity of relationships: Celebrate the diversity of relationships and acknowledge that they come in many forms. Use language that is inclusive of all relationship types, such as "partner" or "significant other."
7. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to non-long-time single individuals who may be struggling with cultural celebrations. This can include providing information on how to navigate cultural events alone or with friends, or offering counseling services for those who are feeling isolated or left out.
8. Encourage self-expression: Encourage non-long-time single individuals to express themselves in ways that feel authentic and meaningful to them. Provide opportunities for creative expression, such as through art or music, and acknowledge the value of individuality.
9. Address power dynamics: Be aware of power dynamics within cultural celebrations and address any issues
