Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of Native natural-born US citizens, particularly those over the age of 90. Here are some ways mentorship can impact their growth and well-being:

1. Cultural preservation: Elders and mentors can share their knowledge and experiences about their tribe's culture, language, and traditions with younger generations. This helps preserve the cultural heritage of Native American communities and ensures that these values are passed down to future generations.
2. Personal growth: Mentorship can help individuals develop a sense of identity and purpose. Elders and mentors can provide guidance on how to navigate life's challenges, make informed decisions, and build resilience. This personal growth can lead to increased self-esteem, confidence, and overall well-being.
3. Community involvement: Mentorship can foster a sense of community involvement and social responsibility. Elders and mentors can encourage younger generations to participate in cultural events, volunteer in their communities, or take on leadership roles. This helps build stronger, more cohesive Native American communities.
4. Leadership development: Mentorship can help develop future leaders within Native American communities. Elders and mentors can provide guidance on how to lead with integrity, empathy, and cultural sensitivity. This leadership development can help ensure the continued growth and success of Native American communities.
5. Historical understanding: Mentorship can help younger generations understand their tribe's history and the challenges faced throughout the years. Elders and mentors can share stories of resilience, perseverance, and cultural preservation, providing a deeper appreciation for the struggles and accomplishments of Native American communities.
6. Traditional knowledge transmission: Mentorship can ensure the transmission of traditional ecological knowledge and skills from one generation to the next. Elders and mentors can teach younger generations about plant medicine, hunting and gathering practices, and other traditional ways of living in harmony with nature.
7. Language preservation: Mentorship can help preserve Native American languages by teaching younger generations their native language and cultural expressions. This linguistic and cultural diversity is crucial for the survival of Native American communities.
