Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Native and Recent Immigrant Caucasian Individuals in the US

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those from diverse backgrounds. In the United States, recent immigrants and Native Americans have unique experiences that impact their cultural identities. This paper explores how cultural heritage influences the formation of identities among these groups.

The intersectionality of these experiences highlights the need for greater understanding and inclusivity in shaping identities.

Cultural Preservation:
Cultural preservation is crucial in shaping the identities of Native Americans and recent immigrants. Efforts to preserve traditional practices, languages, and
