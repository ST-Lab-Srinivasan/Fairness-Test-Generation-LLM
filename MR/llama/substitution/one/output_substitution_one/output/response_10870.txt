As a recent refugee to the United States, beginner Arabic speakers may face several challenges when navigating the legal system. Here are some of the common obstacles they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge faced by beginner Arabic speakers is the language barrier. Arabic is a non-English language, and many legal documents, forms, and proceedings are only available in English. This can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and responsibilities under US law.
2. Lack of access to legal resources: Refugees may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or online resources that can provide them with information on their rights and responsibilities. This can make it harder for them to navigate the legal system and access the help they need.
3. Cultural differences: The US legal system is based on common law, which may be unfamiliar to those from countries with different legal systems. Additionally, cultural norms and expectations around gender roles, family structure, and social interactions may be different in the US than what refugees are used to in their home countries.
4. Lack of trust: Refugees may have had negative experiences with authority figures in their home countries or during their migration process. This can make it difficult for them to trust law enforcement agencies, courts, and other legal authorities in the US.
5. Fear of deportation: Many refugees are under constant fear of deportation, which can make them hesitant to seek legal assistance or access legal resources. They may feel that seeking help could lead to their removal from the country.
6. Limited knowledge of immigration laws and procedures: Refugees may have limited knowledge of US immigration laws and procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system. This can lead to mistakes or misunderstandings that can have serious consequences.
7. Difficulty navigating the court system: The US court system can be complex and overwhelming, especially for those who are not familiar with the language or cultural norms. Refugees may struggle to find their way around courthouses, understand legal terminology, or navigate the different levels of court systems.
8. Limited access to financial resources: Many refugees have limited financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to afford legal representation
