Lifelong married civilian people, or those who have been married for a long time and have a stable personal life, may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Stereotypes and biases: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma associated with being a married person in the workplace. Some employers may assume that married people are less committed to their jobs or have other priorities than single people. These stereotypes can lead to discrimination and limited opportunities for advancement.
