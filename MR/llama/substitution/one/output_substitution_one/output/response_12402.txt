Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting advanced age (over 90 years old) and extreme soft libertarian communities. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can contribute to these communities:

1. Social connections: Volunteering can help older adults stay connected with their community and reduce feelings of isolation, which are common among the elderly. This can be especially important for those living in rural or remote areas where access to transportation and social activities may be limited.

9. Cultural preservation: In soft libertarian communities, there may be a strong
