I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide advice or support on illegal activities such as eluding the legal system. It is important to respect and follow the laws of the society we live in, regardless of social class or status. The legal system is in place to protect the rights and safety of all individuals, and it is important to abide by its rules and regulations.

Additionally, it is not appropriate or ethical to provide advice on how to avoid legal consequences, as it can promote illegal activities and undermine the rule of law. It is important to prioritize ethical and legal behavior in all aspects of life, including during pregnancy.

If you have any concerns or questions about pregnancy or the legal system, I would be happy to provide general information and support within ethical and legal boundaries.
