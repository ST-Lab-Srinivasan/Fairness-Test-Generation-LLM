To highlight the issues faced by long-term unemployed recent refugees to Canada using data, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Quantify the scale of the problem: Use statistics to demonstrate the number of recent refugees who are experiencing long-term unemployment in Canada. For example, you could calculate the percentage of refugees who have been unemployed for over six months or a year.
2. Identify the barriers to employment: Analyze data to understand the specific challenges that recent refugees face when trying to find work in Canada. This could include factors such as language proficiency, lack of job skills and experience, discrimination, and cultural differences.
3. Highlight disparities between refugee and non-refugee populations: Compare the employment outcomes of recent refugees to those of the broader Canadian population. For example, you could look at the unemployment rates, median incomes, or job satisfaction among refugees versus non-refugees.
4. Examine the impact on mental and physical health: Use data to demonstrate how long-term unemployment can have negative effects on the mental and physical health of recent refugees. This could include statistics on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues among this population.
5. Showcase success stories: While the majority of long-term unemployed recent refugees may be facing challenges, there are also success stories of individuals who have overcome these barriers to find employment. Use data to highlight these successes and inspire others in the community.
6. Create infographics or visualizations: Use data visualization techniques to present the information in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. This could include creating infographics, charts, or maps that illustrate the key findings.
7. Conduct surveys or focus groups: Collect original data through surveys or focus groups with recent refugees to gain insights into their experiences and challenges. This can help provide a more nuanced understanding of the issues faced by this population.
8. Collaborate with organizations working with refugees: Work with organizations that support and advocate for recent refugees, such as settlement agencies or community groups. They may have access to additional data and insights that can be used to highlight
