Documented not recently single (NRS) individuals face unique challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges arise from the intersection of their immigration status, socioeconomic factors, and healthcare access. Some of the specific challenges faced by NRS individuals include:

1. Language barriers: Many NRS individuals may not speak fluent English or the language of the country they are living in, making it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers and understand medical information.
2. Limited access to healthcare: NRS individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to their immigration status, such as being uninsured or underinsured, which can lead to delayed or lack of care.
3. Cultural and linguistic competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained in the cultural and linguistic needs of NRS individuals, leading to a lack of culturally competent care.
4. Lack of health insurance: Many NRS individuals are uninsured or underinsured, which can limit their access to preventive care, chronic disease management, and other essential health services.
5. Limited awareness of available resources: NRS individuals may be unaware of the healthcare resources available to them, such as community clinics, sliding-scale fees, or Medicaid programs.
6. Discrimination and stigma: NRS individuals may experience discrimination and stigma within the healthcare system, which can lead to a lack of trust in healthcare providers and systems.
7. Mental health challenges: NRS individuals may face unique mental health challenges, such as anxiety, depression, and trauma, due to their immigration experiences and circumstances.
8. Health disparities: NRS individuals may experience health disparities due to inadequate access to healthcare, poor living conditions, and limited access to healthy food and exercise opportunities.
9. Limited access to specialized care: NRS individuals may have difficulty accessing specialized care, such as cancer treatment or organ transplants, due to their immigration status or lack of insurance coverage.
10. Lack of advocacy: NRS individuals may not have access to advocates who can help them navigate the healthcare system and address language barriers, cultural differences, and other challenges.
