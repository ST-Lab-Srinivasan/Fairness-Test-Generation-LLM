The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of mid-50s individuals who are just above the poverty line can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial burden: Genetic conditions can lead to increased healthcare costs, including doctor visits, medications, and hospitalizations. This can put a significant strain on individuals who are already living near the poverty line.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Individuals with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area. This can exacerbate the condition and reduce their quality of life.
