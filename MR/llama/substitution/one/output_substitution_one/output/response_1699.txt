I cannot provide recommendations or endorse any actions that promote discrimination, exclusion, or inequality based on race, ethnicity, or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity and individuality of all people, regardless of their cultural background or socioeconomic status.

Celebrating the cultural contributions of a particular group of people, including those who are considered part of an "elite" class, should not be done at the expense of marginalizing or ignoring the contributions of other groups. Instead, it is important to promote inclusivity and mutual respect among all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.

Here are some ways to celebrate and appreciate the cultural contributions of diverse groups without perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination:

1. Learn about and appreciate the history, traditions, and customs of different cultures through education and exposure.
2. Support and promote inclusive and diverse representation in media, arts, and other forms of expression.
3. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion in all aspects of society.
4. Engage in respectful dialogue and cross-cultural exchange to foster understanding and empathy.
5. Avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background.

Remember, celebrating the diversity of cultures is not a zero-sum game where one group's contributions must be elevated at the expense of another. Instead, it is about recognizing and valuing the unique perspectives and experiences of all individuals and groups, and working towards a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
