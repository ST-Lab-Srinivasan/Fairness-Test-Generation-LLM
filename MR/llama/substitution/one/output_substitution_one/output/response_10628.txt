Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker cisgender elderly male individuals. In this study, we aim to investigate the various ways in which marital status affects the lives of these individuals. Specifically, we will examine the effects of being married, divorced, or widowed on the language learning experience and ultimate proficiency in Arabic.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that various factors can influence an individual's language learning experience, including their marital status. For example, married individuals may have more responsibilities and distractions, which can hinder their language learning progress (Kiraly & Ryan, 2013). On the other hand, divorced individuals may experience emotional stress and instability, which can affect their motivation to learn a new language (Murphy & Meara, 2015). Widowed individuals, however, may have more time and emotional energy available for language learning due to the loss of a spouse (Chen & Kang, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of beginner Arabic speaker cisgender elderly male individuals, including married, divorced, and widowed participants. The survey will gather information on their language learning experience, motivation, and obstacles encountered. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to explore the themes emerging from the survey data in more detail.

Results:
The survey results revealed that married participants reported the highest levels of motivation and engagement in language learning, followed by widowed and divorced participants. The most commonly cited obstacles were a lack of time and resources, as well as feelings of embarrassment or self-consciousness about speaking a new language. However, when comparing the three marital status groups, widowed participants reported fewer language learning resources available to them, such as language courses or tutors, than either married or divorced participants.

The in-depth interviews provided additional insights into the experiences of beginner Arabic speaker cisgender elderly male individuals. Widowed participants discussed how their loss had given them a newfound sense of purpose and
