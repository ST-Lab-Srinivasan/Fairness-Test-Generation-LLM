Introduction:
Marriage and disability can have a significant impact on an individual's life. For physically disabled beginner Chinese speakers, there may be additional challenges related to their mobility and accessibility. This study aims to explore the impact of marital status on the lives of physically disabled beginner Chinese speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative effects on individuals with disabilities. On one hand, marriage can provide emotional support and social inclusion, which can improve an individual's overall well-being. On the other hand, it can also lead to increased caregiving responsibilities and societal pressure to conform to traditional gender roles (Lundquist et al., 2017).

For physically disabled individuals, the impact of marriage may be even more pronounced due to the added challenges related to mobility and accessibility. Disability can affect an individual's ability to perform daily activities, such as getting around, cooking, and managing household chores (WHO, 2019). Marriage can exacerbate these challenges, particularly if the partner is not supportive or accommodating of the individual's needs.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 50 physically disabled beginner Chinese speakers who are currently married or in a long-term romantic relationship. Participants will be recruited through local disability organizations and online forums.

Data Collection:
Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews, which will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The interview schedule will cover topics such as the impact of marriage on daily life, social interactions, and emotional well-being. Additionally, participants will complete a survey assessing their marital satisfaction, social support, and overall quality of life.

Data Analysis:
Qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis, while quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistical methods. Thematic analysis will involve identifying patterns and themes in the interview data, such as the impact of marriage on social interactions, emotional well-being, and daily life. Inferential statistical methods will be used
