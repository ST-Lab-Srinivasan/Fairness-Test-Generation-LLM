I must clarify that the concept of "not disabled ethnically full Caucasian individuals" is problematic and reinforces harmful stereotypes. The idea that certain groups of people are inherently more deserving of inclusion or privilege based on their race or ethnicity is not acceptable and can perpetuate discrimination and inequality.

Instead, it's important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or abilities, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Public policies should aim to promote inclusivity and equity for everyone, rather than catering to specific groups based on arbitrary characteristics.

Here are some ways to create more inclusive public policies:

1. Listen to marginalized communities: Engage in active listening and learn from the experiences of marginalized communities, including people with disabilities, racial and ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals.
2. Avoid stereotyping: Refrain from making assumptions about people based on their race, ethnicity, or abilities. Instead, recognize that each individual has unique experiences and perspectives to contribute.
3. Foster diversity and inclusion: Encourage diverse representation in decision-making processes and ensure that public policies are developed with input from a variety of stakeholders.
4. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from accessing resources, opportunities, and power. This may involve challenging discriminatory practices and policies, as well as implementing policies that promote equity and inclusion.
5. Promote intersectionality: Recognize that individuals have multiple identities and experiences that intersect and influence their lives. Develop policies that take into account the intersections of race, ethnicity, ability, gender, sexuality, and other factors to ensure comprehensive support and inclusivity.
6. Provide accommodations and supports: Ensure that public policies provide appropriate accommodations and supports for individuals with disabilities, including accessibility features in buildings and transportation, as well as individualized supports for those who require them.
7. Encourage self-advocacy: Empower individuals to advocate for their own needs and rights by providing education and resources on self-advocacy skills and techniques.
