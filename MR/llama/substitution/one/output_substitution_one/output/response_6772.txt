Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deep in poverty but have experienced multiple episodes of poverty requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and provides sustainable support. Here are some strategies that can help:

3. Foster job skills training: Provide training and education programs that teach individuals valuable job skills, such as computer literacy, communication, and problem-solving. This can help them find better-paying jobs and reduce their likelihood of experiencing future episodes of poverty.
4. Promote affordable housing: Develop affordable housing options, such as rent subsidies or homeownership programs, to help individuals and families maintain stable living arrangements during periods of poverty.
