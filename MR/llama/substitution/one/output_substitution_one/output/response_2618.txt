Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who are recently single or have experienced multiple romantic breakups. In the context of Arabic speakers, cultural heritage can influence their perceptions of themselves and their place in society. This paper will explore the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of recently single or multiple times beginner Arabic speaker individuals.

The role of cultural heritage in shaping identity:

The loss of a romantic partner can be particularly challenging for individuals who have strong cultural and religious values that prioritize the importance of family and community (Al-Ali & Al-Shammari, 2016).

Identity formation and cultural heritage:
The loss of a romantic partner can lead to identity confusion and self-doubt, particularly for individuals who have not experienced such losses before. Cultural heritage can play a significant role in shaping an individual's identity during this time (Hood, 2016).

Cultural heritage can also influence how individuals perceive themselves in relation to others. In Arab cultures, gender roles are often rigidly defined, with men expected to be breadwinners and women expected to be caregivers (Al-Ali & Al-Shammari, 2016). The loss of a romantic partner can challenge these traditional gender roles and lead to identity confusion (Ham
