Promoting the educational success of recent refugee students with physical disabilities in Canada requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility measures: Ensure that schools and classrooms are accessible to students with physical disabilities. Provide ramps, elevators, and adaptive equipment as needed.
2. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as extra time to complete assignments, a quiet room for test-taking, or the use of assistive technology.
3. Inclusive teaching practices: Train teachers on inclusive teaching practices that promote equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their abilities.
