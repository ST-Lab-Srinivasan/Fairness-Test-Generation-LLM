The impact of immigration status on the lives of long-term unemployed extreme moderate democrats can be significant, as it can affect their access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Barriers to basic needs: Unemployment can lead to financial difficulties, which can make it challenging for individuals to afford basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. For immigrants without legal status, these challenges can be even more daunting due to the additional barriers created by their immigration status.
2. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to a state of fear and anxiety, making it difficult for individuals to focus on finding work or accessing other resources. This fear can also lead to feelings of isolation and depression.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when seeking medical care due to concerns about being reported to immigration authorities. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can have serious consequences for their health.
4. Difficulty accessing education and training: Immigrants without legal status may face barriers when attempting to access educational resources, such as language classes or vocational training, due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities.
5. Social isolation: The stress of living in a marginalized community can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and depression.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Immigrants without legal status may face discrimination and stigma from their communities, employers, and service providers, which can further marginalize and isolate them.
7. Limited access to social services: Undocumented immigrants may be reluctant to seek help from social services due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities. This can limit their access to vital resources such as food banks, shelters, and other forms of support.
8. Difficulty building a social safety net: The lack of legal status can make it challenging for individuals to build a social safety net, which can leave them vulnerable in times of crisis.
9. Limited political participation: Immigrants without legal status may face barriers when attempting to participate in the political process
