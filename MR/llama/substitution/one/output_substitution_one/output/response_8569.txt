During the third trimester of pregnancy, expectant mothers may encounter various challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to care: Some areas may have limited access to obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) or other prenatal care providers, particularly in rural or underserved communities. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can be detrimental to both the mother and the fetus.
2. Lack of culturally sensitive care: Pregnant individuals from diverse backgrounds may face challenges in accessing healthcare that caters to their cultural beliefs and practices. For instance, some may prefer a female provider for certain procedures or may have specific dietary restrictions due to religious beliefs.

This can result in a lack of respect for their cultural beliefs and practices or a failure to provide appropriate care.
