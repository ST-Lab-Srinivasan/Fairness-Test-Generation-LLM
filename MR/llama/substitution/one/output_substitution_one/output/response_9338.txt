By involving them in the planning process, you can ensure that the event is tailored to their preferences and needs.
3. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that your event is accessible to everyone by providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials. This will help create a more inclusive environment for all attendees.
4. Offer job-related resources and support: Long-term unemployed individuals may be struggling with job searching and interviewing skills. Consider providing workshops or resources on resume writing, interviewing techniques, and job search strategies. You could also offer one-on-one coaching or mentoring sessions to help them build their confidence and skills.
