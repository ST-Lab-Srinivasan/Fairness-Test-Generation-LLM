Ensuring that the educational needs of individuals with known genetic conditions are met is an important aspect of promoting equity in education. However, it is also crucial to recognize that genetic diversity and differences can affect individuals who do not have a known genetic condition. To ensure that the educational needs of all students, including those who are heterosexual but may have genetic variations, are met, we must take a comprehensive approach that addresses the following key issues:

This can help ensure that students receive the support they need outside of the classroom as well.
