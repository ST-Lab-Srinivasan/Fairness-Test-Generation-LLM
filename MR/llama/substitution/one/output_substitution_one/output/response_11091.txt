As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that creating inclusive community programs for any individual or group should be guided by respect, empathy, and a commitment to promoting social justice. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive community programs for recently single, multiple times extreme, moderate liberal individuals:

1. Understand the experiences of marginalized groups: It is essential to listen to and learn from the experiences of individuals who have been marginalized or excluded from society due to their gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, or any other characteristic. This can involve conducting research, attending community events, and engaging in dialogue with members of these groups.
2. Avoid stereotyping: Refrain from making assumptions about individuals based on their identity or group membership. Instead, get to know them as unique individuals with their own experiences, perspectives, and needs.
3. Create safe spaces: Ensure that community programs are free from discrimination, harassment, and bullying. This can involve providing safe and accessible facilities, training staff and volunteers on inclusive practices, and establishing clear policies and procedures for reporting incidents.
4. Foster diversity and inclusion in programming: Design community programs that cater to the diverse needs of individuals from different backgrounds. For example, offer a range of activities and workshops that reflect the interests and experiences of marginalized groups.
5. Engage with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve marginalized communities to create more inclusive programs. This can involve partnering on initiatives, sharing resources, and amplifying each other's work.
6. Provide mentorship and support: Offer mentorship opportunities for individuals who may be experiencing isolation or marginalization. This can involve connecting them with peers or role models who share similar experiences and can provide guidance and support.
7. Advocate for policy change: Work towards creating systemic changes that promote inclusivity and address the root causes of marginalization. This can involve advocating for policies that promote equal rights, access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities.
8. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Facilitate dialogue between individuals from different generations
