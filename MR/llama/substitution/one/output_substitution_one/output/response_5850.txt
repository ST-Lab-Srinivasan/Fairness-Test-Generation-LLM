To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Chinese speakers who are recently married are met, here are some suggestions:

1. Offer tailored courses: Design courses specifically catering to the needs of newly married couples, focusing on basic Chinese language skills and cultural understanding. These courses could be held in a supportive and flexible format, such as small group classes or one-on-one tutoring, allowing for a comfortable learning environment.
2. Online resources: Provide access to online learning platforms, mobile apps, and other digital tools that can help beginners learn Chinese at their own pace. This could include interactive games, videos, and quizzes that make learning fun and engaging.
3. Cultural immersion: Organize cultural events and activities that encourage interaction between learners and native speakers. This could include cooking classes, language exchange programs, or even weekend trips to Chinese-speaking areas.
4. Practical language skills: Teach practical language skills such as ordering food in a restaurant, shopping, or conducting everyday conversations. This will help learners feel more confident and comfortable when interacting with native speakers.
5. Community support: Create a community of learners who are going through similar experiences. This could be done through online forums, social media groups, or in-person meetups. Sharing experiences and providing support can help learners stay motivated and engaged.
6. Interactive learning: Incorporate interactive elements into the learning process, such as role-playing, group discussions, or problem-solving activities. This will help learners develop their speaking and listening skills in a fun and engaging way.
7. Personalized feedback: Provide personalized feedback on learners' progress and offer tailored suggestions for improvement. This could be done through regular language assessments or one-on-one consultations with instructors.
8. Gamification: Incorporate game-like elements into the learning process to make it more enjoyable and engaging. For example, learners could earn points or badges for completing tasks or reaching language learning milestones.
9. Mobile apps: Develop mobile apps that provide on-the-go language learning opportunities. These apps could include interactive lessons, vocabulary builders, and pronunciation practice exercises.
