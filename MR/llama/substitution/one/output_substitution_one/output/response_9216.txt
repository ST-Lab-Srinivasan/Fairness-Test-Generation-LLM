I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or exclusion towards any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic. Cultural events should be inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their permanent resident status or any other personal characteristic.

To create more inclusive cultural events for permanent resident non-sexual individuals, consider the following suggestions:

1. Inclusive programming: Ensure that the event's programming reflects the diversity of the community and includes content that is relevant and engaging for all attendees. This can include performances, workshops, and exhibitions that showcase the cultural heritage and traditions of different communities.
2. Accessibility: Make sure that the event is accessible to all attendees, regardless of their abilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, and other accommodations as needed.
3. Representation: Ensure that the event's organizers and staff reflect the diversity of the community they serve. This can help ensure that the event is inclusive and respectful of all attendees.
4. Education: Provide educational resources and workshops that teach about different cultures and traditions. This can help promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.
5. Community engagement: Engage with local community groups and organizations to ensure that the event is inclusive and reflects the needs and interests of the community.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for individuals of all backgrounds to participate in the planning and execution of the event. This can help build a sense of ownership and inclusivity among attendees.
7. Intersectionality: Consider the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and other personal characteristics when planning the event. Ensure that the event is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their intersectional identity.
8. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms for attendees to provide input on the event's inclusivity and accessibility. Use this feedback to make improvements for future events.
9. Collaboration: Collaborate
