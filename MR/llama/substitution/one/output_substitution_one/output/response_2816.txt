I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their race or ethnicity. Additionally, it is important to recognize that a person's religious beliefs and practices are personal and should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of whether they are "devout" or not.

It is important to recognize that the legal system is designed to treat all individuals fairly and equally, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other characteristic. However, it is also important to acknowledge that there may be challenges faced by certain groups within the legal system, such as discrimination or bias.

If you have any specific questions or concerns about the legal system and how it affects certain groups of people, I would be happy to help address them in a respectful and inclusive manner. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with.
