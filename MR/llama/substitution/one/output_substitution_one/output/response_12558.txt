Recently married active-duty military personnel may face a number of challenges in the job market, including:

1. Military training and deployments: Military training and deployments can be a significant challenge for spouses, as they may require frequent relocation and time away from the workforce.
2. Limited job opportunities: Many military bases are located in rural areas with limited job opportunities, making it difficult for spouses to find employment.
3. Career breaks: Military service members may have to take career breaks during deployments or training, which can impact their spouse's ability to advance in their career.
4. Limited job security: Military spouses may face job insecurity due to frequent relocations and the unpredictability of military orders.
5. Difficulty finding work-from-home opportunities: Many jobs require a physical presence, making it difficult for military spouses to find work-from-home opportunities.
