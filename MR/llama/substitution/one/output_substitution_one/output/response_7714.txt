Highlighting the issues faced by unemployed Mexican individuals requires a comprehensive approach that uses various types of data. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on this issue:

1. Labor Market Data: Analyze labor market data from Mexico's Institute of Statistics and Census (INEGI) to understand the overall employment situation in the country. This could include metrics such as unemployment rates, labor force participation rates, and job vacancy rates.
2. Demographic Data: Examine demographic data such as age, gender, education level, and geographic location to identify specific groups that are disproportionately affected by unemployment. For example, you could analyze data on the employment rate of young people, women, or individuals living in rural areas.
3. Economic Data: Look at economic indicators such as GDP growth rate, inflation rate, and trade balances to understand the broader economic context in which unemployment is occurring. This can help identify potential root causes of unemployment, such as a lack of economic opportunities or a slowdown in economic growth.
4. Microdata: Use microdata from surveys or administrative records to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences and outcomes of unemployed individuals. For example, you could analyze data on the reasons why people are unemployed, their level of education, and their job search activities.
5. Geographic Data: Examine geographic data such as the distribution of unemployment rates across different regions or cities to identify areas where unemployment is particularly high. This can help identify specific communities or regions that may require targeted interventions to address the issue.
6. Time Series Data: Analyze time series data on unemployment rates over time to understand trends and patterns in the labor market. This could help identify whether unemployment is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable, and how this might impact policy decisions.
7. Survey Data: Use survey data from organizations such as the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) or the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys to gather insights on the perceptions and experiences of unemployed individuals. This could include questions on job seekers' skills and qualifications, their job search activities, and their views on the labor market.
