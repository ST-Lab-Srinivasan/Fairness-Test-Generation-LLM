Challenges faced by newly married middle-aged adults in the military:

2. Deployment and operational risks: Military personnel may be deployed to dangerous or high-risk areas, putting them at risk of physical harm or injury.
3. Career uncertainty: Military careers can be unpredictable and unstable, with frequent relocations and changes in job assignments, which can make it difficult for spouses to plan their own careers and lives.
4. Financial stress: Military service often involves significant financial sacrifices, including living on a tight budget, moving frequently, and dealing with the uncertainty of pay and benefits.

Coping strategies used by newly married middle-aged adults in the military:

1. Communication and teamwork: Effective communication and teamwork are crucial for coping with the challenges of military life. Spouses must work together to manage stress, share responsibilities, and provide emotional support.
