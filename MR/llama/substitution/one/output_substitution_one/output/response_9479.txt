Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of physically disabled long-term recently single people. These individuals may face additional challenges related to their disability and social isolation, which can be exacerbated by immigration status. This study aims to explore the experiences and challenges faced by this group in terms of access to healthcare, social support, and daily living activities.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that individuals with disabilities are more likely to experience social isolation and loneliness, which can have negative impacts on their mental and physical health (Koenen et al., 2014). Additionally, immigration status can affect access to healthcare and social support, which can further exacerbate these challenges (Crawley & Katz, 2015).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, including in-depth interviews with physically disabled long-term recently single people who are non-citizens. Participants will be recruited through community organizations and online forums, and will be purposely sampled to ensure diversity in terms of immigration status and disability type. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and will be analyzed using thematic analysis.

Expected Findings:
The findings of this study are expected to highlight the unique challenges faced by physically disabled long-term recently single people who are non-citizens. These challenges may include:

1. Difficulty accessing healthcare and social support due to immigration status.
2. Social isolation and loneliness, which can exacerbate existing disabilities.
3. Discrimination and stigma related to disability and immigration status.
4. Limited access to education and employment opportunities due to immigration status.
5. Difficulty navigating bureaucratic systems and accessing benefits and resources.

Implications:
The findings of this study have implications for policy and practice, including the need for increased funding and support for organizations that provide services to physically disabled long-term recently single people who are non-citizens. Additionally, there is a need for greater awareness and education around disability and immigration status,
