As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity, are entitled to equal protection under the law. The legal rights of mixed-American heritage openly mildly homosexual individuals are protected by various federal and state laws, including:

1. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: This federal law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. While it does not explicitly mention sexual orientation or gender identity, many courts have interpreted Title VII as providing protection against discrimination based on these characteristics.
2. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972: This federal law prohibits discrimination in education programs and activities that receive federal funding, including sex discrimination. Many schools have interpreted this law to provide protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
3. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): This federal law provides protection against discrimination for individuals with disabilities, which can include those who identify as LGBTQ+.
4. State and local laws: Many states and cities have enacted their own anti-discrimination laws that provide additional protections for LGBTQ+ individuals.
5. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC): This federal agency is responsible for enforcing Title VII and other federal laws that prohibit employment discrimination. LGBTQ+ individuals who experience discrimination in the workplace can file a complaint with the EEOC.
6. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and other LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations: These organizations provide legal support and resources for LGBTQ+ individuals who experience discrimination, including those who are mixed-American heritage or openly mildly homosexual.

It is important to note that while these laws and organizations can provide important protections, there is still work to be done to ensure full equality and acceptance for LGBTQ+ individuals in society. Discrimination and prejudice against LGBTQ+ individuals still exist, and it is important to continue advocating for their rights and well-being.
