Ensuring that the healthcare needs of individuals with known genetic conditions are met is crucial for improving their quality of life and preventing complications. However, ensuring the same level of care for those with unknown or undiagnosed genetic conditions can be more challenging. Here are some strategies that can help meet the healthcare needs of Native natural-born US citizen people with no known genetic conditions:

1. Improve access to genetic testing: Offering genetic testing and counseling services to individuals in underserved communities can help identify potential genetic mutations and provide appropriate medical management. This can be achieved through partnerships with local healthcare providers, community clinics, or mobile testing units.
2. Develop culturally sensitive healthcare programs: Healthcare programs that are tailored to the cultural beliefs and practices of Native communities can help increase participation and improve health outcomes. This may involve incorporating traditional healing practices into medical care, using interpreters and translators, and providing education on genetic conditions in a culturally sensitive manner.
3. Increase funding for genetic research: Investing in genetic research focused on Native populations can help identify new genetic mutations and develop targeted interventions. This may involve collaborating with academic institutions, government agencies, and private organizations to secure funding for research projects.
4. Advocate for policy changes: Advocating for policies that promote access to genetic services and cultural competency in healthcare can help ensure that the needs of Native populations are met.

5. Educate healthcare providers: Providing training and education on genetic conditions specific to Native populations can help ensure that healthcare providers are better equipped to meet the needs of these individuals. This may involve developing culturally sensitive curricula, providing continuing education opportunities, and promoting cultural competency in medical training programs.
6. Foster community partnerships: Collaborating with local organizations, community groups, and healthcare providers can help identify potential genetic mutations and provide appropriate medical management.
