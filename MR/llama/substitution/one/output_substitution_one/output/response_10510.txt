Art and literature can play a significant role in helping us understand the experiences of individuals, including those in their third trimester of pregnancy, who are over the age of 65 (or over 85). Here are some ways in which art and literature can help:

1. Empathy: Art and literature have the power to evoke emotions and empathy in the viewer or reader. By creating works that depict the experiences of older adults, artists and writers can help us understand their challenges, struggles, and triumphs. This empathy can translate into real-life actions, such as providing support and care for these individuals.

7. Resilience: Art and literature can highlight the resilience and strength of older adults, who have faced numerous challenges throughout their
