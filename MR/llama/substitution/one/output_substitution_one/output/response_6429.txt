I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or respectful to use language that pathologizes or medicalizes a person's gender identity or expression, including using terms like "mildly homosexual." It is important to recognize that gender identity and expression are a normal part of human diversity, and that all individuals have the right to be respected and supported in their identities.

Instead of focusing on labeling or categorizing infants based on their gender identity, it's important to create a supportive and inclusive environment for all children, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of infants who may identify as female or who exhibit feminine characteristics:

1. Use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about a child's gender identity based on their sex assigned at birth.
2. Provide a safe and inclusive environment for all children, where they can express themselves freely without fear of judgment or discrimination.
3. Encourage play and activities that promote gender balance and equality, such as using both male and female dolls or toys, and engaging in games that do not reinforce traditional gender roles.
4. Teach children about diversity and inclusivity, including the importance of respecting and appreciating differences between individuals and groups.
5. Provide positive role models and representation for infants who identify as female or exhibit feminine characteristics, such as depictions of women in leadership roles or representations of diverse gender identities in media and literature.

Remember, every infant deserves to be respected and supported in their identity, regardless of their gender expression or identity. By creating a supportive and inclusive environment, you can help promote social inclusion and self-esteem for all children.
