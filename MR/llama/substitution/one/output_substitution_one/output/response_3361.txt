The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently expecting partnered people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care, leading to potential health risks for both the mother and the baby. Legal status can impact access to health insurance and other financial resources needed for prenatal care.
2. Financial stress: The cost of pregnancy and childbirth can be a significant burden, especially for undocumented immigrants who may lack access to affordable healthcare or financial support. Legal status can impact eligibility for government assistance programs like Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act.
3. Fear of deportation: The stress of living with the constant fear of deportation can have a profound impact on mental and physical health, particularly during pregnancy. This fear can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
4. Social isolation: Undocumented immigrants may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can further exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection during pregnancy.

9. Limited access to social services: Legal status can impact access to social services such as food assistance programs, housing support, and other forms of aid that can help newly expecting partners navigate
