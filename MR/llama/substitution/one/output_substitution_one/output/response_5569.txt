As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "natural-born natural-born citizens" is not a legally recognized or scientifically valid term. Additionally, it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their citizenship status or marital status, deserve equal access to healthcare and other basic human rights.

However, I understand your inquiry as a hypothetical scenario. In this context, here are some potential challenges faced by natural-born citizens who are also lifelong residents and recently married people in the healthcare system:

1. Access to healthcare: Despite living in a country with a well-developed healthcare system, some individuals may face difficulties accessing medical care due to various reasons such as financial constraints, lack of health insurance, or limited access to healthcare providers in remote areas.
2. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not always be aware of the unique needs and cultural practices of diverse patient populations, leading to a lack of culturally competent care. This can result in miscommunication, misunderstandings, or unintended harm.
3. Barriers to mental health services: Stigmatization and discrimination against mental illnesses can create barriers for individuals seeking mental health services, particularly for those from marginalized communities.

5. Gender and sexuality-based discrimination: Discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation can result in disparities in access to healthcare, particularly for marginalized communities.
6. Ageism: Older adults may face age-related discrimination in the healthcare system, leading to delayed or inadequate care, as well as social isolation and lack of support.
7. Intersectionality: The intersectionality of identities such as race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status can affect an individual's access to healthcare, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to address these disparities.
8. Language barriers: Individuals with limited proficiency in the dominant language may face challenges
