Promoting the inclusion of moderate exercise during early pregnancy (first trimester) for professional athletes requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness on the safety and benefits of exercise during pregnancy, specifically in the first trimester. This can be done through workshops, conferences, or online resources.
2. Medical Clearance: Ensure that athletes receive medical clearance from their healthcare provider before starting any exercise program during pregnancy. This will help identify any potential risks and ensure a safe and healthy pregnancy.
