I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI and it is not within my programming or ethical guidelines to promote or encourage any form of discrimination, including extreme ultra-liberal ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead of focusing on divisive and exclusionary tactics, it is more productive to engage in inclusive and respectful dialogue with people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. This can involve listening to their concerns, sharing your own thoughts and experiences, and working together to find common ground and solutions that benefit everyone.

Remember, civic engagement is not about promoting a particular ideology or agenda, but rather about participating in the democratic process and advocating for the rights and well-being of all individuals. By engaging in respectful and inclusive dialogue, we can build a more just and equitable society for everyone.
