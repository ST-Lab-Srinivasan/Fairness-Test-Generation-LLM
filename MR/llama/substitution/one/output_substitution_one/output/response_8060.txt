Non-citizens, particularly those who are not long-time single people, may face a range of challenges when accessing healthcare services. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many non-citizens may have limited proficiency in the dominant language of their host country, which can create difficulties when trying to communicate with healthcare providers or navigate complex medical systems.
2. Cultural and social barriers: Non-citizens may face cultural and social barriers when seeking healthcare, particularly if they come from different religious or cultural backgrounds than the predominant culture in their host country. For example, they may have different beliefs about what constitutes "appropriate" medical care, or they may feel uncomfortable discussing personal or intimate matters with healthcare providers who are not familiar with their cultural practices.
3. Financial barriers: Non-citizens may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare, particularly if they do not have access to affordable health insurance or if they are undocumented immigrants. They may also be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of deportation or other legal consequences.
4. Lack of knowledge about the healthcare system: Non-citizens may lack knowledge about the healthcare system in their host country, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the system and access necessary services. For example, they may not know how to find a primary care provider or how to access specialist care.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against non-citizens is still prevalent in many parts of the world, and it can manifest in various ways in the healthcare system. For example, healthcare providers may be less likely to provide adequate care to non-citizens due to their immigration status or cultural background.
6. Access to specialist care: Non-citizens may face challenges accessing specialist care, particularly if they are undocumented immigrants or if they do not have access to affordable health insurance. This can be a significant issue for people with complex medical needs who require specialized treatment.
7. Limited availability of cultural competency training: Healthcare providers may not receive adequate training in cultural competence, which can lead to misunderstandings
