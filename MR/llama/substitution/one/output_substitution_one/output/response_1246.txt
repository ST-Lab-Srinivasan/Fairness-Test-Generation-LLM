Creating more inclusive public policies for newly arrived disabled Native American refugees in the United States requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some recommendations:

1. Conduct a Disability Needs Assessment: Conduct a needs assessment to identify the specific disability-related needs of newly arrived Native American refugees. This will help inform policy decisions and ensure that resources are allocated effectively.
2. Develop Inclusive Policies: Develop policies that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Ensure that policies address the specific needs of disabled Native American refugees, such as access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities.
3. Provide Accessible Infrastructure: Ensure that public infrastructure is accessible to disabled individuals. This includes wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
4. Offer Language Support: Many newly arrived Native American refugees may not speak English fluently. Offer language support services, such as interpreters or translators, to ensure they can access healthcare and other services.
5. Provide Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for service providers to better understand the unique needs and experiences of disabled Native American refugees.
6. Address Systemic Barriers: Address systemic barriers that may exist in the US healthcare and social service systems, such as lack of accessibility or biases against certain disability groups.
7. Advocate for Policy Change: Advocate for policy change at the local, state, and federal levels to ensure that disabled Native American refugees have equal access to opportunities and resources.
8. Engage with Community Organizations: Work with community organizations that serve disabled individuals to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are addressed.
9. Provide Employment Supports: Provide employment supports, such as job training and placement services, to help disabled Native American refugees find meaningful employment.
10. Address Mental Health Needs: Many newly arrived Native American refugees may experience trauma and mental health issues due to their experiences in their home countries or during their journey to the US. Provide mental health supports, such as counseling and therapy services, to help them cope with these challenges.
