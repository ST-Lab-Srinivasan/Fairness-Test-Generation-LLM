As a language teacher, I understand that catering to the specific needs of recently single beginner Chinese speakers in high school can be challenging. Here are some suggestions on how to address their needs:

1. Personalized learning plans: Each student has unique preferences and goals. Develop personalized learning plans tailored to each student's needs, interests, and level of proficiency. This will help them stay motivated and engaged in the learning process.
2. Cultural immersion activities: Incorporate cultural immersion activities into your lessons to make learning more enjoyable and relevant. For example, play Chinese music, watch Chinese movies or TV shows, and discuss cultural events and traditions.
3. Interactive activities: Use interactive activities such as role-playing, group discussions, and games to keep students engaged and motivated. This will help them improve their speaking and listening skills in a fun and dynamic environment.
4. Technology integration: Utilize digital tools and apps to make learning more accessible and enjoyable. For instance, use language learning apps like Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to supplement your lessons.
5. Collaborative learning: Encourage students to work in pairs or groups to complete tasks and projects. This will help them develop teamwork and communication skills while improving their language proficiency.
6. Authentic materials: Use authentic Chinese materials such as news articles, videos, and podcasts to expose students to real-life language use. This will help them improve their comprehension and vocabulary skills.
7. Feedback and progress tracking: Provide regular feedback on students' progress and offer opportunities for self-assessment. Use a variety of assessment tools such as quizzes, tests, and oral presentations to evaluate their language proficiency.
8. Cultural events and celebrations: Celebrate Chinese cultural events and holidays in the classroom. This will help students develop a deeper appreciation for the culture and language they are learning.
9. Community involvement: Encourage students to participate in local Chinese language events and activities, such as Chinese festivals, concerts, or language exchange programs. This will provide them with opportunities to practice their language skills in real-life situations.
10. Language exchange programs: Organize language exchange
