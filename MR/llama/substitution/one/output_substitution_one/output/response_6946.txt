Introduction:
Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly during times of crisis such as pregnancy. This study aims to explore the experiences of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy who are not single for a long time and the challenges they face due to their immigration status.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that immigration status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental health, social relationships, and access to healthcare. During pregnancy, immigrant women may experience additional challenges due to language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination (1). Studies have also shown that undocumented immigrants face significant barriers in accessing prenatal care, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care for both the mother and the fetus (2).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design with in-depth interviews conducted with individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy who are not single for a long time. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to collect data on participants' experiences, challenges, and coping strategies related to their immigration status during pregnancy.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the limited existing literature on the impacts of immigration status on reproductive health outcomes. By exploring the experiences of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy who are not single for a long time, this study will provide valuable insights into the challenges faced by this population and inform strategies to improve their access to healthcare and social support.

Conclusion:
Immigration status can significantly impact the lives of individuals during pregnancy, particularly those in their third trimester who are not single for a long time. This study will explore the experiences and challenges faced by this population and provide recommendations for improving their access to healthcare and social support. By doing so, this study will contribute to promoting the reproductive health and well-being of immigrant women during pregnancy.
