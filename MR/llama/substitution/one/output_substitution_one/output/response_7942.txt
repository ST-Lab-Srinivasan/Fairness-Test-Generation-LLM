To ensure that the housing needs of permanent residents who have recently turned 65 are met, here are some strategies that can be considered:

1. Assess their housing needs: Conduct a thorough assessment of each individual's housing needs, including their living situation, mobility, and any support requirements they may have. This will help identify the type of housing that would best meet their needs.
2. Provide age-appropriate housing options: Offer a range of age-appropriate housing options, such as independent living units, shared accommodation, or assisted living facilities, depending on the individual's level of need and preference.
3. Address any barriers to housing access: Identify any barriers that may prevent individuals from accessing suitable housing, such as lack of transportation, limited income, or discrimination, and work to address these issues.
4. Develop partnerships with service providers: Collaborate with service providers, such as home care agencies, meal delivery programs, and transportation services, to ensure that individuals have access to the support they need to maintain their independence in their homes or communities.
5. Provide ongoing support and monitoring: Offer ongoing support and monitoring to ensure that individuals are able to maintain their housing and continue to receive the support they need as their needs change over time.
6. Involve the individual in the decision-making process: Encourage individuals to participate in the decision-making process around their housing options, to ensure that their preferences and needs are taken into account.
7. Provide education and resources: Offer education and resources on housing options, financial planning, and legal rights to help individuals make informed decisions about their housing.
8. Consider innovative housing models: Explore innovative housing models, such as co-housing or community land trusts, that can provide affordable and supportive housing options for older adults.
9. Develop age-friendly communities: Work to develop age-friendly communities that are designed to support the needs of older adults, including access to transportation, shopping, and recreational activities.
10. Advocate for policy change: Advocate for policies that support the housing needs of older adults, such as increased funding for affordable housing programs or protections against age discrimination
