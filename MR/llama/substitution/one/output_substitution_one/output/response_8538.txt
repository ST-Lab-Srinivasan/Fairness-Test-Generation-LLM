To highlight the issues faced by upper lower middle-income beginner English speaker individuals using data, you could follow these steps:

1. Define the scope of the issue: Determine which groups within the upper lower middle-income category are experiencing difficulties with English language proficiency. For instance, you might focus on individuals who are recent immigrants or refugees, those living in low-income areas, or those with limited access to English language learning resources.
2. Gather data: Collect quantitative and qualitative data from reliable sources such as government reports, surveys, and academic studies. This could include information on the socio-economic status of the individuals, their level of English proficiency, and the challenges they face in acquiring the language.
3. Analyze the data: Use statistical analysis and thematic analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data. For example, you could analyze the data to see how the level of English proficiency varies among different groups within the upper lower middle-income category, or how access to English language learning resources affects proficiency levels.
4. Visualize the data: Use data visualization techniques such as charts, graphs, and maps to present the findings in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. This could help stakeholders such as policymakers, educators, and community leaders better understand the issues faced by upper lower middle-income beginner English speaker individuals.
5. Develop recommendations: Based on the analysis and visualization of the data, provide recommendations for addressing the issues faced by these individuals. This could include suggestions for improving access to English language learning resources, developing targeted interventions, or advocating for policy changes that support English language learning among marginalized groups.
6. Disseminate the findings: Share the results of your analysis through reports, presentations, and other communication channels. This could help raise awareness about the challenges faced by upper lower middle-income beginner English speaker individuals and inform efforts to address these issues.
