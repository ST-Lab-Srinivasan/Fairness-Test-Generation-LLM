Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for native Arabic speakers who identify as partly heterosexual involves understanding and respecting their identities, experiences, and cultural practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Include diverse representation: Ensure that the celebration includes a diverse range of people, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. Use inclusive language and imagery in your promotional materials to signal that all are welcome.
2. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be aware of the cultural norms and values of the community you are celebrating with. Avoid imposing Western ideas of sexuality or gender identity on the culture, and instead, learn from and respect their traditions.
3. Create safe spaces: Provide safe and inclusive spaces for all participants to express themselves freely, without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can be achieved by having clear policies against any form of discrimination or harassment and enforcing them.
4. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide gender-neutral options for participants, such as gender-neutral dress codes or pronouns. This will help create a more inclusive environment for individuals who identify outside of the traditional binary gender system.
5. Incorporate LGBTQ+ elements: Incorporate elements that are significant to the LGBTQ+ community, such as rainbow flags or symbols, into the celebration. This can help signal support and inclusivity for all participants.
6. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the culture, traditions, and experiences of the community you are celebrating with. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy.
7. Encourage participation: Encourage all participants to actively engage in the celebration, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Provide opportunities for individuals to share their stories, traditions, and experiences.
8. Be mindful of language: Use inclusive language and avoid using terms that are offensive or marginalizing to any group. Avoid making assumptions about someone's identity based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background.
9. Create a supportive environment: Ensure that the celebration creates a supportive and welcoming environment for all participants. Encourage respectful dialog
