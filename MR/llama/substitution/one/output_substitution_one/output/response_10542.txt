Ensuring that the healthcare needs of non-deeply poor Native English Speaker (NEST) people are met requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various factors, including accessibility, affordability, and cultural competency. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Improve accessibility: Ensure that healthcare facilities and services are easily accessible to NESTs by locating them in convenient areas, providing clear directions, and offering flexible appointment scheduling.
2. Promote affordability: Reduce out-of-pocket costs for NESTs by implementing cost-sharing models, such as copays or coinsurance, that are more manageable than traditional fee-for-service models. Governments can also invest in programs like Medicaid or other public insurance plans to increase access to affordable healthcare.
3. Enhance cultural competency: Ensure that healthcare providers are culturally aware and sensitive to the needs of NESTs. This includes training providers on cultural competency, interpreters and translators for non-English speakers, and addressing any cultural barriers to care.

Healthcare providers can collaborate with community organizations to address these issues and provide holistic care.
5. Leverage technology: Utilize telehealth or digital health platforms to expand access to care for NESTs who may face barriers to traditional in-person care. This can include virtual consultations, remote monitoring, and mobile health apps.

7. Foster community partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations, such as community clinics or social service agencies, to provide a network of support for NESTs. This can help address health disparities and ensure that patients receive comprehensive care.
8. Develop targeted interventions: Identify specific health disparities among NESTs and develop tailored interventions to address them. For example,
