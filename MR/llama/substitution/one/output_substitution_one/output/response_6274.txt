As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their wealth or marital status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. However, I understand the request for more inclusive social policies for wealthy, newly single individuals. Here are some potential policies that could promote greater inclusivity:

1. Re-evaluate the tax system: Wealthy individuals often benefit from lower tax rates than those who are less well-off.
