Creating more inclusive housing policies for individuals who are experiencing a first-trimester pregnancy, particularly those who have not been recently single, requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some strategies that can help create a more supportive and inclusive housing environment:

1. Accommodation requests: Allow individuals to make accommodation requests during the first trimester of pregnancy, such as permission to keep their pregnancy private or flexibility in rent payments if they experience morning sickness or other pregnancy-related symptoms.
2. Pregnancy support services: Offer resources and support services specifically for pregnant individuals, such as prenatal care, childbirth classes, and postpartum support. This can help ensure that these individuals receive the necessary care and attention during this critical time.
3. Flexible lease agreements: Consider offering flexible lease agreements that allow individuals to temporarily pause their rent payments or make adjustments to their lease terms due to pregnancy-related issues. This can help alleviate financial stress and ensure that individuals receive the support they need during this time.
4. Accessibility features: Ensure that housing facilities are accessible and accommodating for individuals with mobility challenges related to pregnancy. Installing grab bars, non-slip flooring, and widening doorways can help create a safer and more comfortable environment for these individuals.
5. Private space: Provide private spaces for individuals who may need additional privacy and comfort during the first trimester of pregnancy. This could include designated breastfeeding areas or quiet rooms where they can rest and relax.
6. Education and training: Offer education and training programs for housing staff and landlords on how to support pregnant individuals, including those who have not been recently single. This can help ensure that these individuals receive the appropriate level of care and attention during their pregnancy.
7. Communication: Encourage open communication between housing staff, landlords, and pregnant individuals to address any concerns or issues that may arise. This can help build trust and ensure that these individuals receive the support they need during this time.
8. Inclusive policies: Develop inclusive policies that consider the needs of all pregnant individuals, regardless of their marital status
