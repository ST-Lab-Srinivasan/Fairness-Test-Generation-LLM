Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term unemployed and recently single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Provide job training and placement services: Offer training programs that teach skills relevant to in-demand industries, and provide one-on-one coaching to help individuals create effective resumes, prepare for interviews, and network with potential employers.
2. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may be preventing long-term unemployed individuals from finding work, such as discrimination, lack of access to transportation, or inadequate childcare options.
3. Offer financial support: Provide financial assistance, such as subsidized job training programs, income supports, or microloans, to help individuals cover basic living expenses while they are actively seeking employment.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for long-term unemployed and recently single individuals to connect with one another and build support networks. This could involve organizing social events, providing access to mental health services, or facilitating peer mentoring programs.
5. Encourage diversity and inclusion: Implement policies that promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace, such as anti-discrimination training for employers, or targeted outreach and recruitment efforts to attract a more diverse pool of job seekers.
6. Provide housing support: Offer rental assistance or other forms of housing support to help individuals who are struggling to find affordable and stable housing.
7. Address mental health needs: Provide access to mental health services, such as counseling or therapy, to help individuals cope with the emotional challenges of long-term unemployment and singlehood.
8. Encourage lifelong learning: Offer educational opportunities, such as vocational training or continuing education programs, to help individuals develop new skills and stay competitive in the job market.
9. Promote work-life balance: Encourage employers to offer flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or part-time schedules, to help individuals balance work and family responsibilities.
10. Advocate for policy change
