Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for early teenage native English speakers (ages 13-15) requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach to ensure that all participants feel valued and included. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Involve young people in the planning process: Give them a voice and allow them to contribute their ideas and perspectives on how they would like to celebrate their cultural heritage. This will help create a sense of ownership and investment in the event.
2. Provide diverse representation: Make sure that the cultural celebration reflects the diversity of the community it serves. This can be achieved by including music, dance, art, and food from different cultures and backgrounds.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language or terminology that could be offensive or alienating to any particular group. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all participants.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for young people to participate in the celebration, such as leading a cultural dance or performance, reciting poetry or singing traditional songs.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage interactions between participants from different cultural backgrounds. This can be achieved by creating collaborative activities that bring people together and promote mutual respect and appreciation.
6. Provide accessible accommodations: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpreters or wheelchair accessibility.
7. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and traditions of the communities being celebrated. Avoid using cultural elements in a way that could be seen as disrespectful or insensitive.
8. Offer educational components: Provide opportunities for young people to learn about different cultures through workshops, lectures, or presentations. This can help create a deeper appreciation and understanding of the cultural diversity being celebrated.
9. Encourage intergenerational participation: Involve elderly members of the community in the planning and execution of the celebration. This can help create a sense of connection and continuity between generations.
10. Be adaptable: Be prepared to make adjustments as needed to ensure that the cultural celebration is inclusive
