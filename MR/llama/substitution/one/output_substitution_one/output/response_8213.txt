The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of non-democratically employed individuals, including:

1. Limited job opportunities: In authoritarian regimes, non-democratically employed individuals may face limited job opportunities and career advancement prospects due to political connections and nepotism.
2. Political repression: Non-democratically employed individuals may be at risk of political repression, including surveillance, imprisonment, or even torture, if they are deemed a threat to the ruling authority.
3. Economic inequality: Authoritarian regimes often perpetuate economic inequality by restricting access to education and job opportunities for non-democratically employed individuals, leading to a widening wealth gap between the elite and the general population.
4. Lack of social mobility: In authoritarian regimes, social mobility is often limited, making it difficult for non-democratically employed individuals to improve their socio-economic status through hard work and meritocracy.
5. Brain drain: Non-democratically employed individuals may be discouraged from pursuing higher education or seeking better opportunities abroad due to political instability, corruption, or limited job prospects in their home country.
6. Psychological impacts: Living under an authoritarian regime can have significant psychological impacts on non-democratically employed individuals, including anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness.
7. Limited access to information: Non-democratically employed individuals may have limited access to information about their rights and freedoms, as well as the political situation in their country, making it difficult for them to make informed decisions about their lives and livelihoods.
8. Dependence on the state: Authoritarian regimes often rely on a patronage system, where non-democratically employed individuals are dependent on the state for their employment and livelihood. This can create a culture of dependency and reduce incentives for innovation and entrepreneurship.
9. Lack of civil society participation: Non-democratically employed individuals may face barriers to participating in civil society organizations or advocacy efforts, as they may be seen as a threat to the ruling authority or face reprisals for their activism.
