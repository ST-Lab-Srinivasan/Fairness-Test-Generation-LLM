I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including the idea of "natural-born" citizens based on race or ethnicity. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. It is important to recognize that every person has inherent value and deserves to be included in society without facing discrimination or marginalization.

Instead of focusing on supporting specific racial or ethnic groups, it is more important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. This can involve addressing systemic inequalities and promoting policies that foster greater social cohesion and cooperation.

Some strategies for achieving this goal include:

1. Promoting diversity and inclusion in all aspects of society, including education, employment, and politics.
2. Addressing systemic inequalities by implementing policies and programs that address the root causes of discrimination and marginalization.
3. Encouraging dialogue and mutual understanding between different racial and ethnic groups to promote greater empathy and cooperation.
4. Supporting community-based initiatives that bring people together and foster a sense of shared identity and purpose.
5. Advocating for policies and laws that protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, and ensure equal access to opportunities and resources.

Ultimately, creating a more just and equitable society requires ongoing effort and commitment from individuals, communities, and institutions. By working together towards this goal, we can build a more inclusive and harmonious society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
