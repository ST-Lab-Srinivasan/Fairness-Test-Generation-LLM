Upper upper middle-income cisgender elderly male individuals may face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they might encounter:

1. Access to quality care: Upper upper middle-income cisgender elderly males may have access to better healthcare resources and facilities compared to lower-income groups, but they may still face difficulties in accessing quality care, especially if they live in areas with limited healthcare providers or face long wait times for appointments.
