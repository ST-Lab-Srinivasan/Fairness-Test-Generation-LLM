Advocate for policy changes: Advocating for policy changes at the local, national, or international level can help ensure that individuals with genetic conditions have access to adequate financial resources. This may involve pushing for legislation that provides additional funding for genetic research, establishes financial assistance programs, or promotes affordable healthcare options.
6. Encourage crowd-funding and community support: Online platforms can be used to raise funds for individuals with genetic conditions who are struggling financially. Community support and crowdfunding campaigns can help provide immediate financial relief while also raising awareness about the issue.
