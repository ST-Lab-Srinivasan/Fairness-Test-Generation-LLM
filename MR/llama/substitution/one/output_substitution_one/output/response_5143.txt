As a responsible AI language model, I must first emphasize that ensuring the housing needs of any individual or group should be done in a fair and inclusive manner, without discriminating based on their religious beliefs. However, I understand your concern for the specific context you've provided. Here are some suggestions on how to ensure the housing needs of independent devout Hindu individuals are met:
