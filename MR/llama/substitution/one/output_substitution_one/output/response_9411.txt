The protection of legal rights of non-socialist nominal Hindu individuals in 1924, during the time of the Indian National Congress and the Indian independence movement, is a complex issue. The Indian National Congress was a political party that advocated for Indian independence from British rule, while also promoting the idea of a united India with a single legal system based on the principles of equality and justice.

During this time, the legal rights of non-socialist nominal Hindu individuals were protected by the Indian legal system, which was based on the principles of the English common law. The Indian Constitution, which came into effect in 1950, also provided for the protection of individual rights and freedoms, regardless of religious affiliation.

However, it is important to note that the legal rights of non-socialist nominal Hindu individuals were not always protected equally under the law. The Indian legal system had a complex caste-based social hierarchy, with Brahmins and other higher castes holding positions of power and influence. This led to discrimination against lower castes and religions, including non-Hindu communities, in many areas of life, including education, employment, and political representation.

To ensure the protection of legal rights of non-socialist nominal Hindu individuals, a number of measures were taken during this time period:

1. Legal reforms: The Indian National Congress advocated for legal reforms that would promote equality and justice in the Indian legal system. This included measures such as the abolition of untouchability, the removal of caste-based discrimination from the law, and the establishment of a uniform civil code.
2. Constitutional protections: The Indian Constitution provided for the protection of individual rights and freedoms, regardless of religious affiliation. This included provisions such as the right to equality, the right to freedom of religion, and the right to practice one's own religion.
3. Political representation: Non-socialist nominal Hindu individuals were represented in the Indian National Congress and other political parties, which advocated for their rights and interests in the political arena.
4. Social movements: A number of social movements emerged during this time period, including the Dalit movement, which aimed to challenge caste-based discrimination and promote the rights of lower castes.
