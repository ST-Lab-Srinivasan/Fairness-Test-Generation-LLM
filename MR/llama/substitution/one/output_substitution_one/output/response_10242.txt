The mental health of recently arrived refugees in the US can be significantly impacted by their experiences of violence, trauma, and displacement. Here are some ways to support the mental health of these individuals:

1. Access to Mental Health Services: Ensure that refugees have access to mental health services, such as counseling, therapy, and psychiatric care. This can help them process their experiences and manage any emotional distress they may be experiencing.

7. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Teach mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization, to help refugees manage stress and anxiety.
8. Education and Advocacy: Provide education and advocacy services to help refugees understand their mental health rights and navigate the US healthcare system. This can include information on accessing mental health services, understanding insurance coverage, and finding affordable care.
9. Case Management: Offer case management services to connect refugees with other resources they may need, such as housing, food assistance, and employ
