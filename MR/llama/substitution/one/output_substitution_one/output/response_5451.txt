Instead of focusing on celebrating the cultural contributions of mixed Caucasian heritage people who are living in poverty, it's important to address the systemic issues that contribute to poverty and inequality. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Advocate for policies that promote economic mobility and reduce poverty, such as increasing the minimum wage, improving access to affordable housing, and investing in education and job training programs.
2. Support organizations that provide essential services to low-income communities, such as food banks, health clinics, and after-school programs.
3. Engage in dialogue with individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives to raise awareness about the issues facing low-income communities and work towards finding solutions.
4. Use your platform or influence to amplify the voices of marginalized communities and bring attention to the systemic inequalities they face.
5. Support local businesses and initiatives that promote economic development and job creation in low-income areas.

Remember, addressing poverty and inequality requires a comprehensive approach that involves policy changes, community engagement, and individual actions. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
