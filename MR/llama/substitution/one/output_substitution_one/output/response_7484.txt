Regarding the challenges faced by beginner immigrant natural-born US citizen people in the legal system, there are several obstacles that can arise due to language barriers, cultural differences, and systemic inequalities. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Immigrants may face difficulties navigating complex legal systems and accessing essential resources such as legal aid services, interpreter services, and translated documents.
2. Language barriers: Many immigrants may struggle with English proficiency, which can hinder their ability to communicate effectively with legal professionals, understand court proceedings, and navigate legal forms and documents.
3. Cultural differences: Immigrants may have different cultural backgrounds and values that can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications with legal professionals. For example, some cultures may have different expectations about the role of lawyers or the pace of legal proceedings.
4. Systemic inequalities: The legal system can be biased towards those who are more privileged or have greater access to resources and opportunities. This can result in unequal treatment under the law, particularly for immigrants from marginalized communities.
5. Lack of trust: Immigrants may be hesitant to seek legal assistance due to a lack of trust in the legal system or fear of deportation.
6. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: Many immigrants face barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities, which can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and access legal resources.

8. Lack of representation: Immigrants may have limited access to legal representation, particularly if they cannot afford legal services or do not speak English fluently.
