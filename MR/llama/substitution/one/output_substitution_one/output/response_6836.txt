I apologize, but the term "native Caucasian speaker Nigerian people" is not a recognized or valid ethnic or racial category. Nigeria is a country with a diverse population that includes many different ethnic and linguistic groups, including the Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and Fulani, among others.

In terms of healthcare challenges faced by people in Nigeria, there are several factors that contribute to disparities in access and quality of care. Some of these include:

1. Limited resources: Nigeria faces significant resource constraints, including a lack of funding for healthcare infrastructure and personnel. This can result in inadequate facilities, equipment, and supplies, which can hinder the delivery of high-quality care.
2. Brain drain: Many Nigerian healthcare professionals choose to emigrate to other countries for better opportunities, leading to a shortage of skilled workers in the country.
3. Political instability: Nigeria has experienced periods of political instability and conflict, which can disrupt healthcare services and limit access to care.
4. Cultural barriers: In some parts of Nigeria, traditional beliefs and practices may influence health-seeking behaviors and attitudes towards modern medicine.
5. Limited access to healthcare: Many rural areas in Nigeria have limited access to healthcare facilities, making it difficult for people living in these areas to receive quality care.
6. High out-of-pocket expenses: In many parts of Nigeria, patients are required to pay a significant portion of the cost of healthcare services out of pocket, which can be a barrier to accessing care, particularly for low-income individuals.
7. Limited availability of specialized care: Nigeria has limited specialized healthcare facilities and personnel, which can make it difficult for patients to access specialized care, such as cancer treatment or cardiovascular surgery.
8. Inadequate data and statistics: There is a lack of reliable data and statistics on healthcare in Nigeria, which makes it challenging to assess the impact of interventions and identify areas for improvement.
9. Limited access to essential medicines: Many essential medicines are not readily available in Nigeria, particularly in rural areas, due to stockouts, distribution challenges, and high transportation
